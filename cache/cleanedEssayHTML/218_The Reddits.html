        <br /><br />March 2024<br /><br />I met the Reddits before we even
        started Y Combinator. In fact they were one of the reasons we started
        it.<br /><br />YC grew out of a talk I gave to the Harvard Computer
        Society (the undergrad computer club) about how to start a startup.
        Everyone else in the audience was probably local, but Steve and Alexis
        came up on the train from the University of Virginia, where they were
        seniors. Since they'd come so far I agreed to meet them for coffee. They
        told me about the startup idea we'd later fund them to drop: a way to
        order fast food on your cellphone.<br /><br />This was before
        smartphones. They'd have had to make deals with cell carriers and fast
        food chains just to get it launched. So it was not going to happen. It
        still doesn't exist, 19 years later. But I was impressed with their
        brains and their energy. In fact I was so impressed with them and some
        of the other people I met at that talk that I decided to start something
        to fund them. A few days later I told Steve and Alexis that we were
        starting Y&nbsp;Combinator, and encouraged them to apply.<br /><br />That
        first batch we didn't have any way to identify applicants, so we made up
        nicknames for them. The Reddits were the "Cell food muffins." "Muffin"
        is a term of endearment Jessica uses for things like small dogs and two
        year olds. So that gives you some idea what kind of impression Steve and
        Alexis made in those days. They had the look of slightly ruffled
        surprise that baby birds have.<br /><br />Their idea was bad though. And
        since we thought then that we were funding ideas rather than founders,
        we rejected them. But we felt bad about it. Jessica was sad that we'd
        rejected the muffins. And it seemed wrong to me to turn down the people
        we'd been inspired to start YC to fund.<br /><br />I don't think the
        startup sense of the word "pivot" had been invented yet, but we wanted
        to fund Steve and Alexis, so if their idea was bad, they'd have to work
        on something else. And I knew what else. In those days there was a site
        called Delicious where you could save links. It had a page called
        del.icio.us/popular that listed the most-saved links, and people were
        using this page as a de facto Reddit. I knew because a lot of the
        traffic to my site was coming from it. There needed to be something like
        del.icio.us/popular, but designed for sharing links instead of being a
        byproduct of saving them.<br /><br />So I called Steve and Alexis and
        said that we liked them, just not their idea, so we'd fund them if
        they'd work on something else. They were on the train home to Virginia
        at that point. They got off at the next station and got on the next
        train north, and by the end of the day were committed to working on
        what's now called Reddit.<br /><br />They would have liked to call it
        Snoo, as in "What snoo?" But snoo.com was too expensive, so they settled
        for calling the mascot Snoo and picked a name for the site that wasn't
        registered. Early on Reddit was just a provisional name, or so they told
        me at least, but it's probably too late to change it now.<br /><br />As
        with all the really great startups, there's an uncannily close match
        between the company and the founders. Steve in particular. Reddit has a
        certain personality — curious, skeptical, ready to be amused — and that
        personality is Steve's.<br /><br />Steve will roll his eyes at this, but
        he's an intellectual; he's interested in ideas for their own sake. That
        was how he came to be in that audience in Cambridge in the first place.
        He knew me because he was interested in a programming language I've
        written about called Lisp, and Lisp is one of those languages few people
        learn except out of intellectual curiosity. Steve's kind of
        vacuum-cleaner curiosity is exactly what you want when you're starting a
        site that's a list of links to literally anything interesting.<br /><br />Steve
        was not a big fan of authority, so he also liked the idea of a site
        without editors. In those days the top forum for programmers was a site
        called Slashdot. It was a lot like Reddit, except the stories on the
        frontpage were chosen by human moderators. And though they did a good
        job, that one small difference turned out to be a big difference. Being
        driven by user submissions meant Reddit was fresher than Slashdot. News
        there was newer, and users will always go where the newest news is.<br /><br />I
        pushed the Reddits to launch fast. A version one didn't need to be more
        than a couple hundred lines of code. How could that take more than a
        week or two to build? And they did launch comparatively fast, about
        three weeks into the first YC batch. The first users were Steve, Alexis,
        me, and some of their YC batchmates and college friends. It turns out
        you don't need that many users to collect a decent list of interesting
        links, especially if you have multiple accounts per user.<br /><br />Reddit
        got two more people from their YC batch: Chris Slowe and Aaron Swartz,
        and they too were unusually smart. Chris was just finishing his PhD in
        physics at Harvard. Aaron was younger, a college freshman, and even more
        anti-authority than Steve. It's not exaggerating to describe him as a
        martyr for what authority later did to him.<br /><br />Slowly but
        inexorably Reddit's traffic grew. At first the numbers were so small
        they were hard to distinguish from background noise. But within a few
        weeks it was clear that there was a core of real users returning
        regularly to the site. And although all kinds of things have happened to
        Reddit the company in the years since, Reddit the <i>site</i> never
        looked back.<br /><br />Reddit the site (and now app) is such a
        fundamentally useful thing that it's almost unkillable. Which is why,
        despite a long stretch after Steve left when the management strategy
        ranged from benign neglect to spectacular blunders, traffic just kept
        growing. You can't do that with most companies. Most companies you take
        your eye off the ball for six months and you're in deep trouble. But
        Reddit was special, and when Steve came back in 2015, I knew the world
        was in for a surprise.<br /><br />People thought they had Reddit's
        number: one of the players in Silicon Valley, but not one of the big
        ones. But those who knew what had been going on behind the scenes knew
        there was more to the story than this. If Reddit could grow to the size
        it had with management that was harmless at best, what could it do if
        Steve came back? We now know the answer to that question. Or at least a
        lower bound on the answer. Steve is not out of ideas yet.<br /><br /><br /><br />
