        <br /><br />December 2019<br /><br />I've seen the same pattern in many
        different fields: even though lots of people have worked hard in the
        field, only a small fraction of the space of possibilities has been
        explored, because they've all worked on similar things.<br /><br />Even
        the smartest, most imaginative people are surprisingly conservative when
        deciding what to work on. People who would never dream of being
        fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on fashionable
        problems.<br /><br />If you want to try working on unfashionable
        problems, one of the best places to look is in fields that people think
        have already been fully explored: essays, Lisp, venture funding ï¿½ you
        may notice a pattern here. If you can find a new approach into a big but
        apparently played out field, the value of whatever you discover will be
        <a href="sun.html"><u>multiplied</u></a> by its enormous surface
        area.<br /><br />The best protection against getting drawn into working
        on the same things as everyone else may be to
        <a href="genius.html"><u>genuinely love</u></a> what you're doing. Then
        you'll continue to work on it even if you make the same mistake as other
        people and think that it's too marginal to matter.<br /><br />
