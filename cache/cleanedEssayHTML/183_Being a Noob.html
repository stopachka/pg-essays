        <br /><br />January 2020<br /><br />When I was young, I thought old
        people had everything figured out. Now that I'm old, I know this isn't
        true.<br /><br />I constantly feel like a noob. It seems like I'm always
        talking to some startup working in a new field I know nothing about, or
        reading a book about a topic I don't understand well enough, or visiting
        some new country where I don't know how things work.<br /><br />It's not
        pleasant to feel like a noob. And the word "noob" is certainly not a
        compliment. And yet today I realized something encouraging about being a
        noob: the more of a noob you are locally, the less of a noob you are
        globally.<br /><br />For example, if you stay in your home country,
        you'll feel less of a noob than if you move to Farawavia, where
        everything works differently. And yet you'll know more if you move. So
        the feeling of being a noob is inversely correlated with actual
        ignorance.<br /><br />But if the feeling of being a noob is good for us,
        why do we dislike it? What evolutionary purpose could such an aversion
        serve?<br /><br />I think the answer is that there are two sources of
        feeling like a noob: being stupid, and doing something novel. Our
        dislike of feeling like a noob is our brain telling us "Come on, come
        on, figure this out." Which was the right thing to be thinking for most
        of human history. The life of hunter-gatherers was complex, but it
        didn't change as much as life does now. They didn't suddenly have to
        figure out what to do about cryptocurrency. So it made sense to be
        biased toward competence at existing problems over the discovery of new
        ones. It made sense for humans to dislike the feeling of being a noob,
        just as, in a world where food was scarce, it made sense for them to
        dislike the feeling of being hungry.<br /><br />Now that too much food
        is more of a problem than too little, our dislike of feeling hungry
        leads us astray. And I think our dislike of feeling like a noob does
        too.<br /><br />Though it feels unpleasant, and people will sometimes
        ridicule you for it, the more you feel like a noob, the better.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
