        <br /><br />March 2025<br /><br />What should one do? That may seem a
        strange question, but it's not meaningless or unanswerable. It's the
        sort of question kids ask before they learn not to ask big questions. I
        only came across it myself in the process of investigating something
        else. But once I did, I thought I should at least try to answer it.<br /><br />So
        what <i>should</i> one do? One should help people, and take care of the
        world. Those two are obvious. But is there anything else? When I ask
        that, the answer that pops up is
        <i>Make good new things</i>.<br /><br />I can't prove that one should do
        this, any more than I can prove that one should help people or take care
        of the world. We're talking about first principles here. But I can
        explain why this principle makes sense. The most impressive thing humans
        can do is to think. It may be the most impressive thing that can be
        done. And the best kind of thinking, or more precisely the best proof
        that one has thought well, is to make good new things.<br /><br />I mean
        new things in a very general sense. Newton's physics was a good new
        thing. Indeed, the first version of this principle was to have good new
        ideas. But that didn't seem general enough: it didn't include making art
        or music, for example, except insofar as they embody new ideas. And
        while they may embody new ideas, that's not all they embody, unless you
        stretch the word "idea" so uselessly thin that it includes everything
        that goes through your nervous system.<br /><br />Even for ideas that
        one has consciously, though, I prefer the phrasing "make good new
        things." There are other ways to describe the best kind of thinking. To
        make discoveries, for example, or to understand something more deeply
        than others have. But how well do you understand something if you can't
        make a model of it, or write about it? Indeed, trying to express what
        you understand is not just a way to prove that you understand it, but a
        way to understand it better.<br /><br />Another reason I like this
        phrasing is that it biases us toward creation. It causes us to prefer
        the kind of ideas that are naturally seen as making things rather than,
        say, making critical observations about things other people have made.
        Those are ideas too, and sometimes valuable ones, but it's easy to trick
        oneself into believing they're more valuable than they are. Criticism
        seems sophisticated, and making new things often seems awkward,
        especially at first; and yet it's precisely those first steps that are
        most rare and valuable.<br /><br />Is newness essential? I think so.
        Obviously it's essential in science. If you copied a paper of someone
        else's and published it as your own, it would seem not merely
        unimpressive but dishonest. And it's similar in the arts. A copy of a
        good painting can be a pleasing thing, but it's not impressive in the
        way the original was. Which in turn implies it's not impressive to make
        the same thing over and over, however well; you're just copying
        yourself.<br /><br />Note though that we're talking about a different
        kind of should with this principle. Taking care of people and the world
        are shoulds in the sense that they're one's duty, but making good new
        things is a should in the sense that this is how to live to one's full
        potential. Historically most rules about how to live have been a mix of
        both kinds of should, though usually with more of the former than the
        latter.

        ><br /><br />For most of history the question "What should one do?" got
        much the same answer everywhere, whether you asked Cicero or Confucius.
        You should be wise, brave, honest, temperate, and just, uphold
        tradition, and serve the public interest. There was a long stretch where
        in some parts of the world the answer became "Serve God," but in
        practice it was still considered good to be wise, brave, honest,
        temperate, and just, uphold tradition, and serve the public interest.
        And indeed this recipe would have seemed right to most Victorians. But
        there's nothing in it about taking care of the world or making new
        things, and that's a bit worrying, because it seems like this question
        should be a timeless one. The answer shouldn't change much.<br /><br />I'm
        not too worried that the traditional answers don't mention taking care
        of the world. Obviously people only started to care about that once it
        became clear we could ruin it. But how can making good new things be
        important if the traditional answers don't mention it?<br /><br />The
        traditional answers were answers to a slightly different question. They
        were answers to the question of how to be, rather than what to do. The
        audience didn't have a lot of choice about what to do. The audience up
        till recent centuries was the landowning class, which was also the
        political class. They weren't choosing between doing physics and writing
        novels. Their work was foreordained: manage their estates, participate
        in politics, fight when necessary. It was ok to do certain other kinds
        of work in one's spare time, but ideally one didn't have any. Cicero's
        <i>De Officiis</i> is one of the great classical answers to the question
        of how to live, and in it he explicitly says that he wouldn't even be
        writing it if he hadn't been excluded from public life by recent
        political upheavals.

        ><br /><br />There were of course people doing what we would now call
        "original work," and they were often admired for it, but they weren't
        seen as models. Archimedes knew that he was the first to prove that a
        sphere has 2/3 the volume of the smallest enclosing cylinder and was
        very pleased about it. But you don't find ancient writers urging their
        readers to emulate him. They regarded him more as a prodigy than a
        model.<br /><br />Now many more of us can follow Archimedes's example
        and devote most of our attention to one kind of work. He turned out to
        be a model after all, along with a collection of other people that his
        contemporaries would have found it strange to treat as a distinct group,
        because the vein of people making new things ran at right angles to the
        social hierarchy.<br /><br />What kinds of new things count? I'd rather
        leave that question to the makers of them. It would be a risky business
        to try to define any kind of threshold, because new kinds of work are
        often despised at first. Raymond Chandler was writing literal pulp
        fiction, and he's now recognized as one of the best writers of the
        twentieth century. Indeed this pattern is so common that you can use it
        as a recipe: if you're excited about some kind of work that's not
        considered prestigious and you can explain what everyone else is
        overlooking about it, then this is not merely a kind of work that's ok
        to do, but one to seek out.<br /><br />The other reason I wouldn't want
        to define any thresholds is that we don't need them. The kind of people
        who make good new things don't need rules to keep them honest.<br /><br />So
        there's my guess at a set of principles to live by: take care of people
        and the world, and make good new things. Different people will do these
        to varying degrees. There will presumably be lots who focus entirely on
        taking care of people. There will be a few who focus mostly on making
        new things. But even if you're one of those, you should at least make
        sure that the new things you make don't net <i>harm</i> people or the
        world. And if you go a step further and try to make things that help
        them, you may find you're ahead on the trade. You'll be more constrained
        in what you can make, but you'll make it with more energy.<br /><br />On
        the other hand, if you make something amazing, you'll often be helping
        people or the world even if you didn't mean to. Newton was driven by
        curiosity and ambition, not by any practical effect his work might have,
        and yet the practical effect of his work has been enormous. And this
        seems the rule rather than the exception. So if you think you can make
        something amazing, you should probably just go ahead and do it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b

        >] We could treat all three as the same kind of should by saying that
        it's one's duty to live well â€” for example by saying, as some Christians
        have, that it's one's duty to make the most of one's God-given gifts.
        But this seems one of those casuistries people invented to evade the
        stern requirements of religion: it was permissible to spend time
        studying math instead of praying or performing acts of charity because
        otherwise you were rejecting a gift God had given you. A useful
        casuistry no doubt, but we don't need it.<br /><br />We could also
        combine the first two principles, since people are part of the world.
        Why should our species get special treatment? I won't try to justify
        this choice, but I'm skeptical that anyone who claims to think
        differently actually lives according to their principles.<br /><br />[<a

        losing end of a power struggle, and presumably he too would not be so
        famous now if it hadn't been for this long stretch of enforced
        leisure.<br /><br /><br /><br /><font color="888888"
