        <br /><br />January 2017<br /><br />People who are powerful but
        uncharismatic will tend to be disliked. Their power makes them a target
        for criticism that they don't have the charisma to disarm. That was
        Hillary Clinton's problem. It also tends to be a problem for any CEO who
        is more of a builder than a schmoozer. And yet the builder-type CEO is
        (like Hillary) probably the best person for the job.<br /><br />I don't
        think there is any solution to this problem. It's human nature. The best
        we can do is to recognize that it's happening, and to understand that
        being a magnet for criticism is sometimes a sign not that someone is the
        wrong person for a job, but that they're the right one.<br /><br />
