            >(I wrote this article to help myself understand exactly what
            McCarthy discovered. You don't need to know this stuff to program in
            Lisp, but it should be helpful to anyone who wants to understand the
            essence of Lisp � both in the sense of its origins and its semantic
            core. The fact that it has such a core is one of Lisp's
            distinguishing features, and the reason why, unlike other languages,
            Lisp has dialects.)</i
          ><br /><br />In 1960,
          <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/index.html"
            >John McCarthy</a
          >
          published a remarkable paper in which he did for programming something
          like what Euclid did for geometry. He showed how, given a handful of
          simple operators and a notation for functions, you can build a whole
          programming language. He called this language Lisp, for "List
          Processing," because one of his key ideas was to use a simple data
          structure called a <i>list</i> for both code and data.<br /><br />It's
          worth understanding what McCarthy discovered, not just as a landmark
          in the history of computers, but as a model for what programming is
          tending to become in our own time. It seems to me that there have been
          two really clean, consistent models of programming so far: the C model
          and the Lisp model. These two seem points of high ground, with swampy
          lowlands between them. As computers have grown more powerful, the new
          languages being developed have been
          <a href="diff.html">moving steadily</a> toward the Lisp model. A
          popular recipe for new programming languages in the past 20 years has
          been to take the C model of computing and add to it, piecemeal, parts
          taken from the Lisp model, like runtime typing and garbage
          collection.<br /><br />In this article I'm going to try to explain in
          the simplest possible terms what McCarthy discovered. The point is not
          just to learn about an interesting theoretical result someone figured
          out forty years ago, but to show where languages are heading. The
          unusual thing about Lisp � in fact, the defining quality of Lisp � is
          that it can be written in itself. To understand what McCarthy meant by
          this, we're going to retrace his steps, with his mathematical notation
          translated into running Common Lisp code.<br /><br /><br
