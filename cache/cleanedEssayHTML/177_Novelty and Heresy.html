        <br /><br />November 2019<br /><br />If you discover something new,
        there's a significant chance you'll be accused of some form of
        heresy.<br /><br />To discover new things, you have to work on ideas
        that are good but non-obvious; if an idea is obviously good, other
        people are probably already working on it. One common way for a good
        idea to be non-obvious is for it to be hidden in the shadow of some
        mistaken assumption that people are very attached to. But anything you
        discover from working on such an idea will tend to contradict the
        mistaken assumption that was concealing it. And you will thus get a lot
        of heat from people attached to the mistaken assumption. Galileo and
        Darwin are famous examples of this phenomenon, but it's probably always
        an ingredient in the resistance to new ideas.<br /><br />So it's
        particularly dangerous for an organization or society to have a culture
        of pouncing on heresy. When you suppress heresies, you don't just
        prevent people from contradicting the mistaken assumption you're trying
        to protect. You also suppress any idea that implies indirectly that it's
        false.
        <!--
When you suppress heresy, you silence not just your opponents but
also everyone who contradicts you unintentionally.  And because
ideas are so interconnected, you're almost certainly silencing more
people than you realize. 
--><br /><br />Every cherished mistaken assumption has a dead zone of unexplored
        ideas around it. And the more preposterous the assumption, the bigger
        the dead zone it creates.<br /><br />There is a positive side to this
        phenomenon though. If you're looking for new ideas, one way to find them
        is by <a href="say.html"><u>looking for heresies</u></a
        >. When you look at the question this way, the depressingly large dead
        zones around mistaken assumptions become excitingly large mines of new
        ideas.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
