          recently that the reason there aren't more Googles is that most
          startups get bought before they can change the world.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Google, despite serious interest from Microsoft and Yahoo—what must
          have seemed like lucrative interest at the time—didn't sell out.
          Google might simply have been nothing but Yahoo's or MSN's search
          box.<br /><br />Why isn't it? Because Google had a deeply felt sense
          of purpose: a conviction to change the world for the better.
        </blockquote>
        This has a nice sound to it, but it isn't true. Google's founders were
        willing to sell early on. They just wanted more than acquirers were
        willing to pay.<br /><br />It was the same with Facebook. They would
        have sold, but Yahoo blew it by offering too little.<br /><br />Tip for
        acquirers: when a startup turns you down, consider raising your offer,
        because there's a good chance the outrageous price they want will later
        seem a bargain.

        ><br /><br />From the evidence I've seen so far, startups that turn down
        acquisition offers usually end up doing better. Not always, but usually
        there's a bigger offer coming, or perhaps even an IPO.<br /><br />Of
        course, the reason startups do better when they turn down acquisition
        offers is not necessarily that all such offers undervalue startups. More
        likely the reason is that the kind of founders who have the balls to
        turn down a big offer also tend to be very successful. That spirit is
        exactly what you want in a startup.<br /><br />While I'm sure Larry and
        Sergey do want to change the world, at least now, the reason Google
        survived to become a big, independent company is the same reason
        Facebook has so far remained independent: acquirers underestimated
        them.<br /><br />Corporate M&amp;A is a strange business in that
        respect. They consistently lose the best deals, because turning down
        reasonable offers is the most reliable test you could invent for whether
        a startup will make it big.<br /><br /><b>VCs</b><br /><br />So what's
        the real reason there aren't more Googles? Curiously enough, it's the
        same reason Google and Facebook have remained independent: money guys
        undervalue the most innovative startups.<br /><br />The reason there
        aren't more Googles is not that investors encourage innovative startups
        to sell out, but that they won't even fund them. I've learned a lot
        about VCs during the 3 years we've been doing Y Combinator, because we
        often have to work quite closely with them. The most surprising thing
        I've learned is how conservative they are. VC firms present an image of
        boldly encouraging innovation. Only a handful actually do, and even they
        are more conservative in reality than you'd guess from reading their
        sites.<br /><br />I used to think of VCs as piratical: bold but
        unscrupulous. On closer acquaintance they turn out to be more like
        bureaucrats. They're more upstanding than I used to think (the good
        ones, at least), but less bold. Maybe the VC industry has changed. Maybe
        they used to be bolder. But I suspect it's the startup world that has
        changed, not them. The low cost of starting a startup means the average
        good bet is a riskier one, but most existing VC firms still operate as
        if they were investing in hardware startups in 1985.<br /><br />Howard
        Aiken said "Don't worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas
        are any good, you'll have to ram them down people's throats." I have a
        similar feeling when I'm trying to convince VCs to invest in startups Y
        Combinator has funded. They're terrified of really novel ideas, unless
        the founders are good enough salesmen to compensate.<br /><br />But it's
        the bold ideas that generate the biggest returns. Any really good new
        idea will seem bad to most people; otherwise someone would already be
        doing it. And yet most VCs are driven by consensus, not just within
        their firms, but within the VC community. The biggest factor determining
        how a VC will feel about your startup is how other VCs feel about it. I
        doubt they realize it, but this algorithm guarantees they'll miss all
        the very best ideas. The more people who have to like a new idea, the
        more outliers you lose.<br /><br />Whoever the next Google is, they're
        probably being told right now by VCs to come back when they have more
        "traction."<br /><br />Why are VCs so conservative? It's probably a
        combination of factors. The large size of their investments makes them
        conservative. Plus they're investing other people's money, which makes
        them worry they'll get in trouble if they do something risky and it
        fails. Plus most of them are money guys rather than technical guys, so
        they don't understand what the startups they're investing in do.<br /><br /><a

        ><br /><br />The exciting thing about market economies is that stupidity
        equals opportunity. And so it is in this case. There is a huge,
        unexploited opportunity in startup investing. Y Combinator funds
        startups at the very beginning. VCs will fund them once they're already
        starting to succeed. But between the two there is a substantial gap.<br /><br />There
        are companies that will give $20k to a startup that has nothing more
        than the founders, and there are companies that will give $2 million to
        a startup that's already taking off, but there aren't enough investors
        who will give $200k to a startup that seems very promising but still has
        some things to figure out. This territory is occupied mostly by
        individual angel investors—people like Andy Bechtolsheim, who gave
        Google $100k when they seemed promising but still had some things to
        figure out. I like angels, but there just aren't enough of them, and
        investing is for most of them a part time job.<br /><br />And yet as it
        gets cheaper to start startups, this sparsely occupied territory is
        becoming more and more valuable. Nowadays a lot of startups don't want
        to raise multi-million dollar series A rounds. They don't need that much
        money, and they don't want the hassles that come with it. The median
        startup coming out of Y Combinator wants to raise $250-500k. When they
        go to VC firms they have to ask for more because they know VCs aren't
        interested in such small deals.<br /><br />VCs are money managers.
        They're looking for ways to put large sums to work. But the startup
        world is evolving away from their current model.<br /><br />Startups
        have gotten cheaper. That means they want less money, but also that
        there are more of them. So you can still get large returns on large
        amounts of money; you just have to spread it more broadly.<br /><br />I've
        tried to explain this to VC firms. Instead of making one $2 million
        investment, make five $400k investments. Would that mean sitting on too
        many boards? Don't sit on their boards. Would that mean too much due
        diligence? Do less. If you're investing at a tenth the valuation, you
        only have to be a tenth as sure.<br /><br />It seems obvious. But I've
        proposed to several VC firms that they set aside some money and
        designate one partner to make more, smaller bets, and they react as if
        I'd proposed the partners all get nose rings. It's remarkable how wedded
        they are to their standard m.o.<br /><br />But there is a big
        opportunity here, and one way or the other it's going to get filled.
        Either VCs will evolve down into this gap or, more likely, new investors
        will appear to fill it. That will be a good thing when it happens,
        because these new investors will be compelled by the structure of the
        investments they make to be ten times bolder than present day VCs. And
        that will get us a lot more Googles. At least, as long as acquirers
        remain stupid.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        <b>Notes</b><br /><br />[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a
        >] Another tip: If you want to get all that value, don't destroy the
        startup after you buy it. Give the founders enough autonomy that they
        can grow the acquisition into what it would have become.<br /><br /><b
