          March 2009<br /><br />A couple days ago I finally got being a good
          startup founder down to two words: relentlessly resourceful.<br /><br />Till
          then the best I'd managed was to get the opposite quality down to one:
          hapless. Most dictionaries say hapless means unlucky. But the
          dictionaries are not doing a very good job. A team that outplays its
          opponents but loses because of a bad decision by the referee could be
          called unlucky, but not hapless. Hapless implies passivity. To be
          hapless is to be battered by circumstances â€” to let the world have its
          way with you, instead of having your way with the world.
          <!--Unlucky is a bad synonym, because it emphasizes the role of chance
in bad outcomes.  Hapless overlaps more with the other component
of bad outcomes, the half that makes them deserved. -->

            >[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a
            >]</font
          ><br /><br />Unfortunately there's no antonym of hapless, which makes
          it difficult to tell founders what to aim for. "Don't be hapless" is
          not much of a rallying cry.<br /><br />It's not hard to express the
          quality we're looking for in metaphors. The best is probably a running
          back. A good running back is not merely determined, but flexible as
          well. They want to get downfield, but they adapt their plans on the
          fly.<br /><br />Unfortunately this is just a metaphor, and not a
          useful one to most people outside the US. "Be like a running back" is
          no better than "Don't be hapless."<br /><br />But finally I've figured
          out how to express this quality directly. I was writing a talk for
          <a href="angelinvesting.html">investors</a>, and I had to explain what
          to look for in founders. What would someone who was the opposite of
          hapless be like? They'd be relentlessly resourceful. Not merely
          relentless. That's not enough to make things go your way except in a
          few mostly uninteresting domains. In any interesting domain, the
          difficulties will be novel. Which means you can't simply plow through
          them, because you don't know initially how hard they are; you don't
          know whether you're about to plow through a block of foam or granite.
          So you have to be resourceful. You have to keep trying new things.<br /><br />Be
          relentlessly resourceful.<br /><br />That sounds right, but is it
          simply a description of how to be successful in general? I don't think
          so. This isn't the recipe for success in writing or painting, for
          example. In that kind of work the recipe is more to be actively
          curious. Resourceful implies the obstacles are external, which they
          generally are in startups. But in writing and painting they're mostly
          internal; the obstacle is your own obtuseness.

          ><br /><br />There probably are other fields where "relentlessly
          resourceful" is the recipe for success. But though other fields may
          share it, I think this is the best short description we'll find of
          what makes a good startup founder. I doubt it could be made more
          precise.<br /><br />Now that we know what we're looking for, that
          leads to other questions. For example, can this quality be taught?
          After four years of trying to teach it to people, I'd say that yes,
          surprisingly often it can. Not to everyone, but to many people.

          Some people are just constitutionally passive, but others have a
          latent ability to be relentlessly resourceful that only needs to be
          brought out.<br /><br />This is particularly true of young people who
          have till now always been under the thumb of some kind of authority.
          Being relentlessly resourceful is definitely not the recipe for
          success in big companies, or in most schools. I don't even want to
          think what the recipe is in big companies, but it is certainly longer
          and messier, involving some combination of resourcefulness, obedience,
          and building alliances.<br /><br />Identifying this quality also
          brings us closer to answering a question people often wonder about:
          how many startups there could be. There is not, as some people seem to
          think, any economic upper bound on this number. There's no reason to
          believe there is any limit on the amount of newly created wealth
          consumers can absorb, any more than there is a limit on the number of
          theorems that can be proven. So probably the limiting factor on the
          number of startups is the pool of potential founders. Some people
          would make good founders, and others wouldn't. And now that we can say
          what makes a good founder, we know how to put an upper bound on the
          size of the pool.<br /><br />This test is also useful to individuals.
          If you want to know whether you're the right sort of person to start a
          startup, ask yourself whether you're relentlessly resourceful. And if
          you want to know whether to recruit someone as a cofounder, ask if
          they are.<br /><br />You can even use it tactically. If I were running
          a startup, this would be the phrase I'd tape to the mirror. "Make
          something people want" is the destination, but "Be relentlessly
          resourceful" is how you get there.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

          >] I think the reason the dictionaries are wrong is that the meaning
          of the word has shifted. No one writing a dictionary from scratch
          today would say that hapless meant unlucky. But a couple hundred years
          ago they might have. People were more at the mercy of circumstances in
          the past, and as a result a lot of the words we use for good and bad
          outcomes have origins in words about luck.<br /><br />When I was
          living in Italy, I was once trying to tell someone that I hadn't had
          much success in doing something, but I couldn't think of the Italian
          word for success. I spent some time trying to describe the word I
          meant. Finally she said "Ah! Fortuna!"<br /><br />[<a name="f2n"

          >] There are aspects of startups where the recipe is to be actively
          curious. There can be times when what you're doing is almost pure
          discovery. Unfortunately these times are a small proportion of the
          whole. On the other hand, they are in research too.<br /><br />[<a
            name="f3n"
            ><font color="#000000">3</font></a
          >] I'd almost say to most people, but I realize (a) I have no idea
          what most people are like, and (b) I'm pathologically optimistic about
          people's ability to change.<br /><br /><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor
