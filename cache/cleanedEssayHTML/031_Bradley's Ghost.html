        ><br /><br /><br /><br />November 2004<br /><br /><!--<i>(I wrote this essay immediately after the election.
But after writing it I buried it; I was so
depressed about the election that I just didn't want to think
about it anymore.
I recently came across this essay again, and it
strikes me as on the mark.)</i>

        A lot of people are writing now about why Kerry lost. Here I want to
        examine a more specific question: why were the exit polls so wrong?<br /><br />In
        Ohio, which Kerry ultimately lost 49-51, exit polls gave him a 52-48
        victory. And this wasn't just random error. In every swing state they
        overestimated the Kerry vote. In Florida, which Bush ultimately won
        52-47, exit polls predicted a dead heat.<br /><br />(These are not early
        numbers. They're from about midnight eastern time, long after polls
        closed in Ohio and Florida. And yet by the next afternoon the exit poll
        numbers online corresponded to the returns. The only way I can imagine
        this happening is if those in charge of the exit polls cooked the books
        after seeing the actual returns. But that's another issue.)<br /><br />What
        happened? The source of the problem may be a variant of the Bradley
        Effect. This term was invented after Tom Bradley, the black mayor of Los
        Angeles, lost an election for governor of California despite a
        comfortable lead in the polls. Apparently voters were afraid to say they
        planned to vote against him, lest their motives be (perhaps correctly)
        suspected.<br /><br />It seems likely that something similar happened in
        exit polls this year. In theory, exit polls ought to be very accurate.
        You're not asking people what they would do. You're asking what they
        just did.<br /><br />How can you get errors asking that? Because some
        people don't respond. To get a truly random sample, pollsters ask, say,
        every 20th person leaving the polling place who they voted for. But not
        everyone wants to answer. And the pollsters can't simply ignore those
        who won't, or their sample isn't random anymore. So what they do,
        apparently, is note down the age and race and sex of the person, and
        guess from that who they voted for.<br /><br />This works so long as
        there is no <i>correlation</i> between who people vote for and whether
        they're willing to talk about it. But this year there may have been. It
        may be that a significant number of those who voted for Bush didn't want
        to say so.<br /><br />Why not? Because people in the US are more
        conservative than they're willing to admit. The values of the elite in
        this country, at least at the moment, are NPR values. The average
        person, as I think both Republicans and Democrats would agree, is more
        socially conservative. But while some openly flaunt the fact that they
        don't share the opinions of the elite, others feel a little nervous
        about it, as if they had bad table manners.<br /><br />For example,
        according to current NPR values, you
        <a href="say.html">can't say</a> anything that might be perceived as
        disparaging towards homosexuals. To do so is "homophobic." And yet a
        large number of Americans are deeply religious, and the Bible is quite
        explicit on the subject of homosexuality. What are they to do? I think
        what many do is keep their opinions, but keep them to themselves.<br /><br />They
        know what they believe, but they also know what they're supposed to
        believe. And so when a stranger (for example, a pollster) asks them
        their opinion about something like gay marriage, they will not always
        say what they really think.<br /><br />When the values of the elite are
        liberal, polls will tend to underestimate the conservativeness of
        ordinary voters. This seems to me the leading theory to explain why the
        exit polls were so far off this year. NPR values said one ought to vote
        for Kerry. So all the people who voted for Kerry felt virtuous for doing
        so, and were eager to tell pollsters they had. No one who voted for
        Kerry did it as an act of quiet defiance.<br /><br /><!-- Imagine this scenario.  A husband and wife go to vote.  The wife
thinks Bush has made a mess in Iraq and that the family is worse   
off economically than a few years ago, and plans to vote for Kerry.
The husband thinks it's
great that America is finally kicking some ass, and sees in George
Bush a kind of cowboy figure that he likes to identify with.  Which
of the two is more likely to want to explain to a pollster why they
voted as they did?<br /><br />--><br /><br /><br clear="all" />
