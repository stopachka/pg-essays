        <br /><br />November 2022<br /><br />Since I was about 9 I've been
        puzzled by the apparent contradiction between being made of matter that
        behaves in a predictable way, and the feeling that I could choose to do
        whatever I wanted. At the time I had a self-interested motive for
        exploring the question. At that age (like most succeeding ages) I was
        always in trouble with the authorities, and it seemed to me that there
        might possibly be some way to get out of trouble by arguing that I
        wasn't responsible for my actions. I gradually lost hope of that, but
        the puzzle remained: How do you reconcile being a machine made of matter
        with the feeling that you're free to choose what you do?

        ><br /><br />The best way to explain the answer may be to start with a
        slightly wrong version, and then fix it. The wrong version is: You can
        do what you want, but you can't want what you want. Yes, you can control
        what you do, but you'll do what you want, and you can't control that.<br /><br />The
        reason this is mistaken is that people do sometimes change what they
        want. People who don't want to want something — drug addicts, for
        example — can sometimes make themselves stop wanting it. And people who
        want to want something — who want to like classical music, or broccoli —
        sometimes succeed.<br /><br />So we modify our initial statement: You
        can do what you want, but you can't want to want what you want.<br /><br />That's
        still not quite true. It's possible to change what you want to want. I
        can imagine someone saying "I decided to stop wanting to like classical
        music." But we're getting closer to the truth. It's rare for people to
        change what they want to want, and the more "want to"s we add, the rarer
        it gets.<br /><br />We can get arbitrarily close to a true statement by
        adding more "want to"s in much the same way we can get arbitrarily close
        to 1 by adding more 9s to a string of 9s following a decimal point. In
        practice three or four "want to"s must surely be enough. It's hard even
        to envision what it would mean to change what you want to want to want
        to want, let alone actually do it.<br /><br />So one way to express the
        correct answer is to use a regular expression. You can do what you want,
        but there's some statement of the form "you can't (want to)* want what
        you want" that's true. Ultimately you get back to a want that you don't
        control.

        <b>Notes</b><br /><br />[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a
        >] I didn't know when I was 9 that matter might behave randomly, but I
        don't think it affects the problem much. Randomness destroys the ghost
        in the machine as effectively as determinism.<br /><br />[<a name="f2n"
          ><font color="#000000">2</font></a
        >] If you don't like using an expression, you can make the same point
        using higher-order desires: There is some n such that you don't control
        your nth-order desires.<br /><br /><br /><br />
