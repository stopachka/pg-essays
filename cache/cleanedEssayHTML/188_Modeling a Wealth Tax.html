        <br /><br />August 2020<br /><br />Some politicians are proposing to
        introduce wealth taxes in addition to income and capital gains taxes.
        Let's try modeling the effects of various levels of wealth tax to see
        what they would mean in practice for a startup founder.<br /><br />Suppose
        you start a successful startup in your twenties, and then live for
        another 60 years. How much of your stock will a wealth tax consume?<br /><br />If
        the wealth tax applies to all your assets, it's easy to calculate its
        effect. A wealth tax of 1% means you get to keep 99% of your stock each
        year. After 60 years the proportion of stock you'll have left will be
        .99^60, or .547. So a straight 1% wealth tax means the government will
        over the course of your life take 45% of your stock.<br /><br />(Losing
        shares does not, obviously, mean becoming <i>net</i> poorer unless the
        value per share is increasing by less than the wealth tax rate.)<br /><br />Here's
        how much stock the government would take over 60 years at various levels
        of wealth tax:<br /><br />

        A wealth tax will usually have a threshold at which it starts. How much
        difference would a high threshold make? To model that, we need to make
        some assumptions about the initial value of your stock and the growth
        rate.<br /><br />Suppose your stock is initially worth $2 million, and
        the company's trajectory is as follows: the value of your stock grows 3x
        for 2 years, then 2x for 2 years, then 50% for 2 years, after which you
        just get a typical public company growth rate, which we'll call 8%.

        It may at first seem surprising that such apparently small tax rates
        produce such dramatic effects. A 2% wealth tax with a $50&nbsp;million
        threshold takes about two thirds of a successful founder's stock.<br /><br />The
        reason wealth taxes have such dramatic effects is that they're applied
        over and over to the same money. Income tax happens every year, but only
        to that year's income. Whereas if you live for 60 years after acquiring
        some asset, a wealth tax will tax that same asset 60 times. A wealth tax
        compounds.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Note</b
        ><br /><br />[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a
        >] In practice, eventually some of this 8% would come in the form of
        dividends, which are taxed as income at issue, so this model actually
        represents the most optimistic case for the founder.<br /><br />
