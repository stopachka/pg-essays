<div><div><div></div><div></div><div><br><br><div><br><br>November 2022<br><br>In the science fiction books I read as a kid, reading had often
been replaced by some more efficient way of acquiring knowledge.
Mysterious "tapes" would load it into one's brain like a program
being loaded into a computer.<br><br>That sort of thing is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Not just
because it would be hard to build a replacement for reading, but
because even if one existed, it would be insufficient. Reading about
x doesn't just teach you about x; it also teaches you how to write.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Would that matter? If we replaced reading, would anyone need to be
good at writing?<br><br>The reason it would matter is that writing is not just a way to
convey ideas, but also a way to have them.<br><br>A good writer doesn't just think, and then write down what he
thought, as a sort of transcript. A good writer will almost always
discover new things in the process of writing. And there is, as far
as I know, no substitute for this kind of discovery. Talking about
your ideas with other people is a good way to develop them. But
even after doing this, you'll find you still discover new things
when you sit down to write. There is a kind of thinking that can
only be done by <a href="words.html"><u>writing</u></a>.<br><br>There are of course kinds of thinking that can be done without
writing. If you don't need to go too deeply into a problem, you can
solve it without writing. If you're thinking about how two pieces
of machinery should fit together, writing about it probably won't
help much. And when a problem can be described formally, you can
sometimes solve it in your head. But if you need to solve a
complicated, ill-defined problem, it will almost always help to
write about it. Which in turn means that someone who's not good at
writing will almost always be at a disadvantage in solving such
problems.<br><br>You can't think well without writing well, and you can't write well
without reading well. And I mean that last "well" in both senses.
You have to be good at reading, and read good things.

But people who want to have ideas can't afford to.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Audiobooks can give you examples of good writing, but having
them read to you doesn't teach you as much about writing as reading
them yourself.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
By "good at reading" I don't mean good at the mechanics of
reading. You don't have to be good at extracting words from the
page so much as extracting meaning from the words.<br><br></div><div></div><div></div><br><div></div><div><img src="../assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620_how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><a href="https://practical-scheme.net/trans/read-j.html">Japanese Translation</a><br></div><div></div><div><img src="../assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620_how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><a href="https://catcoding.me/p/read/">Chinese Translation</a><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><img src="../assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620_how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><a href="https://marcotrombetti.com/leggere">Italian Translation</a><br></div><div></div><div><img src="../assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620_how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><a href="https://dorianmarie.fr/paulgraham/lire.html">French Translation</a><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><br><br></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>
