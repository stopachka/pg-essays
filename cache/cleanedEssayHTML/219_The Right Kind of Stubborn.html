        <br /><br />July 2024<br /><br />Successful people tend to be
        persistent. New ideas often don't work at first, but they're not
        deterred. They keep trying and eventually find something that does.<br /><br />Mere
        obstinacy, on the other hand, is a recipe for failure. Obstinate people
        are so annoying. They won't listen. They beat their heads against a wall
        and get nowhere.<br /><br />But is there any real difference between
        these two cases? Are persistent and obstinate people actually behaving
        differently? Or are they doing the same thing, and we just label them
        later as persistent or obstinate depending on whether they turned out to
        be right or not?<br /><br />If that's the only difference then there's
        nothing to be learned from the distinction. Telling someone to be
        persistent rather than obstinate would just be telling them to be right
        rather than wrong, and they already know that. Whereas if persistence
        and obstinacy are actually different kinds of behavior, it would be
        worthwhile to tease them apart.

        ><br /><br />I've talked to a lot of determined people, and it seems to
        me that they're different kinds of behavior. I've often walked away from
        a conversation thinking either "Wow, that guy is determined" or "Damn,
        that guy is stubborn," and I don't think I'm just talking about whether
        they seemed right or not. That's part of it, but not all of it.<br /><br />There's
        something annoying about the obstinate that's not simply due to being
        mistaken. They won't listen. And that's not true of all determined
        people. I can't think of anyone more determined than the Collison
        brothers, and when you point out a problem to them, they not only
        listen, but listen with an almost predatory intensity. Is there a hole
        in the bottom of their boat? Probably not, but if there is, they want to
        know about it.<br /><br />It's the same with most successful people.
        They're never <i>more</i>
        engaged than when you disagree with them. Whereas the obstinate don't
        want to hear you. When you point out problems, their eyes glaze over,
        and their replies sound like ideologues talking about matters of
        doctrine.

        ><br /><br />The reason the persistent and the obstinate seem similar is
        that they're both hard to stop. But they're hard to stop in different
        senses. The persistent are like boats whose engines can't be throttled
        back. The obstinate are like boats whose rudders can't be turned.

          >[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a
          >]</font
        ><br /><br />In the degenerate case they're indistinguishable: when
        there's only one way to solve a problem, your only choice is whether to
        give up or not, and persistence and obstinacy both say no. This is
        presumably why the two are so often conflated in popular culture. It
        assumes simple problems. But as problems get more complicated, we can
        see the difference between them. The persistent are much more attached
        to points high in the decision tree than to minor ones lower down, while
        the obstinate spray "don't give up" indiscriminately over the whole
        tree.<br /><br />The persistent are attached to the goal. The obstinate
        are attached to their ideas about how to reach it.<br /><br />Worse
        still, that means they'll tend to be attached to their
        <i>first</i> ideas about how to solve a problem, even though these are
        the least informed by the experience of working on it. So the obstinate
        aren't merely attached to details, but disproportionately likely to be
        attached to wrong ones.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why are they like this?
        Why are the obstinate obstinate? One possibility is that they're
        overwhelmed. They're not very capable. They take on a hard problem.
        They're immediately in over their head. So they grab onto ideas the way
        someone on the deck of a rolling ship might grab onto the nearest
        handhold.<br /><br />That was my initial theory, but on examination it
        doesn't hold up. If being obstinate were simply a consequence of being
        in over one's head, you could make persistent people become obstinate by
        making them solve harder problems. But that's not what happens. If you
        handed the Collisons an extremely hard problem to solve, they wouldn't
        become obstinate. If anything they'd become less obstinate. They'd know
        they had to be open to anything.<br /><br />Similarly, if obstinacy were
        caused by the situation, the obstinate would stop being obstinate when
        solving easier problems. But they don't. And if obstinacy isn't caused
        by the situation, it must come from within. It must be a feature of
        one's personality.<br /><br />Obstinacy is a reflexive resistance to
        changing one's ideas. This is not identical with stupidity, but they're
        closely related. A reflexive resistance to changing one's ideas becomes
        a sort of induced stupidity as contrary evidence mounts. And obstinacy
        is a form of not giving up that's easily practiced by the stupid. You
        don't have to consider complicated tradeoffs; you just dig in your
        heels. It even works, up to a point.<br /><br />The fact that obstinacy
        works for simple problems is an important clue. Persistence and
        obstinacy aren't opposites. The relationship between them is more like
        the relationship between the two kinds of respiration we can do: aerobic
        respiration, and the anaerobic respiration we inherited from our most
        distant ancestors. Anaerobic respiration is a more primitive process,
        but it has its uses. When you leap suddenly away from a threat, that's
        what you're using.<br /><br />The optimal amount of obstinacy is not
        zero. It can be good if your initial reaction to a setback is an
        unthinking "I won't give up," because this helps prevent panic. But
        unthinking only gets you so far. The further someone is toward the
        obstinate end of the continuum, the less likely they are to succeed in
        solving hard problems.

        ><br /><br /><br /><br />Obstinacy is a simple thing. Animals have it.
        But persistence turns out to have a fairly complicated internal
        structure.<br /><br />One thing that distinguishes the persistent is
        their energy. At the risk of putting too much weight on words, they
        persist rather than merely resisting. They keep trying things. Which
        means the persistent must also be imaginative. To keep trying things,
        you have to keep thinking of things to try.<br /><br />Energy and
        imagination make a wonderful combination. Each gets the best out of the
        other. Energy creates demand for the ideas produced by imagination,
        which thus produces more, and imagination gives energy somewhere to go.

          >]</font
        ><br /><br />Merely having energy and imagination is quite rare. But to
        solve hard problems you need three more qualities: resilience, good
        judgement, and a focus on some kind of goal.<br /><br />Resilience means
        not having one's morale destroyed by setbacks. Setbacks are inevitable
        once problems reach a certain size, so if you can't bounce back from
        them, you can only do good work on a small scale. But resilience is not
        the same as obstinacy. Resilience means setbacks can't change your
        morale, not that they can't change your mind.<br /><br />Indeed,
        persistence often requires that one change one's mind. That's where good
        judgement comes in. The persistent are quite rational. They focus on
        expected value. It's this, not recklessness, that lets them work on
        things that are unlikely to succeed.<br /><br />There is one point at
        which the persistent are often irrational though: at the very top of the
        decision tree. When they choose between two problems of roughly equal
        expected value, the choice usually comes down to personal preference.
        Indeed, they'll often classify projects into deliberately wide bands of
        expected value in order to ensure that the one they want to work on
        still qualifies.<br /><br />Empirically this doesn't seem to be a
        problem. It's ok to be irrational near the top of the decision tree. One
        reason is that we humans will work harder on a problem we love. But
        there's another more subtle factor involved as well: our preferences
        among problems aren't random. When we love a problem that other people
        don't, it's often because we've unconsciously noticed that it's more
        important than they realize.<br /><br />Which leads to our fifth
        quality: there needs to be some overall goal. If you're like me you
        began, as a kid, merely with the desire to do something great. In theory
        that should be the most powerful motivator of all, since it includes
        everything that could possibly be done. But in practice it's not much
        use, precisely because it includes too much. It doesn't tell you what to
        do at this moment.<br /><br />So in practice your energy and imagination
        and resilience and good judgement have to be directed toward some fairly
        specific goal. Not too specific, or you might miss a great discovery
        adjacent to what you're searching for, but not too general, or it won't
        work to motivate you.
        <font color="#dddddd"
          >[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#dddddd">6</font></a
          >]</font
        ><br /><br />When you look at the internal structure of persistence, it
        doesn't resemble obstinacy at all. It's so much more complex. Five
        distinct qualities — energy, imagination, resilience, good judgement,
        and focus on a goal — combine to produce a phenomenon that seems a bit
        like obstinacy in the sense that it causes you not to give up. But the
        way you don't give up is completely different. Instead of merely
        resisting change, you're driven toward a goal by energy and resilience,
        through paths discovered by imagination and optimized by judgement.
        You'll give way on any point low down in the decision tree, if its
        expected value drops sufficiently, but energy and resilience keep
        pushing you toward whatever you chose higher up.<br /><br />Considering
        what it's made of, it's not surprising that the right kind of
        stubbornness is so much rarer than the wrong kind, or that it gets so
        much better results. Anyone can do obstinacy. Indeed, kids and drunks
        and fools are best at it. Whereas very few people have enough of all
        five of the qualities that produce the right kind of stubbornness, but
        when they do the results are magical.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        <b>Notes</b><br /><br />[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a
        >] I'm going to use "persistent" for the good kind of stubborn and
        "obstinate" for the bad kind, but I can't claim I'm simply following
        current usage. Conventional opinion barely distinguishes between good
        and bad kinds of stubbornness, and usage is correspondingly promiscuous.
        I could have invented a new word for the good kind, but it seemed better
        just to stretch "persistent."<br /><br />[<a name="f2n"
          ><font color="#000000">2</font></a
        >] There are some domains where one can succeed by being obstinate. Some
        political leaders have been notorious for it. But it won't work in
        situations where you have to pass external tests. And indeed the
        political leaders who are famous for being obstinate are famous for
        getting power, not for using it well.<br /><br />[<a name="f3n"
          ><font color="#000000">3</font></a
        >] There will be some resistance to turning the rudder of a persistent
        person, because there's some cost to changing direction.<br /><br />[<a
          name="f4n"
          ><font color="#000000">4</font></a
        >] The obstinate do sometimes succeed in solving hard problems. One way
        is through luck: like the stopped clock that's right twice a day, they
        seize onto some arbitrary idea, and it turns out to be right. Another is
        when their obstinacy cancels out some other form of error. For example,
        if a leader has overcautious subordinates, their estimates of the
        probability of success will always be off in the same direction. So if
        he mindlessly says "push ahead regardless" in every borderline case,
        he'll usually turn out to be right.<br /><br />[<a name="f5n"
          ><font color="#000000">5</font></a
        >] If you stop there, at just energy and imagination, you get the
        conventional caricature of an artist or poet.<br /><br />[<a name="f6n"
          ><font color="#000000">6</font></a
        >] Start by erring on the small side. If you're inexperienced you'll
        inevitably err on one side or the other, and if you err on the side of
        making the goal too broad, you won't get anywhere. Whereas if you err on
        the small side you'll at least be moving forward. Then, once you're
        moving, you expand the goal.<br /><br /><br /><br /><font color="888888"
