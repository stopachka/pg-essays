<a href="http://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>.   VCs miss good startups all the time, but it's extraordinarily
rare for one to talk about it publicly till long afterward.  So
that post is further evidence what a rare bird Fred is.  He's
probably the nicest VC I know.<br /><br />Reading Fred's post made me go back and look at the emails I exchanged
with him at the time, trying to convince him to invest in Airbnb.
It was quite interesting to read.  You can see Fred's mind at work 
as he circles the deal.<br /><br />Fred and the Airbnb founders have generously agreed to let me publish
this email exchange (with one sentence redacted about something
that's strategically important to Airbnb and not an important part
of the conversation).  It's an interesting illustration of an element
of the startup ecosystem that few except the participants ever see:
investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio
companies.  Hundreds if not thousands of conversations of this type
are happening now, but if one has ever been published, I haven't
seen it.  The Airbnbs themselves never even saw these emails at the
time.<br /><br />We do a lot of this behind the scenes stuff at YC, because we invest
in such a large number of companies, and we invest so early that
investors sometimes need a lot of convincing to see their merits.
I don't always try as hard as this though.  Fred must 
have found me quite annoying.<br /><br /><br /><br /><hr>

subject: meet the airbeds<br /><br />One of the startups from the batch that just started, AirbedAndBreakfast,
is in NYC right now meeting their users.  (NYC is their biggest
market.) I'd recommend meeting them if your schedule allows.<br /><br />I'd been thinking to myself that though these guys were going to
do really well, I should introduce them to angels, because VCs would
never go for it.  But then I thought maybe I should give you more
credit.  You'll certainly like meeting them.  Be sure to ask about
how they funded themselves with breakfast cereal.<br /><br />There's no reason this couldn't be as big as Ebay.  And this team
is the right one to do it.<br /><br />--pg<br /><br /><br /><br />from: Brian Chesky

you guys, it would be Fred.  He is the least suburban-golf-playing
VC I know.<br /><br />He likes to observe startups for a while before acting, so don't
be bummed if he seems ambivalent.<br /><br />--pg<br /><br /><br /><br />from: Fred Wilson

airbed concept. We'll finish that debate tomorrow in our weekly
meeting and get back to you with our thoughts<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Fred<br /><br /><br /><br />from: Paul Graham

subject: Re: meet the airbeds<br /><br />Ideas can morph.  Practically every really big startup could say,
five years later, "believe it or not, we started out doing ___."
It just seemed a very good sign to me that these guys were actually
on the ground in NYC hunting down (and understanding) their users.
On top of several previous good signs.<br /><br />--pg<br /><br /><br /><br />from: Fred Wilson

their batch by a landslide.  In the past this has not been a 100%
indicator of success (if only anything were) but much better than
random.<br /><br />--pg<br /><br /><br /><br />from: Fred Wilson

subject: Re: airbnb<br /><br />Did they explain the long-term goal of being the market in accommodation
the way eBay is in stuff?  That seems like it would be huge.  Hotels
now are like airlines in the 1970s before they figured out how to
increase their load factors.<br /><br /><br /><br />from: Fred Wilson

subject: Re: airbnb<br /><br />They did but I am not sure I buy that<br /><br />ABNB reminds me of Etsy in that it facilitates real commerce in a
marketplace model directly between two people<br /><br />So I think it can scale all the way to the bed and breakfast market<br /><br />But I am not sure they can take on the hotel market<br /><br />I could be wrong<br /><br />But even so, if you include short term room rental, second home
rental, bed and breakfast, and other similar classes of accommodations,
you get to a pretty big opportunity<br /><br />fred<br /><br /><br /><br />from: Paul Graham

subject: Re: airbnb<br /><br />So invest in them!  They're very capital efficient.  They would
make an investor's money go a long way.<br /><br />It's also counter-cyclical.  They just arrived back from NYC, and
when I asked them what was the most significant thing they'd observed,
it was how many of their users actually needed to do these rentals
to pay their rents.<br /><br />--pg<br /><br /><br /><br />from: Fred Wilson

were investors in Service Metrics and understand this model<br /><br />I am also talking to my friend Mark Pincus who had an idea like
this a few years ago.<br /><br />So we are working on it<br /><br />Thanks for the lead<br /><br />Fred<br /><br /><br /><br />from: Paul Graham

subject: airbnb already spreading to pros<br /><br />I know you're skeptical they'll ever get hotels, but there's a
continuum between private sofas and hotel rooms, and they just moved
one step further along it.<br /><br />[link to an airbnb user]<br /><br />This is after only a few months.  I bet you they will get hotels
eventually.  It will start with small ones.  Just wait till all the
10-room pensiones in Rome discover this site.  And once it spreads
to hotels, where is the point (in size of chain) at which it stops?
Once something becomes a big marketplace, you ignore it at your
peril.<br /><br />--pg<br /><br /><br /><br />from: Fred Wilson

subject: Re: airbnb already spreading to pros<br /><br />That's true. It's also true that there are quite a few marketplaces
out there that serve this same market<br /><br />If you look at many of the people who list at ABNB, they list
elsewhere too<br /><br />I am not negative on this one, I am interested, but we are still
in the gathering data phase.<br /><br />fred
