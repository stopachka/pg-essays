<p align="justif">
<i>(This essay is from the introduction to </i><a href="onlisp.html">On Lisp</a>.<i>  The red text
explains the origins of <a href="arc.html">Arc</a>&apos;s name.)</i><br><br>It&apos;s a long-standing principle of programming style that the functional
elements of a program should not be too large.  If some component of a
program grows beyond the stage where it&apos;s readily comprehensible,
it becomes a mass of complexity which conceals errors as easily
as a big city conceals fugitives.  Such software will be
hard to read, hard to test, and hard to debug.<br><br>In accordance with this principle, a large program must be divided
into pieces, and the larger the program, the more it must be divided.
How do you divide a program?  The traditional approach is
called <i>top-down design:</i> you say &quot;the purpose of the
program is to do these seven things, so I divide it into seven major
subroutines.  The first subroutine has to do these four things, so
it in turn will have four of its own subroutines,&quot; and so on.
This process continues until the whole program has the right level
of granularity-- each part large enough to do something substantial,
but small enough to be understood as a single unit.<br><br>Experienced Lisp programmers divide up their programs differently.
As well as top-down design, they follow a principle which
could be called <i>bottom-up design</i>-- changing the language
to suit the problem.
In Lisp, you don&apos;t just write your program down toward the language,
you also build the language up toward your program.  As you&apos;re
writing a program you may think &quot;I wish Lisp had such-and-such an
operator.&quot; So you go and write it. Afterward
you realize that using the new operator would simplify the design  
of another part of the program, and so on.
Language and program evolve together.
Like the border between two warring states,
the boundary between language and program is drawn and redrawn,
until eventually it comes to rest along the mountains and rivers,
the natural frontiers of your problem.
In the end your program will look as if the language had been
designed for it.
And when language and
program fit one another well, you end up with code which is
clear, small, and efficient.<br><br><font color="#880000">
It&apos;s worth emphasizing that bottom-up design doesn&apos;t mean
just writing the same program in a different order.  When you
work bottom-up, you usually end up with a different program.
Instead of a single, monolithic program,
you will get a larger language with more abstract operators,   
and a smaller program written in it.  Instead of a lintel,
you&apos;ll get an arch.
</font><br><br>In typical code, once you abstract out the parts which are
merely bookkeeping, what&apos;s left is much shorter;
the higher you build up the language, the less distance you
will have to travel from the top down to it.
This brings several advantages:<br><br><ol>
<li> By making the language do more of the work, bottom-up design
yields programs which are smaller and more agile.  A shorter
program doesn&apos;t have to be divided into so many components, and
fewer components means programs which are easier to read or
modify.  Fewer components also means fewer connections between   
components, and thus less chance for errors there.  As
industrial designers strive to reduce the number of moving parts
in a machine, experienced Lisp programmers use bottom-up design
to reduce the size and complexity of their programs.<br><br></li><li> Bottom-up design promotes code re-use.
When you write two
or more programs, many of the utilities you wrote for the first
program will also be useful in the succeeding ones.  Once you&apos;ve  
acquired a large substrate of utilities, writing a new program can
take only a fraction of the effort it would require if you had to 
start with raw Lisp.<br><br></li><li> Bottom-up design makes programs easier to read.
<!--
%It yields the same result as top-down design
%with foresight---the foresight to arrange the branches near the
%root of the tree so that among the leaves there is as little
%duplication of effort as possible.
-->
An instance of this type
of abstraction asks the reader to understand a general-purpose operator;
an instance of functional abstraction asks the reader to understand
a special-purpose subroutine. [1]<br><br></li><li> Because it causes you always to be on the lookout for patterns
in your code, working bottom-up helps to clarify your ideas about
the design of your program.  If two distant components of a program
are similar in form, you&apos;ll be led to notice the similarity and
perhaps to redesign the program in a simpler way.
</li></ol>
</p><p align="justif">
Bottom-up design is possible to a certain degree in languages
other than Lisp.  Whenever you see library functions,
bottom-up design is happening.  However, Lisp gives you much broader
powers in this department, and augmenting the language plays a
proportionately larger role in Lisp style-- so much so that
Lisp is not just a different language, but a whole different way
of programming.<br><br>It&apos;s true that this style of development is better suited to
programs which can be written by small groups.  However, at the
same time, it extends the limits of what can be done by a small
group.  In <i>The Mythical Man-Month</i>,
Frederick Brooks
proposed that the productivity of a group of programmers
does not grow linearly with its size.  As the size of the
group increases, the productivity of individual programmers
goes down.  The experience of Lisp programming  
suggests a more cheerful way
to phrase this law: as the size of the group decreases, the
productivity of individual programmers goes up.
A small group wins, relatively speaking, simply because it&apos;s
smaller.  When a small group also takes advantage of the
techniques that Lisp makes possible, it can 
<a href="avg.html">win outright</a>.<br><br><br><br><b>New:</b> <a href="onlisptext.html">Download On Lisp for Free</a>.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
[1] &quot;But no one can read
the program without understanding all your new utilities.&quot;

April 2001, rev. April 2003<br><br><i>(This article is derived from a talk given at the 2001 Franz
Developer Symposium.)
</i><br><br>In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I
started a startup called 
<a href="http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release184.html">Viaweb</a>.  
Our plan was to write
software that would let end users build online stores.
What was novel about this software, at the time, was
that it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages
as the interface.<br><br>A lot of people could have been having this idea at the
same time, of course, but as far as I know, Viaweb was
the first Web-based application.  It seemed such
a novel idea to us that we named the company after it:
Viaweb, because our software worked via the Web,
instead of running on your desktop computer.<br><br>Another unusual thing about this software was that it
was written primarily in a programming language called
Lisp. It was one of the first big end-user
applications to be written in Lisp, which up till then
had been used mostly in universities and research labs. [1]<br><br><b>The Secret Weapon</b><br><br>Eric Raymond has written an essay called &quot;How to Become a Hacker,&quot;
and in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers what
languages they should learn.  He suggests starting with Python and
Java, because they are easy to learn.  The serious hacker will also
want to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for system
administration and cgi scripts.  Finally, the truly serious hacker
should consider learning Lisp:
<blockquote>
  Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience
  you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make
  you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you
  never actually use Lisp itself a lot.
</blockquote>
This is the same argument you tend to hear for learning Latin.  It
won&apos;t get you a job, except perhaps as a classics professor, but
it will improve your mind, and make you a better writer in languages
you do want to use, like English.<br><br>But wait a minute.  This metaphor doesn&apos;t stretch that far.  The
reason Latin won&apos;t get you a job is that no one speaks it.  If you
write in Latin, no one can understand you.  But Lisp is a computer
language, and computers speak whatever language you, the programmer,
tell them to.<br><br>So if Lisp makes you a better programmer, like he says, why wouldn&apos;t
you want to use it? If a painter were offered a brush that would
make him a better painter, it seems to me that he would want to
use it in all his paintings, wouldn&apos;t he? I&apos;m not trying to make
fun of Eric Raymond here.  On the whole, his advice is good.  What
he says about Lisp is pretty much the conventional wisdom.  But
there is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom:  Lisp will
make you a better programmer, and yet you won&apos;t use it.<br><br>Why not?  Programming languages are just tools, after all.  If Lisp
really does yield better programs, you should use it.  And if it
doesn&apos;t, then who needs it?<br><br>This is not just a theoretical question.  Software is a very
competitive business, prone to natural monopolies.  A company that
gets software written faster and better will, all other things
being equal, put its competitors out of business.  And when you&apos;re
starting a startup, you feel this very keenly.  Startups tend to
be an all or nothing proposition.  You either get rich, or you get
nothing.  In a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology, your
competitors will crush you.<br><br>Robert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn&apos;t see any reason
not to trust our instincts and go with Lisp.  We knew that everyone
else was writing their software in C++ or Perl.  But we also knew
that that didn&apos;t mean anything.  If you chose technology that way,
you&apos;d be running Windows.  When you choose technology, you have to
ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will
work the best.<br><br>This is especially true in a startup.  In a big company, you can
do what all the other big companies are doing.  But a startup can&apos;t
do what all the other startups do.  I don&apos;t think a lot of people
realize this, even in startups.<br><br>The average big company grows at about ten percent a year.  So if
you&apos;re running a big company and you do everything the way the
average big company does it, you can expect to do as well as the
average big company-- that is, to grow about ten percent a year.<br><br>The same thing will happen if you&apos;re running a startup, of course.
If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should
expect average performance.  The problem here is, average performance
means that you&apos;ll go out of business.  The survival rate for startups
is way less than fifty percent.  So if you&apos;re running a startup,
you had better be doing something odd.  If not, you&apos;re in trouble.<br><br>Back in 1995, we knew something that I don&apos;t think our competitors
understood, and few understand even now:  when you&apos;re writing
software that only has to run on your own servers, you can use
any language you want.  When you&apos;re writing desktop software,
there&apos;s a strong bias toward writing applications in the same
language as the operating system.  Ten years ago, writing applications
meant writing applications in C.  But with Web-based software,
especially when you have the source code of both the language and
the operating system, you can use whatever language you want.<br><br>This new freedom is a double-edged sword, however.  Now that you
can use any language, you have to think about which one to use.
Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that
their competitors do not.<br><br>If you can use any language, which do you use?  We chose Lisp.
For one thing, it was obvious that rapid development would be
important in this market.  We were all starting from scratch, so
a company that could get new features done before its competitors
would have a big advantage.  We knew Lisp was a really good language
for writing software quickly, and server-based applications magnify
the effect of rapid development, because you can release software
the minute it&apos;s done.<br><br>If other companies didn&apos;t want to use Lisp, so much the better.
It might give us a technological edge, and we needed all the help
we could get.  When we started Viaweb, we had no experience in
business.  We didn&apos;t know anything about marketing, or hiring
people, or raising money, or getting customers.  Neither of us had
ever even had what you would call a real job.  The only thing we
were good at was writing software.  We hoped that would save us.
Any advantage we could get in the software department, we would
take.<br><br>So you could say that using Lisp was an experiment.  Our hypothesis
was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we&apos;d be able to get
features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things
in our software that they couldn&apos;t do.  And because Lisp was so
high-level, we wouldn&apos;t need a big development team, so our costs
would be lower.  If this were so, we could offer a better product
for less money, and still make a profit.  We would end up getting
all the users, and our competitors would get none, and eventually
go out of business.  That was what we hoped would happen, anyway.<br><br>What were the results of this experiment?  Somewhat surprisingly,
it worked.  We eventually had many competitors, on the order of
twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete
with ours.  We had a wysiwyg online store builder that ran on the
server and yet felt like a desktop application.  Our competitors
had cgi scripts.  And we were always far ahead of them in features.
Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce
features that we didn&apos;t have.  But with Lisp our development cycle
was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within
a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release.  By
the time journalists covering the press release got round to calling
us, we would have the new feature too.<br><br>It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of
secret weapon-- that we were decoding their Enigma traffic or
something.  In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was simpler
than they realized.  No one was leaking news of their features to
us.   We were just able to develop software faster than anyone
thought possible.<br><br>When I was about nine I happened to get hold of a copy of <i>The Day
of the Jackal,</i> by Frederick Forsyth.  The main character is an
assassin who is hired to kill the president of France.  The assassin
has to get past the police to get up to an apartment that overlooks
the president&apos;s route.  He walks right by them, dressed up as an
old man on crutches, and they never suspect him.<br><br>Our secret weapon was similar.  We wrote our software in a weird
AI language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses.  For years
it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way.  But now it
worked to our advantage.  In business, there is nothing more valuable
than a technical advantage your competitors don&apos;t understand.  In
business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force.<br><br>And so, I&apos;m a little embarrassed to say, I never said anything
publicly about Lisp while we were working on Viaweb.  We never
mentioned it to the press, and if you searched for Lisp on our Web
site, all you&apos;d find were the titles of two books in my bio.  This
was no accident.  A startup should give its competitors as little
information as possible.  If they didn&apos;t know what language our
software was written in, or didn&apos;t care, I wanted to keep it that
way.[2]<br><br>The people who understood our technology best were the customers.
They didn&apos;t care what language Viaweb was written in either, but
they noticed that it worked really well.  It let them build great
looking online stores literally in minutes.  And so, by word of
mouth mostly, we got more and more users.  By the end of 1996 we
had about 70 stores online.  At the end of 1997 we had 500.  Six
months later, when Yahoo bought us, we had 1070 users.  Today, as
Yahoo Store, this software continues to dominate its market.  It&apos;s
one of the more profitable pieces of Yahoo, and the stores built
with it are the foundation of Yahoo Shopping.  I left Yahoo in
1999, so I don&apos;t know exactly how many users they have now, but
the last I heard there were about 20,000.<br><br><!-- People sometimes ask me if Yahoo Store still uses Lisp.  Yes, all
the Lisp code is still there.  Yahoo has server-side software
written in all five of the languages Eric Raymond recommends to
hackers.

<b>The Blub Paradox</b><br><br>What&apos;s so great about Lisp?  And if Lisp is so great, why doesn&apos;t
everyone use it?  These sound like rhetorical questions, but actually
they have straightforward answers.  Lisp is so great not because
of some magic quality visible only to devotees, but because it is
simply the most powerful language available.  And the reason everyone
doesn&apos;t use it is that programming languages are not merely
technologies, but habits of mind as well, and nothing changes
slower.  Of course, both these answers need explaining.<br><br>I&apos;ll begin with a shockingly controversial statement:  programming
languages vary in power.<br><br>Few would dispute, at least, that high level languages are more
powerful than machine language.  Most programmers today would agree
that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language.
Instead, you should program in a high-level language, and have a
compiler translate it into machine language for you.  This idea is
even built into the hardware now: since the 1980s, instruction sets
have been designed for compilers rather than human programmers.<br><br>Everyone knows it&apos;s a mistake to write your whole program by hand
in machine language.  What&apos;s less often understood is that there
is a more general principle here: that if you have a choice of
several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake
to program in anything but the most powerful one. [3]<br><br>There are many exceptions to this rule.  If you&apos;re writing a program
that has to work very closely with a program written in a certain
language, it might be a good idea to write the new program in the
same language.  If you&apos;re writing a program that only has to do
something very simple, like number crunching or bit manipulation,
you may as well use a less abstract language, especially since it
may be slightly faster.  And if you&apos;re writing a short, throwaway
program, you may be better off just using whatever language has
the best library functions for the task.  But in general, for
application software, you want to be using the most powerful
(reasonably efficient) language you can get, and using anything
else is a mistake, of exactly the same kind, though possibly in a
lesser degree, as programming in machine language.<br><br>You can see that machine language is very low level.  But, at least
as a kind of social convention, high-level languages are often all
treated as equivalent.  They&apos;re not.  Technically the term &quot;high-level
language&quot; doesn&apos;t mean anything very definite.  There&apos;s no dividing
line with machine languages on one side and all the high-level
languages on the other.  Languages fall along a continuum [4] of
abstractness, from the most powerful all the way down to machine
languages, which themselves vary in power.<br><br>Consider Cobol.  Cobol is a high-level language, in the sense that
it gets compiled into machine language.  Would anyone seriously
argue that Cobol is equivalent in power to, say, Python?  It&apos;s
probably closer to machine language than Python.<br><br>Or how about Perl 4?  Between Perl 4 and Perl 5, lexical closures
got added to the language.  Most Perl hackers would agree that Perl
5 is more powerful than Perl 4.  But once you&apos;ve admitted that,
you&apos;ve admitted that one high level language can be more powerful
than another.  And it follows inexorably that, except in special
cases, you ought to use the most powerful you can get.<br><br>This idea is rarely followed to its conclusion, though.  After a
certain age, programmers rarely switch languages voluntarily.
Whatever language people happen to be used to, they tend to consider
just good enough.<br><br>Programmers get very attached to their favorite languages, and I
don&apos;t want to hurt anyone&apos;s feelings, so to explain this point I&apos;m
going to use a hypothetical language called Blub.  Blub falls right
in the middle of the abstractness continuum.  It is not the most
powerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine
language.<br><br>And in fact, our hypothetical Blub programmer wouldn&apos;t use either
of them.  Of course he wouldn&apos;t program in machine language.  That&apos;s
what compilers are for.  And as for Cobol, he doesn&apos;t know how
anyone can get anything done with it.  It doesn&apos;t even have x (Blub
feature of your choice).<br><br>As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the
power continuum, he knows he&apos;s looking down.  Languages less powerful
than Blub are obviously less powerful, because they&apos;re missing some
feature he&apos;s used to.  But when our hypothetical Blub programmer
looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn&apos;t
realize he&apos;s looking up.  What he sees are merely weird languages.
He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but
with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well.  Blub is good
enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.<br><br>When we switch to the point of view of a programmer using any of
the languages higher up the power continuum, however, we find that
he in turn looks down upon Blub.  How can you get anything done in
Blub? It doesn&apos;t even have y.<br><br>By induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the
differences in power between the various languages are those who
understand the most powerful one.  (This is probably what Eric
Raymond meant about Lisp making you a better programmer.) You can&apos;t
trust the opinions of the others, because of the Blub paradox:
they&apos;re satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because
it dictates the way they think about programs.<br><br>I know this from my own experience, as a high school kid writing
programs in Basic.  That language didn&apos;t even support recursion.
It&apos;s hard to imagine writing programs without using recursion, but
I didn&apos;t miss it at the time.  I thought in Basic.  And I was a
whiz at it.  Master of all I surveyed.<br><br>The five languages that Eric Raymond recommends to hackers fall at
various points on the power continuum.  Where they fall relative
to one another is a sensitive topic.  What I will say is that I
think Lisp is at the top.  And to support this claim I&apos;ll tell you
about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other
four languages.  How can you get anything done in them, I think,
without macros? [5]<br><br>Many languages have something called a macro.  But Lisp macros are
unique.  And believe it or not, what they do is related to the
parentheses.  The designers of Lisp didn&apos;t put all those parentheses
in the language just to be different.  To the Blub programmer, Lisp
code looks weird.  But those parentheses are there for a reason.
They are the outward evidence of a fundamental difference between
Lisp and other languages.<br><br>Lisp code is made out of Lisp data objects.  And not in the trivial
sense that the source files contain characters, and strings are
one of the data types supported by the language.  Lisp code, after
it&apos;s read by the parser, is made of data structures that you can
traverse.<br><br>If you understand how compilers work, what&apos;s really going on is
not so much that Lisp has a strange syntax as that Lisp has no
syntax.  You write programs in the parse trees that get generated
within the compiler when other languages are parsed.  But these
parse trees are fully accessible to your programs.  You can write
programs that manipulate them.  In Lisp, these programs are called
macros.  They are programs that write programs.<br><br>Programs that write programs?  When would you ever want to do that?
Not very often, if you think in Cobol.  All the time, if you think
in Lisp.  It would be convenient here if I could give an example
of a powerful macro, and say there! how about that?  But if I did,
it would just look like gibberish to someone who didn&apos;t know Lisp;
there isn&apos;t room here to explain everything you&apos;d need to know to
understand what it meant.  In 
<a href="acl.html">Ansi Common Lisp</a> I tried to move
things along as fast as I could, and even so I didn&apos;t get to macros
until page 160.<br><br>But I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing.
The source code of the Viaweb editor was probably about 20-25%
macros.  Macros are harder to write than ordinary Lisp functions,
and it&apos;s considered to be bad style to use them when they&apos;re not
necessary.  So every macro in that code is there because it has to
be.  What that means is that at least 20-25% of the code in this
program is doing things that you can&apos;t easily do in any other
language.  However skeptical the Blub programmer might be about my
claims for the mysterious powers of Lisp, this ought to make him
curious.  We weren&apos;t writing this code for our own amusement.  We
were a tiny startup, programming as hard as we could in order to
put technical barriers between us and our competitors.<br><br>A suspicious person might begin to wonder if there was some
correlation here.  A big chunk of our code was doing things that
are very hard to do in other languages.  The resulting software
did things our competitors&apos; software couldn&apos;t do.  Maybe there was
some kind of connection.  I encourage you to follow that thread.
There may be more to that old man hobbling along on his crutches
than meets the eye.<br><br><b>Aikido for Startups</b><br><br>But I don&apos;t expect to convince anyone 
(<a href="http://www.trollope.org/scheme.html">over 25</a>) 
to go out and learn
Lisp.  The purpose of this article is not to change anyone&apos;s mind,
but to reassure people already interested in using Lisp-- people
who know that Lisp is a powerful language, but worry because it
isn&apos;t widely used.  In a competitive situation, that&apos;s an advantage.
Lisp&apos;s power is multiplied by the fact that your competitors don&apos;t
get it.<br><br>If you think of using Lisp in a startup, you shouldn&apos;t worry that
it isn&apos;t widely understood.  You should hope that it stays that
way. And it&apos;s likely to.  It&apos;s the nature of programming languages
to make most people satisfied with whatever they currently use.
Computer hardware changes so much faster than personal habits that
programming practice is usually ten to twenty years behind the
processor.  At places like MIT they were writing programs in
high-level languages in the early 1960s, but many companies continued
to write code in machine language well into the 1980s.  I bet a
lot of people continued to write machine language until the processor,
like a bartender eager to close up and go home, finally kicked them
out by switching to a risc instruction set.<br><br>Ordinarily technology changes fast.  But programming languages are
different: programming languages are not just technology, but what
programmers think in.  They&apos;re half technology and half religion.[6]
And so the median language, meaning whatever language the median
programmer uses, moves as slow as an iceberg.  Garbage collection,
introduced by Lisp in about 1960, is now widely considered to be
a good thing.  Runtime typing, ditto, is growing in popularity.
Lexical closures, introduced by Lisp in the early 1970s, are now,
just barely, on the radar screen.  Macros, introduced by Lisp in the
mid 1960s, are still terra incognita.<br><br>Obviously, the median language has enormous momentum.  I&apos;m not
proposing that you can fight this powerful force.  What I&apos;m proposing
is exactly the opposite: that, like a practitioner of Aikido, you
can use it against your opponents.<br><br>If you work for a big company, this may not be easy.  You will have
a hard time convincing the pointy-haired boss to let you build
things in Lisp, when he has just read in the paper that some other
language is poised, like Ada was twenty years ago, to take over
the world.  But if you work for a startup that doesn&apos;t have
pointy-haired bosses yet, you can, like we did, turn the Blub
paradox to your advantage:  you can use technology that your
competitors, glued immovably to the median language, will never be
able to match.<br><br>If you ever do find yourself working for a startup, here&apos;s a handy
tip for evaluating competitors.  Read their job listings.  Everything
else on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent,
but the job listings have to be specific about what they want, or
they&apos;ll get the wrong candidates.<br><br>During the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions.
A new competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month
or so.  The first thing I would do, after checking to see if they
had a live online demo, was look at their job listings.  After a
couple years of this I could tell which companies to worry about
and which not to.  The more of an IT flavor the job descriptions
had, the less dangerous the company was.  The safest kind were the
ones that wanted Oracle experience.  You never had to worry about
those.  You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java
developers.  If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would
be a bit frightening-- that&apos;s starting to sound like a company
where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers.  If I
had ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers, I would have
been really worried.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] Viaweb at first had two parts: the editor, written in Lisp,
which people used to build their sites, and the ordering system,
written in C, which handled orders.  The first version was mostly
Lisp, because the ordering system was small.  Later we added two
more modules, an image generator written in C, and a back-office
manager written mostly in Perl.<br><br>In January 2003, Yahoo released a new version of the editor 
written in C++ and Perl.  It&apos;s hard to say whether the program is no
longer written in Lisp, though, because to translate this program
into C++ they literally had to write a Lisp interpreter: the source
files of all the page-generating templates are still, as far as I
know,  Lisp code.  (See <a href="quotes.html">Greenspun&apos;s Tenth Rule</a>.)<br><br>[2] Robert Morris says that I didn&apos;t need to be secretive, because
even if our competitors had known we were using Lisp, they wouldn&apos;t
have understood why:  &quot;If they were that smart they&apos;d already be
programming in Lisp.&quot;<br><br>[3] All languages are equally powerful in the sense of being Turing
equivalent, but that&apos;s not the sense of the word programmers care
about. (No one wants to program a Turing machine.)  The kind of
power programmers care about may not be formally definable, but
one way to explain it would be to say that it refers to features
you could only get in the less powerful language by writing an
interpreter for the more powerful language in it. If language A
has an operator for removing spaces from strings and language B
doesn&apos;t, that probably doesn&apos;t make A more powerful, because you
can probably write a subroutine to do it in B.  But if A supports,
say, recursion, and B doesn&apos;t, that&apos;s not likely to be something
you can fix by writing library functions.<br><br>[4] Note to nerds: or possibly a lattice, narrowing toward the top;
it&apos;s not the shape that matters here but the idea that there is at
least a partial order.<br><br>[5] It is a bit misleading to treat macros as a separate feature.
In practice their usefulness is greatly enhanced by other Lisp
features like lexical closures and rest parameters.<br><br>[6] As a result, comparisons of programming languages either take
the form of religious wars or undergraduate textbooks so determinedly
neutral that they&apos;re really works of anthropology.  People who
value their peace, or want tenure, avoid the topic.  But the question
is only half a religious one; there is something there worth
studying, especially if you want to design new languages.<br><br></p></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="lwba.html">More Technical Details</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.shiro.dreamhost.com/scheme/trans/beating-the-averages-j.html">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://ileriseviye.org/arasayfa.php?inode=beatingaverages-tr.html">Turkish Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://bobir.livejournal.com/17358.html">Uzbek Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="carl.html">Orbitz Uses Lisp Too</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">How To Become A Hacker</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.trollope.org/scheme.html">A Scheme Story</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br>

several other programmers about why Java smelled suspicious.  It&apos;s not
a critique of Java!  It is a case study of hacker&apos;s radar.<br><br>Over time, hackers develop a nose for good (and bad) technology.
I thought it might be interesting to try and write down what
made Java seem suspect to me.<br><br>Some people who&apos;ve read this think it&apos;s an interesting attempt to write about
something that hasn&apos;t been written about before.  Others say I
will get in trouble for appearing to be writing about
things I don&apos;t understand.  So, just in
case it does any good, let me clarify that I&apos;m not writing here
about Java (which I have never used) but about hacker&apos;s radar
(which I have thought about a lot).<br><br><br><br>The aphorism &quot;you can&apos;t tell a book by its cover&quot; originated in
the times when books were sold in plain cardboard covers, to be
bound by each purchaser according to his own taste.  In those days,
you couldn&apos;t tell a book by its cover.  But publishing has advanced
since then: present-day publishers work hard to make the cover
something you can tell a book by.<br><br>I spend a lot of time in bookshops and I feel as if I have by now
learned to understand everything publishers mean to tell me about
a book, and perhaps a bit more.  The time I haven&apos;t spent in
bookshops I&apos;ve spent mostly in front of computers, and I feel as
if I&apos;ve learned, to some degree, to judge technology by its cover
as well.  It may be just luck, but I&apos;ve saved myself from a few
technologies that turned out to be real stinkers.<br><br>So far, Java seems like a stinker to me.  I&apos;ve never written a Java
program, never more than glanced over reference books about it,
but I have a hunch that it won&apos;t be a very successful language.
I may turn out to be mistaken; making predictions about technology
is a dangerous business.  But for what it&apos;s worth, as a sort of
time capsule, here&apos;s why I don&apos;t like the look of Java:<br><br>
1. It has been so energetically hyped.  Real standards don&apos;t have
to be promoted.  No one had to promote C, or Unix, or HTML.  A real
standard tends to be already established by the time most people
hear about it.  On the hacker radar screen, Perl is as big as Java,
or bigger, just on the strength of its own merits.<br><br>2. It&apos;s aimed low.  In the original Java white paper, Gosling
explicitly says Java was designed not to be too difficult for
programmers used to C.  It was designed to be another C++: C plus
a few ideas taken from more advanced languages.  Like the creators
of sitcoms or junk food or package tours, Java&apos;s designers were
consciously designing a product for people not as smart as them.
Historically, languages designed for other people to use have been
bad:  Cobol, PL/I, Pascal, Ada, C++.  The good languages have been
those that were designed for their own creators:  C, Perl, Smalltalk,
Lisp.<br><br>3. It has ulterior motives.  Someone once said that the world would
be a better place if people only wrote books because they had
something to say, rather than because they wanted to write a book.
Likewise, the reason we hear about Java all the time is not because
it has something to say about programming languages.  We hear about
Java as part of a plan by Sun to undermine Microsoft.<br><br>4. No one loves it.  C, Perl, Python, Smalltalk, and Lisp programmers
love their languages.  I&apos;ve never heard anyone say that they loved
Java.<br><br>5. People are forced to use it.  A lot of the people I know using
Java are using it because they feel they have to.  Either it&apos;s
something they felt they had to do to get funded, or something they
thought customers would want, or something they were told to do by
management.  These are smart people; if the technology was good,
they&apos;d have used it voluntarily.<br><br>6. It has too many cooks.  The best programming languages have been
developed by small groups.  Java seems to be run by a committee.
If it turns out to be a good language, it will be the first time
in history that a committee has designed a good language.<br><br>7. It&apos;s bureaucratic.  From what little I know about Java, there
seem to be a lot of protocols for doing things.  Really good
languages aren&apos;t like that.  They let you do what you want and get
out of the way.<br><br>8. It&apos;s pseudo-hip.  Sun now pretends that Java is a grassroots,
open-source language effort like Perl or Python.  This one just
happens to be controlled by a giant company.  So the language is
likely to have the same drab clunkiness as anything else that comes
out of a big company.<br><br>9. It&apos;s designed for large organizations.  Large organizations have
different aims from hackers. They want languages that are (believed
to be) suitable for use by large teams of mediocre programmers--
languages with features that, like the speed limiters in U-Haul
trucks, prevent fools from doing too much damage.  Hackers don&apos;t
like a language that talks down to them.  Hackers just want power.
Historically, languages designed for large organizations (PL/I,
Ada) have lost, while hacker languages (C, Perl) have won.  The
reason: today&apos;s teenage hacker is tomorrow&apos;s CTO.<br><br>10. The wrong people like it.  The programmers I admire most are
not, on the whole, captivated by Java.  Who does like Java?  Suits,
who don&apos;t know one language from another, but know that they keep
hearing about Java in the press; programmers at big companies, who
are amazed to find that there is something even better than C++;
and plug-and-chug undergrads, who are ready to like anything that
might get them a job (will this be on the test?).  These people&apos;s
opinions change with every wind.<br><br>11. Its daddy is in a pinch.  Sun&apos;s business model is being undermined
on two fronts.  Cheap Intel processors, of the same type used in
desktop machines, are now more than fast enough for servers.  And
FreeBSD seems to be at least as good an OS for servers as Solaris.
Sun&apos;s advertising implies that you need Sun servers for industrial
strength applications.  If this were true, Yahoo would be first in
line to buy Suns;  but when I worked there, the servers were all
Intel boxes running FreeBSD.  This bodes ill for Sun&apos;s future.  If
Sun runs into trouble, they could drag Java down with them.<br><br>12. The DoD likes it.  The Defense Department is encouraging
developers to use Java. This seems to me the most damning sign of
all.  The Defense Department does a fine (though expensive) job of
defending the country, but they love plans and procedures and
protocols.  Their culture is the opposite of hacker culture; on
questions of software they will tend to bet wrong.  The last time
the DoD really liked a programming language, it was Ada.<br><br>
Bear in mind, this is not a critique of Java, but a critique of
its cover.  I don&apos;t know Java well enough to like it or dislike
it.  This is just an explanation of why I don&apos;t find that I&apos;m eager
to learn it.<br><br>It may seem cavalier to dismiss a language before you&apos;ve even tried
writing programs in it.  But this is something all programmers have
to do.  There are too many technologies out there to learn them
all.  You have to learn to judge by outward signs which will be
worth your time.  I have likewise cavalierly dismissed Cobol, Ada,
Visual Basic, the IBM AS400, VRML, ISO 9000, the SET protocol, VMS,
Novell Netware, and CORBA, among others.  They just smelled wrong.<br><br>It could be that in Java&apos;s case I&apos;m mistaken.  It could be that a
language promoted by one big company to undermine another, designed
by a committee for a &quot;mainstream&quot; audience, hyped to the skies,
and beloved of the DoD, happens nonetheless to be a clean, beautiful,
powerful language that I would love programming in.  It could be,
but it seems very unlikely.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="trevrejavcov.html">Trevor Re: Java&apos;s Cover</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="bljava.html">Berners-Lee Re: Java</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="popular.html">Being Popular</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.archub.org/javamemo.txt">Sun Internal Memo</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2005/tc20051213_042973.htm">2005: BusinessWeek Agrees</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/lionfan/20070211">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="popular">Being Popular</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">May 2001<br><br><i>(This article was written as a kind of business plan for a
<a href="arc.html">new language</a>.
So it is missing (because it takes for granted) the most important
feature of a good programming language: very powerful abstractions.)</i><br><br>A friend of mine once told an eminent operating systems
expert that he wanted to design a really good
programming language.  The expert told him that it would be a
waste of time, that programming languages don&apos;t become popular
or unpopular based on their merits, and so no matter how
good his language was, no one would use it.  At least, that
was what had happened to the language <i>he</i> had designed.<br><br>What does make a language popular?  Do popular
languages deserve their popularity?  Is it worth trying to
define a good programming language?  How would you do it?<br><br>I think the answers to these questions can be found by looking 
at hackers, and learning what they want.  Programming
languages are <i>for</i> hackers, and a programming language
is good as a programming language (rather than, say, an
exercise in denotational semantics or compiler design)
if and only if hackers like it.<br><br><b>1 The Mechanics of Popularity</b><br><br>It&apos;s true, certainly, that most people don&apos;t choose programming
languages simply based on their merits.  Most programmers are told
what language to use by someone else.  And yet I think the effect
of such external factors on the popularity of programming languages
is not as great as it&apos;s sometimes thought to be. I think a bigger
problem is that a hacker&apos;s idea of a good programming language is
not the same as most language designers&apos;.<br><br>Between the two, the hacker&apos;s opinion is the one that matters.
Programming languages are not theorems. They&apos;re tools, designed
for people, and they have to be designed to suit human strengths
and weaknesses as much as shoes have to be designed for human feet.
If a shoe pinches when you put it on, it&apos;s a bad shoe, however
elegant it may be as a piece of sculpture.<br><br>It may be that the majority of programmers can&apos;t tell a good language
from a bad one. But that&apos;s no different with any other tool. It
doesn&apos;t mean that it&apos;s a waste of time to try designing a good
language. <a href="design.html">Expert hackers</a> 
can tell a good language when they see
one, and they&apos;ll use it. Expert hackers are a tiny minority,
admittedly, but that tiny minority write all the good software,
and their influence is such that the rest of the programmers will
tend to use whatever language they use. Often, indeed, it is not
merely influence but command: often the expert hackers are the very
people who, as their bosses or faculty advisors, tell the other
programmers what language to use.<br><br>The opinion of expert hackers is not the only force that determines
the relative popularity of programming languages-- legacy software
(Cobol) and hype (Ada, Java) also play a role-- but I think it is
the most powerful force over the long term. Given an initial critical
mass and enough time, a programming language probably becomes about
as popular as it deserves to be. And popularity further separates
good languages from bad ones, because feedback from real live users
always leads to improvements. Look at how much any popular language
has changed during its life. Perl and Fortran are extreme cases,
but even Lisp has changed a lot. Lisp 1.5 didn&apos;t have macros, for
example; these evolved later, after hackers at MIT had spent a
couple years using Lisp to write real programs. [1]<br><br>So whether or not a language has to be good to be popular, I think
a language has to be popular to be good. And it has to stay popular
to stay good. The state of the art in programming languages doesn&apos;t
stand still. And yet the Lisps we have today are still pretty much
what they had at MIT in the mid-1980s, because that&apos;s the last time
Lisp had a sufficiently large and demanding user base.<br><br>Of course, hackers have to know about a language before they can
use it. How are they to hear? From other hackers. But there has to
be some initial group of hackers using the language for others even
to hear about it. I wonder how large this group has to be; how many
users make a critical mass? Off the top of my head, I&apos;d say twenty.
If a language had twenty separate users, meaning twenty users who
decided on their own to use it, I&apos;d consider it to be real.<br><br>Getting there can&apos;t be easy. I would not be surprised if it is
harder to get from zero to twenty than from twenty to a thousand.
The best way to get those initial twenty users is probably to use
a trojan horse: to give people an application they want, which
happens to be written in the new language.<br><br><b>2 External Factors</b><br><br>Let&apos;s start by acknowledging one external factor that does affect
the popularity of a programming language. To become popular, a
programming language has to be the scripting language of a popular
system. Fortran and Cobol were the scripting languages of early
IBM mainframes. C was the scripting language of Unix, and so, later,
was Perl. Tcl is the scripting language of Tk. Java and Javascript
are intended to be the scripting languages of web browsers.<br><br>Lisp is not a massively popular language because it is not the
scripting language of a massively popular system. What popularity
it retains dates back to the 1960s and 1970s, when it was the
scripting language of MIT. A lot of the great programmers of the
day were associated with MIT at some point. And in the early 1970s,
before C, MIT&apos;s dialect of Lisp, called MacLisp, was one of the
only programming languages a serious hacker would want to use.<br><br>Today Lisp is the scripting language of two moderately popular
systems, Emacs and Autocad, and for that reason I suspect that most
of the Lisp programming done today is done in Emacs Lisp or AutoLisp.<br><br>Programming languages don&apos;t exist in isolation. To hack is a
transitive verb-- hackers are usually hacking something-- and in
practice languages are judged relative to whatever they&apos;re used to
hack. So if you want to design a popular language, you either have
to supply more than a language, or you have to design your language
to replace the scripting language of some existing system.<br><br>Common Lisp is unpopular partly because it&apos;s an orphan. It did
originally come with a system to hack: the Lisp Machine. But Lisp
Machines (along with parallel computers) were steamrollered by the
increasing power of general purpose processors in the 1980s. Common
Lisp might have remained popular if it had been a good scripting
language for Unix. It is, alas, an atrociously bad one.<br><br>One way to describe this situation is to say that a language isn&apos;t
judged on its own merits. Another view is that a programming language
really isn&apos;t a programming language unless it&apos;s also the scripting
language of something. This only seems unfair if it comes as a
surprise. I think it&apos;s no more unfair than expecting a programming
language to have, say, an implementation. It&apos;s just part of what
a programming language is.<br><br>A programming language does need a good implementation, of course,
and this must be free. Companies will pay for software, but individual
hackers won&apos;t, and it&apos;s the hackers you need to attract.<br><br>A language also needs to have a book about it. The book should be
thin, well-written, and full of good examples. K&amp;R is the ideal
here. At the moment I&apos;d almost say that a language has to have a
book published by O&apos;Reilly. That&apos;s becoming the test of mattering
to hackers.<br><br>There should be online documentation as well. In fact, the book
can start as online documentation. But I don&apos;t think that physical
books are outmoded yet. Their format is convenient, and the de
facto censorship imposed by publishers is a useful if imperfect
filter. Bookstores are one of the most important places for learning
about new languages.<br><br><b>3 Brevity</b><br><br>Given that you can supply the three things any language needs-- a
free implementation, a book, and something to hack-- how do you
make a language that hackers will like?<br><br>One thing hackers like is brevity. Hackers are lazy, in the same
way that mathematicians and modernist architects are lazy: they
hate anything extraneous. It would not be far from the truth to
say that a hacker about to write a program decides what language
to use, at least subconsciously, based on the total number of
characters he&apos;ll have to type. If this isn&apos;t precisely how hackers
think, a language designer would do well to act as if it were.<br><br>It is a mistake to try to baby the user with long-winded expressions
that are meant to resemble English. Cobol is notorious for this
flaw. A hacker would consider being asked to write<br><br>add x to y giving z<br><br>instead of<br><br>z = x+y<br><br>as something between an insult to his intelligence and a sin against
God.<br><br>It has sometimes been said that Lisp should use first and rest
instead of car and cdr, because it would make programs easier to
read. Maybe for the first couple hours. But a hacker can learn
quickly enough that car means the first element of a list and cdr
means the rest. Using first and rest means 50% more typing. And
they are also different lengths, meaning that the arguments won&apos;t
line up when they&apos;re called, as car and cdr often are, in successive
lines. I&apos;ve found that it matters a lot how code lines up on the
page. I can barely read Lisp code when it is set in a variable-width
font, and friends say this is true for other languages too.<br><br>Brevity is one place where strongly typed languages lose. All other
things being equal, no one wants to begin a program with a bunch
of declarations. Anything that can be implicit, should be.<br><br>The individual tokens should be short as well. Perl and Common Lisp
occupy opposite poles on this question. Perl programs can be almost
cryptically dense, while the names of built-in Common Lisp operators
are comically long. The designers of Common Lisp probably expected
users to have text editors that would type these long names for
them. But the cost of a long name is not just the cost of typing
it. There is also the cost of reading it, and the cost of the space
it takes up on your screen.<br><br><b>4 Hackability</b><br><br>There is one thing more important than brevity to a hacker: being
able to do what you want. In the history of programming languages
a surprising amount of effort has gone into preventing programmers
from doing things considered to be improper. This is a dangerously
presumptuous plan. How can the language designer know what the
programmer is going to need to do? I think language designers would
do better to consider their target user to be a genius who will
need to do things they never anticipated, rather than a bumbler
who needs to be protected from himself. The bumbler will shoot
himself in the foot anyway. You may save him from referring to
variables in another package, but you can&apos;t save him from writing
a badly designed program to solve the wrong problem, and taking
forever to do it.<br><br>Good programmers often want to do dangerous and unsavory things.
By unsavory I mean things that go behind whatever semantic facade
the language is trying to present: getting hold of the internal
representation of some high-level abstraction, for example. Hackers
like to hack, and hacking means getting inside things and second
guessing the original designer.<br><br><i>Let yourself be second guessed.</i> When you make any tool, people use
it in ways you didn&apos;t intend, and this is especially true of a
highly articulated tool like a programming language. Many a hacker
will want to tweak your semantic model in a way that you never
imagined. I say, let them; give the programmer access to as much
internal stuff as you can without endangering runtime systems like
the garbage collector.<br><br>In Common Lisp I have often wanted to iterate through the fields
of a struct-- to comb out references to a deleted object, for example,
or find fields that are uninitialized. I know the structs are just
vectors underneath. And yet I can&apos;t write a general purpose function
that I can call on any struct. I can only access the fields by
name, because that&apos;s what a struct is supposed to mean.<br><br>A hacker may only want to subvert the intended model of things once
or twice in a big program. But what a difference it makes to be
able to. And it may be more than a question of just solving a
problem. There is a kind of pleasure here too. Hackers share the
surgeon&apos;s secret pleasure in poking about in gross innards, the
teenager&apos;s secret pleasure in popping zits. [2] For boys, at least,
certain kinds of horrors are fascinating. Maxim magazine publishes
an annual volume of photographs, containing a mix of pin-ups and
grisly accidents. They know their audience.<br><br>Historically, Lisp has been good at letting hackers have their way.
The political correctness of Common Lisp is an aberration. Early
Lisps let you get your hands on everything. A good deal of that
spirit is, fortunately, preserved in macros. What a wonderful thing,
to be able to make arbitrary transformations on the source code.<br><br>Classic macros are a real hacker&apos;s tool-- simple, powerful, and
dangerous. It&apos;s so easy to understand what they do: you call a
function on the macro&apos;s arguments, and whatever it returns gets
inserted in place of the macro call. Hygienic macros embody the
opposite principle. They try to protect you from understanding what
they&apos;re doing. I have never heard hygienic macros explained in one
sentence. And they are a classic example of the dangers of deciding
what programmers are allowed to want. Hygienic macros are intended
to protect me from variable capture, among other things, but variable
capture is exactly what I want in some macros.<br><br>A really good language should be both clean and dirty: cleanly
designed, with a small core of well understood and highly orthogonal
operators, but dirty in the sense that it lets hackers have their
way with it. C is like this. So were the early Lisps. A real hacker&apos;s
language will always have a slightly raffish character.<br><br>A good programming language should have features that make the kind
of people who use the phrase &quot;software engineering&quot; shake their
heads disapprovingly. At the other end of the continuum are languages
like Ada and Pascal, models of propriety that are good for teaching
and not much else.<br><br><b>5 Throwaway Programs</b><br><br>To be attractive to hackers, a language must be good for writing
the kinds of programs they want to write. And that means, perhaps
surprisingly, that it has to be good for writing throwaway programs.<br><br>A throwaway program is a program you write quickly for some limited
task: a program to automate some system administration task, or
generate test data for a simulation, or convert data from one format
to another. The surprising thing about throwaway programs is that,
like the &quot;temporary&quot; buildings built at so many American universities
during World War II, they often don&apos;t get thrown away. Many evolve
into real programs, with real features and real users.<br><br>I have a hunch that the best big programs begin life this way,
rather than being designed big from the start, like the Hoover Dam.
It&apos;s terrifying to build something big from scratch. When people
take on a project that&apos;s too big, they become overwhelmed. The
project either gets bogged down, or the result is sterile and
wooden: a shopping mall rather than a real downtown, Brasilia rather
than Rome, Ada rather than C.<br><br>Another way to get a big program is to start with a throwaway
program and keep improving it. This approach is less daunting, and
the design of the program benefits from evolution. I think, if one
looked, that this would turn out to be the way most big programs
were developed. And those that did evolve this way are probably
still written in whatever language they were first written in,
because it&apos;s rare for a program to be ported, except for political
reasons. And so, paradoxically, if you want to make a language that
is used for big systems, you have to make it good for writing
throwaway programs, because that&apos;s where big systems come from.<br><br>Perl is a striking example of this idea. It was not only designed
for writing throwaway programs, but was pretty much a throwaway
program itself. Perl began life as a collection of utilities for
generating reports, and only evolved into a programming language
as the throwaway programs people wrote in it grew larger. It was
not until Perl 5 (if then) that the language was suitable for
writing serious programs, and yet it was already massively popular.<br><br>What makes a language good for throwaway programs? To start with,
it must be readily available. A throwaway program is something that
you expect to write in an hour. So the language probably must
already be installed on the computer you&apos;re using. It can&apos;t be
something you have to install before you use it. It has to be there.
C was there because it came with the operating system. Perl was
there because it was originally a tool for system administrators,
and yours had already installed it.<br><br>Being available means more than being installed, though. An
interactive language, with a command-line interface, is more
available than one that you have to compile and run separately. A
popular programming language should be interactive, and start up
fast.<br><br>Another thing you want in a throwaway program is brevity. Brevity
is always attractive to hackers, and never more so than in a program
they expect to turn out in an hour.<br><br><b>6 Libraries</b><br><br>Of course the ultimate in brevity is to have the program already
written for you, and merely to call it. And this brings us to what
I think will be an increasingly important feature of programming
languages: library functions. Perl wins because it has large
libraries for manipulating strings. This class of library functions
are especially important for throwaway programs, which are often
originally written for converting or extracting data.  Many Perl
programs probably begin as just a couple library calls stuck
together.<br><br>I think a lot of the advances that happen in programming languages
in the next fifty years will have to do with library functions. I
think future programming languages will have libraries that are as
carefully designed as the core language. Programming language design
will not be about whether to make your language strongly or weakly
typed, or object oriented, or functional, or whatever, but about
how to design great libraries. The kind of language designers who
like to think about how to design type systems may shudder at this.
It&apos;s almost like writing applications! Too bad. Languages are for
programmers, and libraries are what programmers need.<br><br>It&apos;s hard to design good libraries. It&apos;s not simply a matter of
writing a lot of code. Once the libraries get too big, it can
sometimes take longer to find the function you need than to write
the code yourself. Libraries need to be designed using a small set
of orthogonal operators, just like the core language. It ought to
be possible for the programmer to guess what library call will do
what he needs.<br><br>Libraries are one place Common Lisp falls short. There are only
rudimentary libraries for manipulating strings, and almost none
for talking to the operating system. For historical reasons, Common
Lisp tries to pretend that the OS doesn&apos;t exist. And because you
can&apos;t talk to the OS, you&apos;re unlikely to be able to write a serious
program using only the built-in operators in Common Lisp. You have
to use some implementation-specific hacks as well, and in practice
these tend not to give you everything you want. Hackers would think
a lot more highly of Lisp if Common Lisp had powerful string
libraries and good OS support.<br><br><b>7 Syntax</b><br><br>Could a language with Lisp&apos;s syntax, or more precisely, lack of
syntax, ever become popular? I don&apos;t know the answer to this
question. I do think that syntax is not the main reason Lisp isn&apos;t
currently popular. Common Lisp has worse problems than unfamiliar
syntax. I know several programmers who are comfortable with prefix
syntax and yet use Perl by default, because it has powerful string
libraries and can talk to the os.<br><br>There are two possible problems with prefix notation: that it is
unfamiliar to programmers, and that it is not dense enough. The
conventional wisdom in the Lisp world is that the first problem is
the real one. I&apos;m not so sure. Yes, prefix notation makes ordinary
programmers panic. But I don&apos;t think ordinary programmers&apos; opinions
matter. Languages become popular or unpopular based on what expert
hackers think of them, and I think expert hackers might be able to
deal with prefix notation. Perl syntax can be pretty incomprehensible,
but that has not stood in the way of Perl&apos;s popularity. If anything
it may have helped foster a Perl cult.<br><br>A more serious problem is the diffuseness of prefix notation. For
expert hackers, that really is a problem. No one wants to write
(aref a x y) when they could write a[x,y].<br><br>In this particular case there is a way to finesse our way out of
the problem. If we treat data structures as if they were functions
on indexes, we could write (a x y) instead, which is even shorter
than the Perl form. Similar tricks may shorten other types of
expressions.<br><br>We can get rid of (or make optional) a lot of parentheses by making
indentation significant. That&apos;s how programmers read code anyway:
when indentation says one thing and delimiters say another, we go
by the indentation. Treating indentation as significant would
eliminate this common source of bugs as well as making programs
shorter.<br><br>Sometimes infix syntax is easier to read. This is especially true
for math expressions. I&apos;ve used Lisp my whole programming life and
I still don&apos;t find prefix math expressions natural. And yet it is
convenient, especially when you&apos;re generating code, to have operators
that take any number of arguments. So if we do have infix syntax,
it should probably be implemented as some kind of read-macro.<br><br>I don&apos;t think we should be religiously opposed to introducing syntax
into Lisp, as long as it translates in a well-understood way into
underlying s-expressions. There is already a good deal of syntax
in Lisp. It&apos;s not necessarily bad to introduce more, as long as no
one is forced to use it. In Common Lisp, some delimiters are reserved
for the language, suggesting that at least some of the designers
intended to have more syntax in the future.<br><br>One of the most egregiously unlispy pieces of syntax in Common Lisp
occurs in format strings; format is a language in its own right,
and that language is not Lisp. If there were a plan for introducing
more syntax into Lisp, format specifiers might be able to be included
in it. It would be a good thing if macros could generate format
specifiers the way they generate any other kind of code.<br><br>An eminent Lisp hacker told me that his copy of CLTL falls open to
the section format. Mine too. This probably indicates room for
improvement. It may also mean that programs do a lot of I/O.<br><br><b>8 Efficiency</b><br><br>A good language, as everyone knows, should generate fast code. But
in practice I don&apos;t think fast code comes primarily from things
you do in the design of the language. As Knuth pointed out long
ago, speed only matters in certain critical bottlenecks.  And as
many programmers have observed since, one is very often mistaken
about where these bottlenecks are.<br><br>So, in practice, the way to get fast code is to have a very good
profiler, rather than by, say, making the language strongly typed.
You don&apos;t need to know the type of every argument in every call in
the program. You do need to be able to declare the types of arguments
in the bottlenecks. And even more, you need to be able to find out
where the bottlenecks are.<br><br>One complaint people have had with Lisp is that it&apos;s hard to tell
what&apos;s expensive. This might be true. It might also be inevitable,
if you want to have a very abstract language. And in any case I
think good profiling would go a long way toward fixing the problem:
you&apos;d soon learn what was expensive.<br><br>Part of the problem here is social. Language designers like to
write fast compilers. That&apos;s how they measure their skill. They
think of the profiler as an add-on, at best. But in practice a good
profiler may do more to improve the speed of actual programs written
in the language than a compiler that generates fast code. Here,
again, language designers are somewhat out of touch with their
users. They do a really good job of solving slightly the wrong
problem.<br><br>It might be a good idea to have an active profiler-- to push
performance data to the programmer instead of waiting for him to
come asking for it. For example, the editor could display bottlenecks
in red when the programmer edits the source code. Another approach
would be to somehow represent what&apos;s happening in running programs.
This would be an especially big win in server-based applications,
where you have lots of running programs to look at. An active
profiler could show graphically what&apos;s happening in memory as a
program&apos;s running, or even make sounds that tell what&apos;s happening.<br><br>Sound is a good cue to problems. In one place I worked, we had a
big board of dials showing what was happening to our web servers.
The hands were moved by little servomotors that made a slight noise
when they turned. I couldn&apos;t see the board from my desk, but I
found that I could tell immediately, by the sound, when there was
a problem with a server.<br><br>It might even be possible to write a profiler that would automatically
detect inefficient algorithms. I would not be surprised if certain
patterns of memory access turned out to be sure signs of bad
algorithms. If there were a little guy running around inside the
computer executing our programs, he would probably have as long
and plaintive a tale to tell about his job as a federal government
employee. I often have a feeling that I&apos;m sending the processor on
a lot of wild goose chases, but I&apos;ve never had a good way to look
at what it&apos;s doing.<br><br>A number of Lisps now compile into byte code, which is then executed
by an interpreter. This is usually done to make the implementation
easier to port, but it could be a useful language feature. It might
be a good idea to make the byte code an official part of the
language, and to allow programmers to use inline byte code in
bottlenecks. Then such optimizations would be portable too.<br><br>The nature of speed, as perceived by the end-user, may be changing.
With the rise of server-based applications, more and more programs
may turn out to be i/o-bound. It will be worth making i/o fast.
The language can help with straightforward measures like simple,
fast, formatted output functions, and also with deep structural
changes like caching and persistent objects.<br><br>Users are interested in response time. But another kind of efficiency
will be increasingly important: the number of simultaneous users
you can support per processor. Many of the interesting applications
written in the near future will be server-based, and the number of
users per server is the critical question for anyone hosting such
applications. In the capital cost of a business offering a server-based
application, this is the divisor.<br><br>For years, efficiency hasn&apos;t mattered much in most end-user
applications. Developers have been able to assume that each user
would have an increasingly powerful processor sitting on their
desk. And by Parkinson&apos;s Law, software has expanded to use the
resources available. That will change with server-based applications.
In that world, the hardware and software will be supplied together.
For companies that offer server-based applications, it will make
a very big difference to the bottom line how many users they can
support per server.<br><br>In some applications, the processor will be the limiting factor,
and execution speed will be the most important thing to optimize.
But often memory will be the limit; the number of simultaneous
users will be determined by the amount of memory you need for each
user&apos;s data. The language can help here too. Good support for
threads will enable all the users to share a single heap. It may
also help to have persistent objects and/or language level support
for lazy loading.<br><br><b>9 Time</b><br><br>The last ingredient a popular language needs is time. No one wants
to write programs in a language that might go away, as so many
programming languages do. So most hackers will tend to wait until
a language has been around for a couple years before even considering
using it.<br><br>Inventors of wonderful new things are often surprised to discover
this, but you need time to get any message through to people. A
friend of mine rarely does anything the first time someone asks
him. He knows that people sometimes ask for things that they turn
out not to want. To avoid wasting his time, he waits till the third
or fourth time he&apos;s asked to do something; by then, whoever&apos;s asking
him may be fairly annoyed, but at least they probably really do
want whatever they&apos;re asking for.<br><br>Most people have learned to do a similar sort of filtering on new
things they hear about. They don&apos;t even start paying attention
until they&apos;ve heard about something ten times. They&apos;re perfectly
justified: the majority of hot new whatevers do turn out to be a
waste of time, and eventually go away. By delaying learning VRML,
I avoided having to learn it at all.<br><br>So anyone who invents something new has to expect to keep repeating
their message for years before people will start to get it. We
wrote what was, as far as I know, the first web-server based
application, and it took us years to get it through to people that
it didn&apos;t have to be downloaded. It wasn&apos;t that they were stupid.
They just had us tuned out.<br><br>The good news is, simple repetition solves the problem. All you
have to do is keep telling your story, and eventually people will
start to hear. It&apos;s not when people notice you&apos;re there that they
pay attention; it&apos;s when they notice you&apos;re still there.<br><br>It&apos;s just as well that it usually takes a while to gain momentum.
Most technologies evolve a good deal even after they&apos;re first
launched-- programming languages especially. Nothing could be better,
for a new techology, than a few years of being used only by a small
number of early adopters. Early adopters are sophisticated and
demanding, and quickly flush out whatever flaws remain in your
technology. When you only have a few users you can be in close
contact with all of them. And early adopters are forgiving when
you improve your system, even if this causes some breakage.<br><br>There are two ways new technology gets introduced: the organic
growth method, and the big bang method. The organic growth method
is exemplified by the classic seat-of-the-pants underfunded garage
startup. A couple guys, working in obscurity, develop some new
technology. They launch it with no marketing and initially have
only a few (fanatically devoted) users. They continue to improve
the technology, and meanwhile their user base grows by word of
mouth. Before they know it, they&apos;re big.<br><br>The other approach, the big bang method, is exemplified by the
VC-backed, heavily marketed startup. They rush to develop a product,
launch it with great publicity, and immediately (they hope) have
a large user base.<br><br>Generally, the garage guys envy the big bang guys. The big bang
guys are smooth and confident and respected by the VCs. They can
afford the best of everything, and the PR campaign surrounding the
launch has the side effect of making them celebrities. The organic
growth guys, sitting in their garage, feel poor and unloved. And
yet I think they are often mistaken to feel sorry for themselves.
Organic growth seems to yield better technology and richer founders
than the big bang method. If you look at the dominant technologies
today, you&apos;ll find that most of them grew organically.<br><br>This pattern doesn&apos;t only apply to companies. You see it in sponsored
research too. Multics and Common Lisp were big-bang projects, and
Unix and MacLisp were organic growth projects.<br><br><b>10 Redesign</b><br><br>&quot;The best writing is rewriting,&quot; wrote E. B. White.  Every good
writer knows this, and it&apos;s true for software too. The most important
part of design is redesign. Programming languages, especially,
don&apos;t get redesigned enough.<br><br>To write good software you must simultaneously keep two opposing
ideas in your head. You need the young hacker&apos;s naive faith in
his abilities, and at the same time the veteran&apos;s skepticism. You
have to be able to think 
<a href="http://www.trevorblackwell.com">how hard can it be?</a> with one half of
your brain while thinking 
<a href="http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/~rtm/">it will never work</a> with the other.<br><br>The trick is to realize that there&apos;s no real contradiction here.
You want to be optimistic and skeptical about two different things.
You have to be optimistic about the possibility of solving the
problem, but skeptical about the value of whatever solution you&apos;ve
got so far.<br><br>People who do good work often think that whatever they&apos;re working
on is no good. Others see what they&apos;ve done and are full of wonder,
but the creator is full of worry. This pattern is no coincidence:
it is the worry that made the work good.<br><br>If you can keep hope and worry balanced, they will drive a project
forward the same way your two legs drive a bicycle forward. In the
first phase of the two-cycle innovation engine, you work furiously
on some problem, inspired by your confidence that you&apos;ll be able
to solve it. In the second phase, you look at what you&apos;ve done in
the cold light of morning, and see all its flaws very clearly. But
as long as your critical spirit doesn&apos;t outweigh your hope, you&apos;ll
be able to look at your admittedly incomplete system, and think,
how hard can it be to get the rest of the way?, thereby continuing
the cycle.<br><br>It&apos;s tricky to keep the two forces balanced. In young hackers,
optimism predominates. They produce something, are convinced it&apos;s
great, and never improve it. In old hackers, skepticism predominates,
and they won&apos;t even dare to take on ambitious projects.<br><br>Anything you can do to keep the redesign cycle going is good. Prose
can be rewritten over and over until you&apos;re happy with it. But
software, as a rule, doesn&apos;t get redesigned enough. Prose has
readers, but software has <i>users.</i> If a writer rewrites an essay,
people who read the old version are unlikely to complain that their
thoughts have been broken by some newly introduced incompatibility.<br><br>Users are a double-edged sword. They can help you improve your
language, but they can also deter you from improving it. So choose
your users carefully, and be slow to grow their number. Having
users is like optimization: the wise course is to delay it. Also,
as a general rule, you can at any given time get away with changing
more than you think. Introducing change is like pulling off a
bandage: the pain is a memory almost as soon as you feel it.<br><br>Everyone knows that it&apos;s not a good idea to have a language designed
by a committee. Committees yield bad design. But I think the worst
danger of committees is that they interfere with redesign. It is
so much work to introduce changes that no one wants to bother.
Whatever a committee decides tends to stay that way, even if most
of the members don&apos;t like it.<br><br>Even a committee of two gets in the way of redesign. This happens
particularly in the interfaces between pieces of software written
by two different people. To change the interface both have to agree
to change it at once. And so interfaces tend not to change at all,
which is a problem because they tend to be one of the most ad hoc
parts of any system.<br><br>One solution here might be to design systems so that interfaces
are horizontal instead of vertical-- so that modules are always
vertically stacked strata of abstraction. Then the interface will
tend to be owned by one of them. The lower of two levels will either
be a language in which the upper is written, in which case the
lower level will own the interface, or it will be a slave, in which
case the interface can be dictated by the upper level.<br><br><b>11 Lisp</b><br><br>What all this implies is that there is hope for a new Lisp.  There
is hope for any language that gives hackers what they want, including
Lisp. I think we may have made a mistake in thinking that hackers
are turned off by Lisp&apos;s strangeness. This comforting illusion may
have prevented us from seeing the real problem with Lisp, or at
least Common Lisp, which is that it sucks for doing what hackers
want to do. A hacker&apos;s language needs powerful libraries and
something to hack. Common Lisp has neither. A hacker&apos;s language is
terse and hackable. Common Lisp is not.<br><br>The good news is, it&apos;s not Lisp that sucks, but Common Lisp. If we
can develop a new Lisp that is a real hacker&apos;s language, I think
hackers will use it. They will use whatever language does the job.
All we have to do is make sure this new Lisp does some important
job better than other languages.<br><br>History offers some encouragement. Over time, successive new
programming languages have taken more and more features from Lisp.
There is no longer much left to copy before the language you&apos;ve
made is Lisp. The latest hot language, Python, is a watered-down
Lisp with infix syntax and no macros. A new Lisp would be a natural
step in this progression.<br><br>I sometimes think that it would be a good marketing trick to call
it an improved version of Python. That sounds hipper than Lisp. To
many people, Lisp is a slow AI language with a lot of parentheses.
Fritz Kunze&apos;s official biography carefully avoids mentioning the
L-word.  But my guess is that we shouldn&apos;t be afraid to call the
new Lisp Lisp. Lisp still has a lot of latent respect among the
very best hackers-- the ones who took 6.001 and understood it, for
example. And those are the users you need to win.<br><br>In &quot;How to Become a Hacker,&quot; Eric Raymond describes Lisp as something
like Latin or Greek-- a language you should learn as an intellectual
exercise, even though you won&apos;t actually use it:
<blockquote>
  Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience
  you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make
  you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you
  never actually use Lisp itself a lot.
</blockquote>
If I didn&apos;t know Lisp, reading this would set me asking questions.
A language that would make me a better programmer, if it means
anything at all, means a language that would be better for programming.
And that is in fact the implication of what Eric is saying.<br><br>As long as that idea is still floating around, I think hackers will
be receptive enough to a new Lisp, even if it is called Lisp. But
this Lisp must be a hacker&apos;s language, like the classic Lisps of
the 1970s. It must be terse, simple, and hackable. And it must have
powerful libraries for doing what hackers want to do now.<br><br>In the matter of libraries I think there is room to beat languages
like Perl and Python at their own game. A lot of the new applications
that will need to be written in the coming years will be 
<a href="road.html">server-based
applications</a>. There&apos;s no reason a new Lisp shouldn&apos;t have string
libraries as good as Perl, and if this new Lisp also had powerful
libraries for server-based applications, it could be very popular.
Real hackers won&apos;t turn up their noses at a new tool that will let
them solve hard problems with a few library calls. Remember, hackers
are lazy.<br><br>It could be an even bigger win to have core language support for
server-based applications. For example, explicit support for programs
with multiple users, or data ownership at the level of type tags.<br><br>Server-based applications also give us the answer to the question
of what this new Lisp will be used to hack. It would not hurt to
make Lisp better as a scripting language for Unix. (It would be
hard to make it worse.) But I think there are areas where existing
languages would be easier to beat. I think it might be better to
follow the model of Tcl, and supply the Lisp together with a complete
system for supporting server-based applications. Lisp is a natural
fit for server-based applications. Lexical closures provide a way
to get the effect of subroutines when the ui is just a series of
web pages. S-expressions map nicely onto html, and macros are good
at generating it. There need to be better tools for writing
server-based applications, and there needs to be a new Lisp, and
the two would work very well together.<br><br><b>12 The Dream Language</b><br><br>By way of summary, let&apos;s try describing the hacker&apos;s dream language.
The dream language is 
<a href="taste.html">beautiful</a>, clean, and terse. It has an
interactive toplevel that starts up fast. You can write programs
to solve common problems with very little code.  Nearly all the
code in any program you write is code that&apos;s specific to your
application. Everything else has been done for you.<br><br>The syntax of the language is brief to a fault. You never have to
type an unnecessary character, or even to use the shift key much.<br><br>Using big abstractions you can write the first version of a program
very quickly. Later, when you want to optimize, there&apos;s a really
good profiler that tells you where to focus your attention. You
can make inner loops blindingly fast, even writing inline byte code
if you need to.<br><br>There are lots of good examples to learn from, and the language is
intuitive enough that you can learn how to use it from examples in
a couple minutes. You don&apos;t need to look in the manual much. The
manual is thin, and has few warnings and qualifications.<br><br>The language has a small core, and powerful, highly orthogonal
libraries that are as carefully designed as the core language. The
libraries all work well together; everything in the language fits
together like the parts in a fine camera. Nothing is deprecated,
or retained for compatibility. The source code of all the libraries
is readily available. It&apos;s easy to talk to the operating system
and to applications written in other languages.<br><br>The language is built in layers. The higher-level abstractions are
built in a very transparent way out of lower-level abstractions,
which you can get hold of if you want.<br><br>Nothing is hidden from you that doesn&apos;t absolutely have to be. The
language offers abstractions only as a way of saving you work,
rather than as a way of telling you what to do. In fact, the language
encourages you to be an equal participant in its design. You can
change everything about it, including even its syntax, and anything
you write has, as much as possible, the same status as what comes
predefined.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1]  Macros very close to the modern idea were proposed by Timothy
Hart in 1964, two years after Lisp 1.5 was released. What was
missing, initially, were ways to avoid variable capture and multiple
evaluation; Hart&apos;s examples are subject to both.<br><br>[2]  In <i>When the Air Hits Your Brain,</i> neurosurgeon Frank Vertosick
recounts a conversation in which his chief resident, Gary, talks
about the difference between surgeons and internists (&quot;fleas&quot;):
<blockquote>
  Gary and I ordered a large pizza and found an open booth. The
  chief lit a cigarette. &quot;Look at those goddamn fleas, jabbering
  about some disease they&apos;ll see once in their lifetimes. That&apos;s
  the trouble with fleas, they only like the bizarre stuff. They
  hate their bread and butter cases. That&apos;s the difference between
  us and the fucking fleas. See, we love big juicy lumbar disc
  herniations, but they hate hypertension....&quot;
</blockquote>
It&apos;s hard to think of a lumbar disc herniation as juicy (except
literally). And yet I think I know what they mean. I&apos;ve often had
a juicy bug to track down. Someone who&apos;s not a programmer would
find it hard to imagine that there could be pleasure in a bug.
Surely it&apos;s better if everything just works. In one way, it is.
And yet there is undeniably a grim satisfaction in hunting down
certain sorts of bugs.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/bepop.ps">Postscript Version</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html">Arc</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="langdes.html">Five Questions about Language Design</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">How to Become a Hacker</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.shiro.dreamhost.com/scheme/trans/being-popular-j.html">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="langdes">Five Questions about Language Design</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">May 2001
<p>
<i>(These are some notes I made
for a panel discussion on programming language design
at MIT on May 10, 2001.)</i><br><br><br><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2202_12135763" width="159" height="18" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br><br><b>1. Programming Languages Are for People.</b><br><br>Programming languages
are how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as
happy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we
have high level languages is because people can&apos;t deal with
machine language.  The point of programming
languages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being 
overwhelmed by a mass of detail.<br><br>Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal
than others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems
is designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning
a given distance with the least material.  The other end of the
spectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their
time thinking about human butts.<br><br>Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing
data through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing
bridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing
chairs: it&apos;s all about dealing with human weaknesses.<br><br>Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great
mathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us
than pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical
elegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.
But elegance is not an end in itself.<br><br>And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,
I don&apos;t mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.
In fact I think you ought to design for the 
<a href="design.html">best programmers</a>, but
even the best programmers have limitations.  I don&apos;t think anyone
would like programming in a language where all the variables were
the letter x with integer subscripts.<br><br><b>2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.</b><br><br>If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best
ones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a
lot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.<br><br>When languages are designed for other people, it&apos;s always a specific
group of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.
So you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most
extreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.<br><br>It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty
low-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that&apos;s
why hackers like it.<br><br>The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that
there are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be
so.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately
large percentage of the software.<br><br>I&apos;m interested in the question, how do you design a language that
the very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is
identical to the question, how do you design a good programming
language?, but even if it isn&apos;t, it is at least an interesting
question.<br><br><b>3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.</b><br><br>Many languages
(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude
of a governess: they try to prevent you from
doing things that they think aren&apos;t good for you.  I like the   
opposite approach: give the programmer as much
control as you can.<br><br>When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was
that it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages
I had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   
program, written in the language, and the two were very separate.
But in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those
that made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language
if I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.<br><br><b>4. Aim for Brevity.</b><br><br>Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.
But if you look into the hearts of hackers, you&apos;ll see that they
really love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly
of how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple
lines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really
love is worth paying attention to.<br><br>I think almost anything
you can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots
of library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;
the syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things
should be short.<br><br>And it&apos;s not only programs that should be short.  The manual should
be thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications
and reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  
yourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing
the things in the language that required so much explanation.<br><br><b>5. Admit What Hacking Is.</b><br><br>A lot of people wish that hacking was
mathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think
hacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is
related to physics, in the sense that architects have to design
buildings that don&apos;t fall down, but the actual goal of architects
is to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.<br><br>What hackers like to do is make great programs.
And I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it&apos;s
an admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work 
doesn&apos;t translate easily into the conventional intellectual
currency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as
worthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a
horrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper
about.<br><br><br><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2202_12136436" width="125" height="18" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br><br><b>1. How to Organize Big Libraries?</b><br><br>Libraries are becoming an
increasingly important component of programming languages.  They&apos;re
also getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer
to find the library function that will do what you want than it
would take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing
but make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in 
point.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize
libraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer
could guess what library call would do the right thing.<br><br><b>2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?</b><br><br>This is an open
problem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and
still don&apos;t know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural
to me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of 
Lisp&apos;s unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   
Whether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. 
</p><p align="left">
<b>3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?</b>
</p><p align="justif">
I think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written
in the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning
programs that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web
browser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some
new things.<br><br>One thing we&apos;ll need is support for the new way that server-based 
apps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a
year, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a
series of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten
releases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest
version.<br><br>You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?
Well, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be
changeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least
to know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.<br><br>Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based
software, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software
you can use something like continuation-passing style to get the
effect of <a href="lwba.html">subroutines</a> in the inherently 
stateless world of a Web
session.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,
if it was not too expensive.<br><br><b>4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?</b><br><br>I&apos;m not sure how
reasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    
do, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would
make as much of a difference as having first class functions or
recursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible
dream.  These things don&apos;t get discovered that often.  But I am always
looking.<br><br><br><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2202_12137035" width="179" height="18" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br><br><b>1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.</b><br><br>Writing application
programs used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop
software there is a big bias toward writing the application in the
same language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,
writing software pretty much meant writing software in C.
Eventually a tradition evolved:
application programs must not be written in unusual languages.  
And this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people
like managers and venture capitalists also learned it.<br><br>Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based
software you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands
this yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).
A few hackers understand it, and that&apos;s why we even hear
about new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We&apos;re not hearing
about Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows
apps.<br><br>What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming
languages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for
our work.<br><br><b>2. Speed Comes from Profilers.</b><br><br>Language designers, or at least
language implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast
code.  But I don&apos;t think this is what makes languages fast for users.
Knuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical
bottlenecks.  And anyone who&apos;s tried it knows that you can&apos;t guess
where these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.<br><br>Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don&apos;t need
benchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show
them what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That&apos;s
where speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net 
win if language implementors took half the time they would
have spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a
good profiler instead.<br><br><b>3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.</b><br><br>This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages
all evolved together with some application they were being used to
write.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.
Lisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and
McCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation
programs even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.<br><br>It&apos;s especially good if your application solves some new problem.
That will tend to drive your language to have new features that   
programmers need.  I personally am interested in writing
a language that will be good for writing server-based applications.<br><br>[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the
additional suggestion that the application should not consist of
writing the compiler for your language, unless your language
happens to be intended for writing compilers.]<br><br><b>4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.</b><br><br>You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for
some limited task.  I think if you looked around you&apos;d find that  
a lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I
would not be surprised if <i>most</i> programs started as throwaway
programs.  And so if you want to make a language that&apos;s good for
writing software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway
programs, because that is the larval stage of most software.<br><br><b>5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.</b><br><br>It&apos;s traditional to think of
syntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will
sound shocking, but it may be that they aren&apos;t.
I think that what you want in your language may be related
to how you express it.<br><br>I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that
operator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix
syntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define
is effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a
new type of number you&apos;ve made up, you can just define a new function
to add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,
there&apos;s a big difference in appearance between the use of an
overloaded operator and a function call.<br><br><br><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2202_12137782" width="254" height="18" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br><br><b>1. New Programming Languages.</b><br><br>Back in the 1970s
it was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently
it hasn&apos;t been.  But I think server-based software will make new  
languages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can
use any language you want, so if someone does design a language that
actually seems better than others that are available, there will be
people who take a risk and use it.<br><br><b>2. Time-Sharing.</b><br><br>Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time
has come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.
My guess (and Microsoft&apos;s guess, it seems) is that much computing
will move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  
time-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support
for it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard
and Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  
scheduling within Scheme 48.<br><br><b>3. Efficiency.</b><br><br>Recently it was starting to seem that computers
were finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear
about byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have
cycles to spare.  But I don&apos;t think we will, with server-based
software.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that
the software runs on, and the number of users they can support per
machine will be the divisor of their capital cost.<br><br>So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational
bottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,
because server-based applications do a lot of i/o.<br><br>It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and
Microsoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte
codes at the moment.  But they&apos;re doing it because byte code is a
convenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because
byte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this
whole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.<br><br><br><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2202_12138764" width="170" height="18" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br><br><b>1. Clients.</b><br><br>This is just a guess, but my guess is that
the winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.
Designing software that works on the assumption that everyone will 
have your client is like designing a society on the assumption that
everyone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but
you have to assume it will never happen.<br><br>I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some
kind of Web access, and all you&apos;ll be able to assume about them is
that they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a
browser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  
pilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able
to browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don&apos;t know.  
And I don&apos;t have to know if I bet on
everything just being on the server.  It&apos;s
just so much more robust to have all the 
<a href="road.html">brains on the server</a>.<br><br><b>2. Object-Oriented Programming.</b><br><br>I realize this is a
controversial one, but I don&apos;t think object-oriented programming
is such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds
of applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   
like window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don&apos;t
see why it ought to be the model for all programming.<br><br>I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented
programming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.
Something that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of
integers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of
scaffolding and hustle and bustle.<br><br>Another attraction of
object-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the
effect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp
programmers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can
just use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,
instead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.<br><br>What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn&apos;t
build object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the
answer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design
whatever object systems they want as libraries.<br><br><b>3. Design by Committee.</b><br><br>Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  
and not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone
knows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  
But I think a greater danger is that they won&apos;t take risks.
When one person is in charge he can take risks
that a committee would never agree on.<br><br>Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?
Many people might suspect
that language design is something where you should stick fairly
close to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn&apos;t true.
In everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.

<i>(I wrote this article to help myself understand exactly
what McCarthy discovered.  You don&apos;t need to know this stuff
to program in Lisp, but it should be helpful to 
anyone who wants to
understand the essence of Lisp-- both in the sense of its
origins and its semantic core.  The fact that it has such a core
is one of Lisp&apos;s distinguishing features, and the reason why,
unlike other languages, Lisp has dialects.)</i><br><br>In 1960, <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/index.html">John 
McCarthy</a> published a remarkable paper in
which he did for programming something like what Euclid did for
geometry. He showed how, given a handful of simple
operators and a notation for functions, you can
build a whole programming language.
He called this language Lisp, for &quot;List Processing,&quot;
because one of his key ideas was to use a simple
data structure called a <i>list</i> for both
code and data.<br><br>It&apos;s worth understanding what McCarthy discovered, not
just as a landmark in the history of computers, but as
a model for what programming is tending to become in
our own time.  It seems to me that there have been
two really clean, consistent models of programming so
far: the C model and the Lisp model.
These two seem points of high ground, with swampy lowlands
between them.  As computers have grown more powerful,
the new languages being developed have been <a href="diff.html">moving
steadily</a> toward the Lisp model.  A popular recipe
for new programming languages in the past 20 years 
has been to take the C model of computing and add to
it, piecemeal, parts taken from the Lisp model,
like runtime typing and garbage collection.<br><br>In this article I&apos;m going to try to explain in the
simplest possible terms what McCarthy discovered.
The point is not just to learn about an interesting
theoretical result someone figured out forty years ago,
but to show where languages are heading.
The unusual thing about Lisp-- in fact, the defining
quality of Lisp-- is that it can be written in
itself.  To understand what McCarthy meant by this,
we&apos;re going to retrace his steps, with his mathematical
notation translated into running Common Lisp code.<br><br><br clear="all"></p></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/jmc.ps">Complete Article (Postscript)</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="4" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="diff.html">What Made Lisp Different</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="4" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/jmc.lisp">The Code</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="4" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://daiyuwen.freeshell.org/gb/rol/roots_of_lisp.html">Chinese Translation</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="4" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/lionfan/20070202">Japanese Translation</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="4" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.ciul.ul.pt/~tca/pdf/rootsoflisp.pdf">Portuguese Translation</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="4" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://blog.java2game.com/270">Korean Translation</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="4" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="road">The Other Road Ahead</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">September 2001<br><br><i>
(This article explains why much of the next generation of software
may be server-based, what that will mean for programmers,
and why this new kind of software is a great opportunity for startups.
It&apos;s derived from a talk at BBN Labs.)
</i><br><br>In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I decided to
start a startup.  The PR campaign leading up to Netscape&apos;s IPO was
running full blast then, and there was a lot of talk in the press
about online commerce.  At the time there might have been thirty
actual stores on the Web, all made by hand.  If there were going
to be a lot of online stores, there would need to be software for making
them, so we decided to write some.<br><br>For the first week or so we intended to make this an ordinary   
desktop application.  Then one day we had the idea of making the
software run on our Web server, using the browser as an
interface.  We tried rewriting the software to work over
the Web, and it was clear that this was the way to go.
If we wrote our software to run on the server, it would be a lot easier
for the users and for us as well.<br><br>This turned out to be a good plan.  Now, as 
<a href="http://store.yahoo.com">Yahoo Store</a>, this
software is the most popular online store builder, with
about 14,000 users.<br><br>When we started Viaweb, hardly anyone understood what we meant when
we said that the software ran on the server.  It was not until
Hotmail was launched a year later that people started to get it.
Now everyone knows that this is a valid approach.  There is
a name now for what we were: an Application Service Provider,
or ASP.<br><br>I think that a lot of the next generation of software will be
written on this model.  Even Microsoft, who have the most to
lose, seem to see the inevitablity of moving some things off
the desktop. If software moves
off the desktop and onto servers, it will mean a very different
world for developers.  This article describes the surprising
things we saw, as some of the first visitors to this new world.
To the extent software does move onto
servers, what I&apos;m describing here is the future.<br><br><b>The Next Thing?</b><br><br>When we look back on the desktop software era, I think we&apos;ll marvel
at the inconveniences people put up with, just as we marvel now at
what early car owners put up with.  For the first twenty or thirty
years, you had to be a car expert to own a car.  But cars were such
a big win that lots of people who weren&apos;t car experts wanted to
have them as well.<br><br>Computers are in this phase now.  When you own a desktop computer,
you end up learning a lot more than you wanted to know about what&apos;s
happening inside it.  But more than half the households in the US
own one.  My mother has a computer that she uses for email and for
keeping accounts.  About a year ago she was alarmed to receive a
letter from Apple, offering her a discount on a new version of the
operating system.  There&apos;s something wrong when a sixty-five year
old woman who wants to use a computer for email and accounts has
to think about installing new operating systems.  Ordinary users
shouldn&apos;t even know the words &quot;operating system,&quot; much less &quot;device
driver&quot; or &quot;patch.&quot;<br><br>There is now another way to deliver software that will save users
from becoming system administrators.  Web-based applications are
programs that run on Web servers and use Web pages as the user
interface.  For the average user this new kind of software will be
easier, cheaper, more mobile, more reliable, and often more powerful
than desktop software.<br><br>With Web-based software, most users won&apos;t have to think about
anything except the applications they use.  All the messy, changing
stuff will be sitting on a server somewhere, maintained by the kind
of people who are good at that kind of thing.  And so you won&apos;t
ordinarily need a computer, per se, to use software.  All you&apos;ll
need will be something with a keyboard, a screen, and a Web browser.
Maybe it will have wireless Internet access.  Maybe it will also
be your cell phone.  Whatever it is, it will be consumer electronics:
something that costs about $200, and that people choose mostly
based on how the case looks.  You&apos;ll pay more for Internet services
than you do for the hardware, just as you do now with telephones. [1]<br><br>It will take about a tenth of a second for a click to get to the
server and back, so users of heavily interactive software, like
Photoshop, will still want to have the computations happening on
the desktop.  But if you look at the kind of things most people
use computers for, a tenth of a second latency would not be a
problem.  My mother doesn&apos;t really need a desktop computer, and
there are a lot of people like her.<br><br><b>The Win for Users</b><br><br>Near my house there is a car with a bumper sticker that reads &quot;death
before inconvenience.&quot;  Most people, most of the time, will take
whatever choice requires least work.  If Web-based software wins,
it will be because it&apos;s more convenient.  And it looks as if it
will be, for users and developers both.<br><br>To use a purely Web-based application, all you need is a browser
connected to the Internet.  So you can use a Web-based application
anywhere.  When you install software on your desktop computer, you
can only use it on that computer.  Worse still, your files are
trapped on that computer.  The inconvenience of this model becomes
more and more evident as people get used to networks.<br><br>The thin end of the wedge here was Web-based email.  Millions of
people now realize that you should have access to email messages
no matter where you are.  And if you can see your email, why not
your calendar?  
If you can discuss a document with your colleagues,
why can&apos;t you edit it?  Why should any of your data be trapped on
some computer sitting on a faraway desk?<br><br>The whole idea of &quot;your computer&quot; is going away, and being replaced
with &quot;your data.&quot;  You should be able to get at your data from any
computer.  Or rather, any client, and a client doesn&apos;t have to be
a computer.<br><br>Clients shouldn&apos;t store data; they should be like telephones.  In
fact they may become telephones, or vice versa.  And as clients
get smaller, you have another reason not to keep your data on them:
something you carry around with you can be lost or stolen.   Leaving
your PDA in a taxi is like a disk crash, except that your data is
handed to <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/business/0,39020645,2077931,00.htm">someone else</a> 
instead of being vaporized.<br><br>With purely Web-based software, neither your data nor the applications
are kept on the client.  So you don&apos;t have to install anything to
use it.  And when there&apos;s no installation, you don&apos;t have to worry
about installation going wrong.  There can&apos;t be incompatibilities
between the application and your operating system, because the
software doesn&apos;t run on your operating system.<br><br>Because it needs no installation, it will be easy, and common, to
try Web-based software before you &quot;buy&quot; it.  You should expect to
be able to test-drive any Web-based application for free, just by
going to the site where it&apos;s offered.  At Viaweb our whole site
was like a big arrow pointing users to the test drive.<br><br>After trying the demo, signing up for the service should require
nothing more than filling out a brief form (the briefer the better).
And that should be the last work the user has to do.  With Web-based
software, you should get new releases without paying extra, or
doing any work, or possibly even knowing about it.<br><br>Upgrades won&apos;t be the big shocks they are now.  Over time applications
will quietly grow more powerful.  This will take some effort on
the part of the developers.  They will have to design software so
that it can be updated without confusing the users.  That&apos;s a new
problem, but there are ways to solve it.<br><br>With Web-based applications, everyone uses the same version, and
bugs can be fixed as soon as they&apos;re discovered.  So Web-based
software should have far fewer bugs than desktop software.  At
Viaweb, I doubt we ever had ten known bugs at any one time.  That&apos;s
orders of magnitude better than desktop software.<br><br>Web-based applications can be used by several people at the same
time.  This is an obvious win for collaborative applications, but
I bet users will start to want this in most applications once they
realize it&apos;s possible.  It will often be useful to let two people
edit the same document, for example.  Viaweb let multiple users
edit a site simultaneously, more because that was the right way to
write the software than because we expected users to want to, but
it turned out that many did.<br><br>When you use a Web-based application, your data will be safer.
Disk crashes won&apos;t be a thing of the past, but users won&apos;t hear
about them anymore.  They&apos;ll happen within server farms.  And
companies offering Web-based applications will actually do backups--
not only because they&apos;ll have real system administrators worrying
about such things, but because an ASP that does lose people&apos;s data
will be in big, big trouble.  When people lose their own data in
a disk crash, they can&apos;t get that mad, because they only have
themselves to be mad at.  When a company loses their data for them,
they&apos;ll get a lot madder.<br><br>Finally, Web-based software should be less vulnerable to viruses.
If the client doesn&apos;t run anything except a browser, there&apos;s less
chance of running viruses, and no data locally to damage.  And a
program that attacked the servers themselves should find them very
well defended. [2]<br><br>For users, Web-based software will be <i>less stressful.</i>  I think if
you looked inside the average Windows user you&apos;d find a huge and
pretty much untapped desire for software meeting that description.
Unleashed, it could be a powerful force.<br><br><b>City of Code</b><br><br>To developers, the most conspicuous difference between Web-based
and desktop software is that a Web-based application is not a single
piece of code.  It will be a collection of programs of different
types rather than a single big binary.  And so designing Web-based
software is like desiging a city rather than a building: as well
as buildings you need roads, street signs, utilities, police and
fire departments, and plans for both growth and various kinds of
disasters.<br><br>At Viaweb, software included fairly big applications that users
talked to directly, programs that those programs used, programs
that ran constantly in the background looking for problems, programs
that tried to restart things if they broke, programs that ran
occasionally to compile statistics or build indexes for searches,
programs we ran explicitly to garbage-collect resources or to move
or restore data, programs that pretended to be users (to measure
performance or expose bugs), programs for diagnosing network
troubles, programs for doing backups, interfaces to outside services,
software that drove an impressive collection of dials displaying
real-time server statistics (a hit with visitors, but indispensable
for us too), modifications (including bug fixes) to open-source
software, and a great many configuration files and settings.  Trevor
Blackwell wrote a spectacular program for moving stores to new
servers across the country, without shutting them down, after we
were bought by Yahoo. Programs paged us, sent faxes and email to
users, conducted transactions with credit card processors, and
talked to one another through sockets, pipes, http requests, ssh,
udp packets, shared memory, and files.  Some of Viaweb even consisted
of the absence of programs, since one of the keys to Unix security
is not to run unnecessary utilities that people might use to break
into your servers.<br><br>It did not end with software.  We spent a lot of time thinking
about server configurations.  We built the servers ourselves, from
components-- partly to save money, and partly to get exactly what
we wanted.  We had to think about whether our upstream ISP had fast
enough connections to all the backbones.  We serially  
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=6hdipo%243o0%241%40FreeBSD.csie.NCTU.edu.tw">dated</a>
RAID suppliers.<br><br>But hardware is not just something to worry about.  When you control
it you can do more for users.  With a desktop application, you can
specify certain minimum hardware, but you can&apos;t add more.  If you
administer the servers, you can in one step enable all your users
to page people, or send faxes, or send commands by phone, or process
credit cards, etc, just by installing the relevant hardware.  We
always looked for new ways to add features with hardware, not just
because it pleased users, but also as a way to distinguish ourselves
from competitors who (either because they sold desktop software,
or resold Web-based applications through ISPs) didn&apos;t have direct
control over the hardware.<br><br>Because the software in a Web-based application will be a collection
of programs rather than a single binary, it can be written in any
number of different languages.  When you&apos;re writing desktop software,
you&apos;re practically forced to write the application in the same
language as the underlying operating system-- meaning C and C++.
And so these languages (especially among nontechnical people like
managers and VCs) got to be considered as the languages for &quot;serious&quot;
software development.  But that was just an artifact of the way
desktop software had to be delivered.  For server-based software
you can use any language you want. [3]  Today a lot of the top
hackers are using languages far removed from C and C++:  Perl,
Python, and even Lisp.<br><br>With server-based software, no one can tell you what language to
use, because you control the whole system, right down to the
hardware.  Different languages are good for different tasks.  You
can use whichever is best for each.  And when you have competitors,
&quot;you can&quot; means &quot;you must&quot; (we&apos;ll return to this later), because
if you don&apos;t take advantage of this possibility, your competitors
will.<br><br>Most of our competitors used C and C++, and this made their software
visibly inferior because (among other things), they had no way
around the statelessness of CGI scripts.  If you were going to
change something, all the changes had to happen on one page, with
an Update button at the bottom.  As I&apos;ve written elsewhere, by
using <a href="avg.html">Lisp</a>, which many people still consider 
a research language,
we could make the Viaweb editor behave more like desktop software.<br><br><b>Releases</b><br><br>One of the most important changes in this new world is the way you
do releases. In the desktop software business, doing a release is
a huge trauma, in which the whole company sweats and strains to
push out a single, giant piece of code.  Obvious comparisons suggest
themselves, both to the process and the resulting product.<br><br>With server-based software, you can make changes almost as you
would in a program you were writing for yourself.  You release
software as a series of incremental changes instead of an occasional
big explosion. A typical desktop software company might do one or
two releases a year.  At Viaweb we often did three to five releases
a day.<br><br>When you switch to this new model, you realize how much software
development is affected by the way it is released.  Many of the
nastiest problems you see in the desktop software business are due
to catastrophic nature of releases.<br><br>When you release only one new version a year, you tend to deal with
bugs wholesale.  Some time before the release date you assemble a
new version in which half the code has been torn out and replaced,
introducing countless bugs.  Then a squad of QA people step in and
start counting them, and the programmers work down the list, fixing
them.  They do not generally get to the end of the list, and indeed,
no one is sure where the end is.  It&apos;s like fishing rubble out of
a pond.  You never really know what&apos;s happening inside the software.
At best you end up with a statistical sort of correctness.<br><br>With server-based software, most of the change is small and
incremental.  That in itself is less likely to introduce bugs.  It
also means you know what to test most carefully when you&apos;re about
to release software: the last thing you changed.  You end up with
a much firmer grip on the code.  As a general rule, you do know
what&apos;s happening inside it.  You don&apos;t have the source code memorized,
of course, but when you read the source you do it like a pilot
scanning the instrument panel, not like a detective trying to
unravel some mystery.<br><br>Desktop software breeds a certain fatalism about bugs.  You know
that you&apos;re shipping something loaded with bugs, and you&apos;ve even
set up mechanisms to compensate for it (e.g. patch releases).  So
why worry about a few more?  Soon you&apos;re releasing whole features
you know are broken.  
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1006-200-5195914.html">Apple</a> 
did this earlier this year.  They felt
under pressure to release their new OS, whose release date had
already slipped four times, but some of the software (support for
CDs and DVDs) wasn&apos;t ready. The solution?  They released the OS
without the unfinished parts, and users will have to install them
later.<br><br>With Web-based software, you never have to release software before
it works, and you can release it as soon as it does work.<br><br>The industry veteran may be thinking, it&apos;s a fine-sounding idea to
say that you never have to release software before it works, but
what happens when you&apos;ve promised to deliver a new version of your
software by a certain date?  With Web-based software, you wouldn&apos;t
make such a promise, because there are no versions.  Your software
changes gradually and continuously.  Some changes might be bigger
than others, but the idea of versions just doesn&apos;t naturally fit
onto Web-based software.<br><br>If anyone remembers Viaweb this might sound odd, because we were
always announcing new versions.  This was done entirely for PR
purposes.  The trade press, we learned, thinks in version numbers.
They will give you major coverage for a major release, meaning a
new first digit on the version number, and generally a paragraph
at most for a point release, meaning a new digit after the decimal
point.<br><br>Some of our competitors were offering desktop software and actually
had version numbers.  And for these releases, the mere fact of
which seemed to us evidence of their backwardness, they would get
all kinds of publicity.  We didn&apos;t want to miss out, so we started
giving version numbers to our software too.  When we wanted some
publicity, we&apos;d make a list of all the features we&apos;d added since
the last &quot;release,&quot; stick a new version number on the software,
and issue a press release saying that the new version was available
immediately.  Amazingly, no one ever called us on it.<br><br>By the time we were bought, we had done this three times, so we
were on Version 4.  Version 4.1 if I remember correctly.  After
Viaweb became Yahoo Store, there was no longer such a desperate
need for publicity, so although the software continued to evolve,
the whole idea of version numbers was quietly dropped.<br><br><b>Bugs</b><br><br>The other major technical advantage of Web-based software is that
you can reproduce most bugs.  You have the users&apos; data right there
on your disk.  If someone breaks your software, you don&apos;t have to
try to guess what&apos;s going on, as you would with desktop software:
you should be able to reproduce the error while they&apos;re on the
phone with you.  You might even know about it already, if you have
code for noticing errors built into your application.<br><br>Web-based software gets used round the clock, so everything you do
is immediately put through the wringer.  Bugs turn up quickly.<br><br>Software companies are sometimes accused of letting the users debug
their software.  And that is just what I&apos;m advocating.  For Web-based
software it&apos;s actually a good plan, because the bugs are fewer and
transient.  When you release software gradually you get far fewer
bugs to start with.  And when you can reproduce errors and release
changes instantly, you can find and fix most bugs as soon as they
appear.  We never had enough bugs at any one time to bother with
a formal bug-tracking system.<br><br>You should test changes before you release them, of course, so no
major bugs should get released.  Those few that inevitably slip
through will involve borderline cases and will only affect the few
users that encounter them before someone calls in to complain.  As
long as you fix bugs right away, the net effect, for the average
user, is far fewer bugs.  I doubt the average Viaweb user ever saw
a bug.<br><br>Fixing fresh bugs is easier than fixing old ones.  It&apos;s usually
fairly quick to find a bug in code you just wrote.  When it turns
up you often know what&apos;s wrong before you even look at the source,
because you were already worrying about it subconsciously. Fixing
a bug in something you wrote six months ago (the average case if
you release once a year) is a lot more work.  And since you don&apos;t
understand the code as well, you&apos;re more likely to fix it in an
ugly way, or even introduce more bugs. [4]<br><br>When you catch bugs early, you also get fewer compound bugs.
Compound bugs are two separate bugs that interact:  you trip going
downstairs, and when you reach for the handrail it comes off in
your hand.  In software this kind of bug is the hardest to find,
and also tends to have the worst consequences. [5]  The traditional
&quot;break everything and then filter out the bugs&quot; approach inherently
yields a lot of compound bugs.  And software that&apos;s released in a
series of small changes inherently tends not to. The floors are
constantly being swept clean of any loose objects that might later
get stuck in something.<br><br>It helps if you use a technique called functional programming.
Functional programming means avoiding side-effects.  It&apos;s something
you&apos;re more likely to see in research papers than commercial
software, but for Web-based applications it turns out to be really
useful.  It&apos;s hard to write entire programs as purely functional
code, but you can write substantial chunks this way.  It makes
those parts of your software easier to test, because they have no
state, and that is very convenient in a situation where you are
constantly making and testing small modifications.  I wrote much
of Viaweb&apos;s editor in this style, and we made our scripting language,
<a href="http://store.yahoo.com/rtml.html">RTML</a>, 
a purely functional language.<br><br>People from the desktop software business will find this hard to
credit, but at Viaweb bugs became almost a game.  Since most released
bugs involved borderline cases, the users who encountered them were
likely to be advanced users, pushing the envelope.  Advanced users
are more forgiving about bugs, especially since you probably
introduced them in the course of adding some feature they were
asking for.  In fact, because bugs were rare and you had to be
doing sophisticated things to see them, advanced users were often
proud to catch one.  They would call support in a spirit more of
triumph than anger, as if they had scored points off us.<br><br><b>Support</b><br><br>When you can reproduce errors, it changes your approach to customer
support.  At most software companies, support is offered as a way
to make customers feel better.  They&apos;re either calling you about
a known bug, or they&apos;re just doing something wrong and you have to
figure out what.  In either case there&apos;s not much you can learn
from them.  And so you tend to view support calls as a pain in the
ass that you want to isolate from your developers as much as
possible.<br><br>This was not how things worked at Viaweb.  At Viaweb, support was
free, because we wanted to hear from customers.  If someone had a
problem, we wanted to know about it right away so that we could
reproduce the error and release a fix.<br><br>So at Viaweb the developers were always in close contact with
support.  The customer support people were about thirty feet away
from the programmers, and knew that they could always interrupt
anything with a report of a genuine bug.  We would leave a board
meeting to fix a serious bug.<br><br>Our approach to support made everyone happier.  The customers were
delighted.  Just imagine how it would feel to call a support line
and be treated as someone bringing important news.  The customer
support people liked it because it meant they could help the users,
instead of reading scripts to them.  And the programmers liked it
because they could reproduce bugs instead of just hearing vague
second-hand reports about them.<br><br>Our policy of fixing bugs on the fly changed the relationship
between customer support people and hackers.  At most software
companies, support people are underpaid human shields, and hackers
are little copies of God the Father, creators of the world.  Whatever
the procedure for reporting bugs, it is likely to be one-directional:
support people who hear about bugs fill out some form that eventually
gets passed on (possibly via QA) to programmers, who put it on
their list of things to do.  It was very different at Viaweb.
Within a minute of hearing about a bug from a customer, the support
people could be standing next to a programmer hearing him say &quot;Shit,
you&apos;re right, it&apos;s a bug.&quot; It delighted the support people to hear
that &quot;you&apos;re right&quot; from the hackers.  They used to bring us bugs
with the same expectant air as a cat bringing you a mouse it has
just killed.   It also made them more careful in judging the
seriousness of a bug, because now their honor was on the line.<br><br>After we were bought by Yahoo, the customer support people were
moved far away from the programmers.  It was only then that we
realized that they were effectively QA and to some extent marketing
as well.  In addition to catching bugs, they were the keepers of
the knowledge of vaguer, buglike things, like features that confused
users. [6]  They were also a kind of proxy focus group; we could
ask them which of two new features users wanted more, and they were
always right.<br><br><b>Morale</b><br><br>Being able to release software immediately is a big motivator.
Often as I was walking to work I would think of some change I wanted
to make to the software, and do it that day.  This worked for bigger
features as well.  Even if something was going to take two weeks
to write (few projects took longer), I knew I could see the effect
in the software as soon as it was done.<br><br>If I&apos;d had to wait a year for the next release, I would have shelved
most of these ideas, for a while at least.  The thing about ideas,
though, is that they lead to more ideas.  Have you ever noticed
that when you sit down to write something, half the ideas that end
up in it are ones you thought of while writing it?  The same thing
happens with software.  Working to implement one idea gives you
more ideas.  So shelving an idea costs you not only that delay in
implementing it, but also all the ideas that implementing it would
have led to.  In fact, shelving an idea probably even inhibits new
ideas: as you start to think of some new feature, you catch sight
of the shelf and think &quot;but I already have a lot of new things I
want to do for the next release.&quot;<br><br>What big companies do instead of implementing features is plan
them.  At Viaweb we sometimes ran into trouble on this account.
Investors and analysts would ask us what we had planned for the
future.  The truthful answer would have been, we didn&apos;t have any
plans.  We had general ideas about things we wanted to improve,
but if we knew how we would have done it already.  What were we
going to do in the next six months? Whatever looked like the biggest
win.  I don&apos;t know if I ever dared give this answer, but that was
the truth.  Plans are just another word for ideas on the shelf.
When we thought of good ideas, we implemented them.<br><br>At Viaweb, as at many software companies, most code had one definite
owner.  But when you owned something you really owned it: no one
except the owner of a piece of software had to approve (or even
know about) a release.  There was no protection against breakage
except the fear of looking like an idiot to one&apos;s peers, and that
was more than enough.  I may have given the impression that we just
blithely plowed forward writing code.  We did go fast, but we
thought very carefully before we released software onto those
servers.  And paying attention is more important to reliability
than moving slowly.  Because he pays close attention, a Navy pilot
can land a 40,000 lb. aircraft at 140 miles per hour on a pitching
carrier deck, at night, more safely than the average teenager can
cut a bagel.<br><br>This way of writing software is a double-edged sword of course.
It works a lot better for a small team of good, trusted programmers
than it would for a big company of mediocre ones, where bad ideas
are caught by committees instead of the people that had them.<br><br><b>Brooks in Reverse</b><br><br>Fortunately, Web-based software does require fewer programmers.
I once worked for a medium-sized desktop software company that had
over 100 people working in engineering as a whole.  Only 13 of
these were in product development.  All the rest were working on
releases, ports, and so on.  With Web-based software, all you need
(at most) are the 13 people, because there are no releases, ports,
and so on.<br><br>Viaweb was written by just three people. [7]  I was always under
pressure to hire more, because we wanted to get bought, and we knew
that buyers would have a hard time paying a high price for a company
with only three programmers.  (Solution:  we hired more, but created
new projects for them.)<br><br>When you can write software with fewer programmers, it saves you
more than money.  As Fred Brooks pointed out in <i>The Mythical
Man-Month,</i> adding people to a project tends to slow it down.  The
number of possible connections between developers grows exponentially
with the size of the group.  The larger the group, the more time
they&apos;ll spend in meetings negotiating how their software will work
together, and the more bugs they&apos;ll get from unforeseen interactions.
Fortunately, this process also works in reverse: as groups get
smaller, software development gets exponentially more efficient.
I can&apos;t remember the programmers at Viaweb ever having an actual
meeting.  We never had more to say at any one time than we could
say as we were walking to lunch.<br><br>If there is a downside here, it is that all the programmers have
to be to some degree system administrators as well.  When you&apos;re
hosting software, someone has to be watching the servers, and in
practice the only people who can do this properly are the ones who
wrote the software.  At Viaweb our system had so many components
and changed so frequently that there was no definite border between
software and infrastructure.  Arbitrarily declaring such a border
would have constrained our design choices.  And so although we were
constantly hoping that one day (&quot;in a couple months&quot;) everything
would be stable enough that we could hire someone whose job was
just to worry about the servers, it never happened.<br><br>I don&apos;t think it could be any other way, as long as you&apos;re still
actively developing the product.  Web-based software is never going
to be something you write, check in, and go home.  It&apos;s a live
thing, running on your servers right now.  A bad bug might not just
crash one user&apos;s process; it could crash them all.  If a bug in
your code corrupts some data on disk, you have to fix it.  And so
on.  We found that you don&apos;t have to watch the servers every minute
(after the first year or so), but you definitely want to keep an
eye on things you&apos;ve changed recently.  You don&apos;t release code late
at night and then go home.<br><br><b>Watching Users</b><br><br>With server-based software, you&apos;re in closer touch with your code.
You can also be in closer touch with your users.  Intuit is famous
for introducing themselves to customers at retail stores and asking
to follow them home.  If you&apos;ve ever watched someone use your
software for the first time, you know what surprises must have
awaited them.<br><br>Software should do what users think it will.  But you can&apos;t have
any idea what users will be thinking, believe me, until you watch
them.  And server-based software gives you unprecedented information
about their behavior.  You&apos;re not limited to small, artificial
focus groups.  You can see every click made by every user.  You
have to consider carefully what you&apos;re going to look at, because
you don&apos;t want to violate users&apos; privacy, but even the most general
statistical sampling can be very useful.<br><br>When you have the users on your server, you don&apos;t have to rely on
benchmarks, for example.  Benchmarks are simulated users.  With
server-based software, you can watch actual users.  To decide what
to optimize, just log into a server and see what&apos;s consuming all
the CPU.  And you know when to stop optimizing too: we eventually
got the Viaweb editor to the point where it was memory-bound rather
than CPU-bound, and since there was nothing we could do to decrease
the size of users&apos; data (well, nothing easy), we knew we might as
well stop there.<br><br>Efficiency matters for server-based software, because you&apos;re paying
for the hardware.  The number of users you can support per server
is the divisor of your capital cost, so if you can make your software
very efficient you can undersell competitors and still make a
profit.  At Viaweb we got the capital cost per user down to about
$5.  It would be less now, probably less than the cost of sending
them the first month&apos;s bill.  Hardware is free now, if your software
is reasonably efficient.<br><br>Watching users can guide you in design as well as optimization.
Viaweb had a scripting language called RTML that let advanced users
define their own page styles.  We found that RTML became a kind of
suggestion box, because users only used it when the predefined page
styles couldn&apos;t do what they wanted.  Originally the editor put
button bars across the page, for example, but after a number of
users used RTML to put buttons down the left 
<a href="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_1656_3563">side</a>, 
we made that an
option (in fact the default) in the predefined page styles.<br><br>Finally, by watching users you can often tell when they&apos;re in
trouble.  And since the customer is always right, that&apos;s a sign of
something you need to fix.  At Viaweb the key to getting users was
the online test drive.  It was not just a series of slides built
by marketing people.  In our test drive, users actually used the
software.  It took about five minutes, and at the end of it they
had built a real, working store.<br><br><!--[The <a href="http://edit.store.yahoo.com/RT/SIGNUP-STORE">test drive</a> 
is still online, but now
they make you fill out several forms, and don't tell you
that you've created a working store.  If you try the test
drive, here is how to find your store: if you choose foo as your
store id, the finished store will be at store.yahoo.com/foo.]
-->
The test drive was the way we got nearly all our new users.  I
think it will be the same for most Web-based applications.   If
users can get through a test drive successfully, they&apos;ll like the
product.  If they get confused or bored, they won&apos;t.  So anything
we could do to get more people through the test drive would increase
our growth rate.<br><br>I studied click trails of people taking the test drive and found
that at a certain step they would get confused and click on the
browser&apos;s Back button.  (If you try writing Web-based applications,
you&apos;ll find that the Back button becomes one of your most interesting
philosophical problems.) So I added a message at that point, telling
users that they were nearly finished, and reminding them not to
click on the Back button.  Another great thing about Web-based
software is that you get instant feedback from changes:  the number
of people completing the test drive rose immediately from 60% to
90%.  And since the number of new users was a function of the number
of completed test drives, our revenue growth increased by 50%, just
from that change.<br><br><b>Money</b><br><br>In the early 1990s I read an article in which someone said that
software was a subscription business.  At first this seemed a very
cynical statement.  But later I realized that it reflects reality:
software development is an ongoing process.  I think it&apos;s cleaner
if you openly charge subscription fees, instead of forcing people
to keep buying and installing new versions so that they&apos;ll keep
paying you.  And fortunately, subscriptions are the natural way to
bill for Web-based applications.<br><br>Hosting applications is an area where companies will play a role
that is not likely to be filled by freeware.  Hosting applications
is a lot of stress, and has real expenses.  No one is going to want
to do it for free.<br><br>For companies, Web-based applications are an ideal source of revenue.
Instead of starting each quarter with a blank slate, you have a
recurring revenue stream.  Because your software evolves gradually,
you don&apos;t have to worry that a new model will flop; there never
need be a new model, per se, and if you do something to the software
that users hate, you&apos;ll know right away.  You have no trouble with
uncollectable bills; if someone won&apos;t pay you can just turn off
the service.  And there is no possibility of piracy.<br><br>That last &quot;advantage&quot; may turn out to be a problem.  Some amount
of piracy is to the advantage of software companies.  If some user
really would not have bought your software at any price, you haven&apos;t
lost anything if he uses a pirated copy.  In fact you gain, because
he is one more user helping to make your software the standard--
or who might buy a copy later, when he graduates from high school.<br><br>When they can, companies like to do something called price
discrimination, which means charging each customer as much as they
can afford. [8] Software is particularly suitable for price
discrimination, because the marginal cost is close to zero.  This
is why some software costs more to run on Suns than on Intel boxes:
a company that uses Suns is not interested in saving money and can
safely be charged more.  Piracy is effectively the lowest tier of
price discrimination.  I think that software companies understand
this and deliberately turn a blind eye to some kinds of piracy. [9] 
With server-based software they are going to have to come up with 
some other solution.<br><br>Web-based software sells well, especially in comparison to desktop
software, because it&apos;s easy to buy.  You might think that people
decide to buy something, and then buy it, as two separate steps.
That&apos;s what I thought before Viaweb, to the extent I thought about
the question at all.  In fact the second step can propagate back
into the first: if something is hard to buy, people will change
their mind about whether they wanted it.  And vice versa: you&apos;ll
sell more of something when it&apos;s easy to buy.  I buy more books
because Amazon exists.  Web-based software is just about the easiest
thing in the world to buy, especially if you have just done an
online demo.  Users should not have to do much more than enter a
credit card number.  (Make them do more at your peril.)<br><br>
Sometimes Web-based software is offered through ISPs acting as
resellers.  This is a bad idea.  You have to be administering the
servers, because you need to be constantly improving both hardware
and software.  If you give up direct control of the servers, you
give up most of the advantages of developing Web-based applications.<br><br>Several of our competitors shot themselves in the foot this way--
usually, I think, because they were overrun by suits who were
excited about this huge potential channel, and didn&apos;t realize that
it would ruin the product they hoped to sell through it.  Selling
Web-based software through ISPs is like selling sushi through
vending machines.<br><br><b>Customers</b><br><br>Who will the customers be?  At Viaweb they were initially individuals
and smaller companies, and I think this will be the rule with
Web-based applications.  These are the users who are ready to try
new things, partly because they&apos;re more flexible, and partly because
they want the lower costs of new technology.<br><br>Web-based applications will often be the best thing for big companies
too (though they&apos;ll be slow to realize it).  The best intranet is
the Internet.  If a company uses true Web-based applications, the
software will work better, the servers will be better administered,
and employees will have access to the system from anywhere.<br><br>The argument against this approach usually hinges on security: if
access is easier for employees, it will be for bad guys too.  Some
larger merchants were reluctant to use Viaweb because they thought
customers&apos; credit card information would be safer on their own
servers.  It was not easy to make this point diplomatically, but
in fact the data was almost certainly safer in our hands than
theirs.  Who can hire better people to manage security, a technology
startup whose whole business is running servers, or a clothing
retailer?  Not only did we have better people worrying about
security, we worried more about it.  If someone broke into the
clothing retailer&apos;s servers, it would affect at most one merchant,
could probably be hushed up, and in the worst case might get one
person fired.  If someone broke into ours, it could affect thousands
of merchants, would probably end up as news on CNet, and could put
us out of business.<br><br>If you want to keep your money safe, do you keep it under your
mattress at home, or put it in a bank? This argument applies to
every aspect of server administration:  not just security, but
uptime, bandwidth, load management, backups, etc.  Our existence
depended on doing these things right.  Server problems were the
big no-no for us, like a dangerous toy would be for a toy maker,
or a salmonella outbreak for a food processor.<br><br>A big company that uses Web-based applications is to that extent
outsourcing IT.  Drastic as it sounds, I think this is generally
a good idea.  Companies are likely to get better service this way
than they would from in-house system administrators.  System
administrators can become cranky and unresponsive because they&apos;re
not directly exposed to competitive pressure:  a salesman has to
deal with customers, and a developer has to deal with competitors&apos;
software, but a system administrator, like an old bachelor, has
few external forces to keep him in line. [10]  At Viaweb we had
external forces in plenty to keep us in line. The people calling
us were customers, not just co-workers.  If a server got wedged,
we jumped; just thinking about it gives me a jolt of adrenaline,
years later.<br><br>So Web-based applications will ordinarily be the right answer for
big companies too.  They will be the last to realize it, however,
just as they were with desktop computers.  And partly for the same
reason: it will be worth a lot of money to convince big companies
that they need something more expensive.<br><br>There is always a tendency for rich customers to buy expensive
solutions, even when cheap solutions are better, because the people
offering expensive solutions can spend more to sell them.  At Viaweb
we were always up against this.  We lost several high-end merchants
to Web consulting firms who convinced them they&apos;d be better off if
they paid half a million dollars for a custom-made online store on
their own server.  They were, as a rule, not better off, as more
than one discovered when Christmas shopping season came around and
loads rose on their server.  Viaweb was a lot more sophisticated
than what most of these merchants got, but we couldn&apos;t afford to
tell them.  At $300 a month, we couldn&apos;t afford to send a team of
well-dressed and authoritative-sounding people to make presentations
to customers.<br><br>A large part of what big companies pay extra for is the cost of
selling expensive things to them.  (If the Defense Department pays
a thousand dollars for toilet seats, it&apos;s partly because it costs
a lot to sell toilet seats for a thousand dollars.)  And this is
one reason intranet software will continue to thrive, even though
it is probably a bad idea.  It&apos;s simply more expensive.  There is
nothing you can do about this conundrum, so the best plan is to go
for the smaller customers first.  The rest will come in time.<br><br><b>Son of Server</b><br><br>Running software on the server is nothing new.  In fact it&apos;s the
old model: mainframe applications are all server-based.  If
server-based software is such a good idea, why did it lose last
time?  Why did desktop computers eclipse mainframes?<br><br>At first desktop computers didn&apos;t look like much of a threat.  The
first users were all hackers-- or hobbyists, as they were called
then.  They liked microcomputers because they were cheap.  For the
first time, you could have your own computer.  The phrase &quot;personal
computer&quot; is part of the language now, but when it was first used
it had a deliberately audacious sound, like the phrase &quot;personal
satellite&quot; would today.<br><br>Why did desktop computers take over? I think it was because they
had better software.  And I think the reason microcomputer software
was better was that it could be written by small companies.<br><br>I don&apos;t think many people realize how fragile and tentative startups
are in the earliest stage.  Many startups begin almost by accident--
as a couple guys, either with day jobs or in school, writing a
prototype of something that might, if it looks promising, turn into
a company. At this larval stage, any significant obstacle will stop
the startup dead in its tracks.  Writing mainframe software required
too much commitment up front.  Development machines were expensive,
and because the customers would be big companies, you&apos;d need an
impressive-looking sales force to sell it to them.  Starting a
startup to write mainframe software would be a much more serious
undertaking than just hacking something together on your Apple II
in the evenings.  And so you didn&apos;t get a lot of startups writing
mainframe applications.<br><br>The arrival of desktop computers inspired a lot of new software,
because writing applications for them seemed an attainable goal to
larval startups.  Development was cheap, and the customers would
be individual people that you could reach through computer stores
or even by mail-order.<br><br>The application that pushed desktop computers out into the mainstream
was <a href="http://www.bricklin.com/visicalc.htm">VisiCalc</a>, the 
first spreadsheet.  It was written by two guys
working in an attic, and yet did things no mainframe software could
do. [11]  VisiCalc was such an advance, in its time, that people
bought Apple IIs just to run it.  And this was the beginning of a
trend: desktop computers won because startups wrote software for
them.<br><br>It looks as if server-based software will be good this time around,
because startups will write it.  Computers are so cheap now that
you can get started, as we did, using a desktop computer as a
server.  Inexpensive processors have eaten the workstation market
(you rarely even hear the word now) and are most of the way through
the server market; Yahoo&apos;s servers, which deal with loads as high
as any on the Internet, all have the same inexpensive Intel processors
that you have in your desktop machine.  And once you&apos;ve written
the software, all you need to sell it is a Web site.  Nearly all
our users came direct to our site through word of mouth and references
in the press. [12]<br><br>Viaweb was a typical larval startup.  We were terrified of starting
a company, and for the first few months comforted ourselves by
treating the whole thing as an experiment that we might call off
at any moment.  Fortunately, there were few obstacles except
technical ones.  While we were writing the software, our Web server
was the same desktop machine we used for development, connected to
the outside world by a dialup line.  Our only expenses in that
phase were food and rent.<br><br>There is all the more reason for startups to write Web-based software
now, because writing desktop software has become a lot less fun.
If you want to write desktop software now you do it on Microsoft&apos;s
terms, calling their APIs and working around their buggy OS.  And
if you manage to write something that takes off, you may find that
you were merely doing market research for Microsoft.<br><br>If a company wants to make a platform that startups will build on,
they have to make it something that hackers themselves will want
to use.   That means it has to be inexpensive and well-designed.
The Mac was popular with hackers when it first came out, and a lot
of them wrote software for it. [13] You see this less with Windows,
because hackers don&apos;t use it.  The kind of people who are good at
writing software tend to be running Linux or FreeBSD now.<br><br>I don&apos;t think we would have started a startup to write desktop
software, because desktop software has to run on Windows, and before
we could write software for Windows we&apos;d have to use it.  The Web 
let us do an end-run around Windows, and deliver software running 
on Unix direct to users through the browser.  That is a liberating 
prospect, a lot like the arrival of PCs twenty-five years ago.<br><br><b>Microsoft</b><br><br>Back when desktop computers arrived, IBM was the giant that everyone
was afraid of.  It&apos;s hard to imagine now, but I remember the feeling
very well.  Now the frightening giant is Microsoft, and I don&apos;t
think they are as blind to the threat facing them as IBM was.
After all, Microsoft deliberately built their business in IBM&apos;s
blind spot.<br><br>I mentioned earlier that my mother doesn&apos;t really need a desktop
computer.  Most users probably don&apos;t.  That&apos;s a problem for Microsoft,
and they know it.  If applications run on remote servers, no one
needs Windows.  What will Microsoft do?  Will they be able to use
their control of the desktop to prevent, or constrain, this new
generation of software?<br><br>My guess is that Microsoft will develop some kind of server/desktop
hybrid, where the operating system works together with servers they
control.  At a minimum, files will be centrally available for users
who want that.  I don&apos;t expect Microsoft to go all the way to the
extreme of doing the computations on the server, with only a browser
for a client, if they can avoid it. If you only need a browser for
a client, you don&apos;t need Microsoft on the client, and if Microsoft
doesn&apos;t control the client, they can&apos;t push users towards their
server-based applications.<br><br>I think Microsoft will have a hard time keeping the genie in the
bottle.  There will be too many different types of clients for them
to control them all.  And if Microsoft&apos;s applications only work
with some clients, competitors will be able to trump them by offering
applications that work from any client. [14]<br><br>In a world of Web-based applications, there is no automatic place
for Microsoft.  They may succeed in making themselves a place, but
I don&apos;t think they&apos;ll dominate this new world as they did the world
of desktop applications.<br><br>It&apos;s not so much that a competitor will trip them up as that they
will trip over themselves.  With the rise of Web-based software,
they will be facing not just technical problems but their own
wishful thinking.  What they need to do is cannibalize their existing
business, and I can&apos;t see them facing that.  The same single-mindedness
that has brought them this far will now be working against them.
IBM was in exactly the same situation, and they could not master
it.  IBM made a late and half-hearted entry into the microcomputer
business because they were ambivalent about threatening their cash
cow, mainframe computing.  Microsoft will likewise be hampered by
wanting to save the desktop.  A cash cow can be a damned heavy
monkey on your back.<br><br>I&apos;m not saying that no one will dominate server-based applications.
Someone probably will eventually.  But I think that there will be
a good long period of cheerful chaos, just as there was in the
early days of microcomputers.  That was a good time for startups.
Lots of small companies flourished, and did it by making cool
things.<br><br><b>Startups but More So</b><br><br>The classic startup is fast and informal, with few people and little
money.  Those few people work very hard, and technology magnifies
the effect of the decisions they make.  If they win, they win big.<br><br>In a startup writing Web-based applications, everything you associate
with startups is taken to an extreme.  You can write and launch a
product with even fewer people and even less money.  You have to
be even faster, and you can get away with being more informal.
You can literally launch your product as three guys sitting in the
living room of an apartment, and a server collocated at an ISP.
We did.<br><br>Over time the teams have gotten smaller, faster, and more informal.
In 1960, software development meant a roomful of men with horn
rimmed glasses and narrow black neckties, industriously writing
ten lines of code a day on IBM coding forms.  In 1980, it was a
team of eight to ten people wearing jeans to the office and typing
into vt100s.  Now it&apos;s a couple of guys sitting in a living room
with laptops.  (And jeans turn out not to be the last word in
informality.)<br><br>Startups are stressful, and this, unfortunately, is also taken to
an extreme with Web-based applications.  
Many software companies, especially at the beginning, have periods
where the developers slept under their desks and so on.  The alarming
thing about Web-based software is that there is nothing to prevent
this becoming the default.  The stories about sleeping under desks
usually end:  then at last we shipped it and we all went home and
slept for a week.  Web-based software never ships.  You can work
16-hour days for as long as you want to.  And because you can, and
your competitors can, you tend to be forced to.  You can, so you
must.  It&apos;s Parkinson&apos;s Law running in reverse.<br><br>The worst thing is not the hours but the responsibility.  Programmers
and system administrators traditionally each have their own separate
worries.  Programmers have to worry about bugs, and system
administrators have to worry about infrastructure.  Programmers
may spend a long day up to their elbows in source code, but at some
point they get to go home and forget about it.  System administrators
never quite leave the job behind, but when they do get paged at
4:00 AM, they don&apos;t usually have to do anything very complicated.
With Web-based applications, these two kinds of stress get combined.
The programmers become system administrators, but without the
sharply defined limits that ordinarily make the job bearable.<br><br>At Viaweb we spent the first six months just writing software.  We
worked the usual long hours of an early startup.  In a desktop
software company, this would have been the part where we were
working hard, but it felt like a vacation compared to the next
phase, when we took users onto our server.  The second biggest
benefit of selling Viaweb to Yahoo (after the money) was to be able
to dump ultimate responsibility for the whole thing onto the
shoulders of a big company.<br><br>Desktop software forces users to become system administrators.
Web-based software forces programmers to.  There is less stress in
total, but more for the programmers.  That&apos;s not necessarily bad
news.  If you&apos;re a startup competing with a big company, it&apos;s good
news. [15]  Web-based applications offer a straightforward way to
outwork your competitors.  No startup asks for more.<br><br><b>Just Good Enough</b><br><br>One thing that might deter you from writing Web-based applications
is the lameness of Web pages as a UI.  That is a problem, I admit.
There were a few things we would have <i>really</i> liked to add to
HTML and HTTP.  What matters, though, is that Web pages are just
good enough.<br><br>There is a parallel here with the first microcomputers.  The
processors in those machines weren&apos;t actually intended to be the
CPUs of computers.  They were designed to be used in things like
traffic lights.  But guys like Ed Roberts, who designed the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800">Altair</a>,
realized that they were just good enough.  You could combine one
of these chips with some memory (256 bytes in the first Altair),
and front panel switches, and you&apos;d have a working computer.  Being
able to have your own computer was so exciting that there were
plenty of people who wanted to buy them, however limited.<br><br>Web pages weren&apos;t designed to be a UI for applications, but they&apos;re
just good enough.  And for a significant number of users, software
that you can use from any browser will be enough of a win in itself
to outweigh any awkwardness in the UI.  Maybe you can&apos;t write the
best-looking spreadsheet using HTML, but you can write a spreadsheet
that several people can use simultaneously from different locations
without special client software, or that can incorporate live data
feeds, or that can page you when certain conditions are triggered.
More importantly, you can write new kinds of applications that
don&apos;t even have names yet.  VisiCalc was not merely a microcomputer
version of a mainframe application, after all-- it was a new type
of application.<br><br>Of course, server-based applications don&apos;t have to be Web-based.
You could have some other kind of client.  But I&apos;m pretty sure
that&apos;s a bad idea.  It would be very convenient if you could assume
that everyone would install your client-- so convenient that you
could easily convince yourself that they all would-- but if they
don&apos;t, you&apos;re hosed.  Because Web-based software assumes nothing
about the client, it will work anywhere the Web works.  That&apos;s a
big advantage already, and the advantage will grow as new Web
devices proliferate.  Users will like you because your software
just works, and your life will be easier because you won&apos;t have to
tweak it for every new client.  <!-- I would not even use Javascript,
if I were you.  Viaweb didn't. --> [16]<br><br>I feel like I&apos;ve watched the evolution of the Web as closely as
anyone, and I can&apos;t predict what&apos;s going to happen with clients.
Convergence is probably coming, but where?  I can&apos;t pick a winner.
One thing I can predict is conflict between AOL and Microsoft.
Whatever Microsoft&apos;s .NET turns out to be, it will probably involve
connecting the desktop to servers.  Unless AOL fights back, they
will either be pushed aside or turned into a pipe between Microsoft
client and server software.  If Microsoft and AOL get into a client
war, the only thing sure to work on both will be browsing the Web,
meaning Web-based applications will be the only kind that work
everywhere.<br><br>How will it all play out?  I don&apos;t know.  And you don&apos;t have to
know if you bet on Web-based applications.  No one can break that
without breaking browsing.  The Web may not be the only way to
deliver software, but it&apos;s one that works now and will continue to
work for a long time.  Web-based applications are cheap to develop,
and easy for even the smallest startup to deliver.  They&apos;re a lot
of work, and of a particularly stressful kind, but that only makes
the odds better for startups.<br><br><b>Why Not?</b><br><br>E. B. White was amused to learn from a farmer friend that many
electrified fences don&apos;t have any current running through them.
The cows apparently learn to stay away from them, and after that
you don&apos;t need the current.  &quot;Rise up, cows!&quot; he wrote, &quot;Take your
liberty while despots snore!&quot;<br><br>If you&apos;re a hacker who has thought of one day starting a startup,
there are probably two things keeping you from doing it.  One is
that you don&apos;t know anything about business.  The other is that
you&apos;re afraid of competition.  Neither of these fences have any
current in them.<br><br>There are only two things you have to know about business:  build
something users love, and make more than you spend.  If you get
these two right, you&apos;ll be ahead of most startups.  You can figure
out the rest as you go.<br><br>You may not at first make more than you spend, but as long as the
gap is closing fast enough you&apos;ll be ok.  If you start out underfunded,
it will at least encourage a habit of frugality.  The less you
spend, the easier it is to make more than you spend.  Fortunately,
it can be very cheap to launch a Web-based application.  We launched
on under $10,000, and it would be even cheaper today.  We had to
spend thousands on a server, and thousands more to get SSL.  (The
only company selling SSL software at the time was Netscape.)  Now
you can rent a much more powerful server, with SSL included, for
less than we paid for bandwidth alone.  You could launch a Web-based
application now for less than the cost of a fancy office chair.<br><br>As for building something users love, here are some general tips.
Start by making something clean and simple that you would want to
use yourself.  Get a version 1.0 out fast, then continue to improve
the software, listening closely to the users as you do.  The customer
is always right, but different customers are right about different
things; the least sophisticated users show you what you need to
simplify and clarify, and the most sophisticated tell you what
features you need to add. The best thing software can be is easy,
but the way to do this is to get the defaults right, not to limit
users&apos; choices.  Don&apos;t get complacent if your competitors&apos; software
is lame; the standard to compare your software to is what it could
be, not what your current competitors happen to have.  Use your
software yourself, all the time.  Viaweb was supposed to be an
online store builder, but we used it to make our own site too.
Don&apos;t listen to marketing people or designers or product managers
just because of their job titles.  If they have good ideas, use
them, but it&apos;s up to you to decide; software has to be designed by
hackers who understand design, not designers who know a little
about software.  If you can&apos;t design software as well as implement
it, don&apos;t start a startup.<br><br>Now let&apos;s talk about competition.  What you&apos;re afraid of is not
presumably groups of hackers like you, but actual companies, with
offices and business plans and salesmen and so on, right?  Well,
they are more afraid of you than you are of them, and they&apos;re right.
It&apos;s a lot easier for a couple of hackers to figure out how to rent
office space or hire sales people than it is for a company of any
size to get software written.  I&apos;ve been on both sides, and I know.
When Viaweb was bought by Yahoo, I suddenly found myself working
for a big company, and it was like trying to run through waist-deep
water.<br><br>I don&apos;t mean to disparage Yahoo.  They had some good hackers, and
the top management were real butt-kickers.  For a big company, they
were exceptional.  But they were still only about a tenth as
productive as a small startup.  No big company can do much better
than that.  What&apos;s scary about Microsoft is that a company so
big can develop software at all.  They&apos;re like a mountain that
can walk.<br><br>Don&apos;t be intimidated.  You can do as much that Microsoft can&apos;t as
they can do that you can&apos;t.  And no one can stop you.  You don&apos;t
have to ask anyone&apos;s permission to develop Web-based applications.
You don&apos;t have to do licensing deals, or get shelf space in retail
stores, or grovel to have your application bundled with the OS.
You can deliver software right to the browser, and no one can get
between you and potential users without preventing them from browsing
the Web.<br><br>You may not believe it, but I promise you, Microsoft is scared of
you.  The complacent middle managers may not be, but Bill is,
because he was you once, back in 1975, the last time a new way of
delivering software appeared.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] Realizing that much of the money is in the services, companies
building lightweight clients have usually tried to combine the
hardware with an 
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1006-200-3622600.html">online service</a>. 
 This approach has not worked
well, partly because you need two different kinds of companies to
build consumer electronics and to run an online service, and partly
because users hate the idea.  Giving away the razor and making
money on the blades may work for Gillette, but a razor is much
smaller commitment than a Web terminal.  Cell phone handset makers
are satisfied to sell hardware without trying to capture the service
revenue as well.  That should probably be the model for Internet
clients too.  If someone just sold a nice-looking little box with
a Web browser that you could use to connect through any ISP, every
technophobe in the country would buy one.<br><br>[2] Security always depends more on not screwing up than any design
decision, but the nature of server-based software will make developers
pay more attention to not screwing up.  Compromising a server could
cause such damage that ASPs (that want to stay in business) are
likely to be careful about security.<br><br>[3] In 1995, when we started Viaweb, Java applets were supposed to
be the technology everyone was going to use to develop server-based
applications.  Applets seemed to us an old-fashioned idea.  Download
programs to run on the client? Simpler just to go all the way and
run the programs on the server.  We wasted little time
on applets, but countless other startups must have been lured into
this tar pit.  Few can have escaped alive, or Microsoft could not
have gotten away with dropping Java in the most recent version of
Explorer.<br><br>[4] This point is due to Trevor Blackwell, who adds &quot;the cost of
writing software goes up more than linearly with its size.  Perhaps
this is mainly due to fixing old bugs, and the cost can be more
linear if all bugs are found quickly.&quot;<br><br>[5] The hardest kind of bug to find may be a variant of compound
bug where one bug happens to compensate for another.  When you fix
one bug, the other becomes visible.  But it will seem as if the
fix is at fault, since that was the last thing you changed.<br><br>[6] Within Viaweb we once had a contest to describe the worst thing
about our software.  Two customer support people tied for first
prize with entries I still shiver to recall.  We fixed both problems
immediately.<br><br>[7] Robert Morris wrote the ordering system, which shoppers used
to place orders. Trevor Blackwell wrote the image generator and
the manager, which merchants used to retrieve orders, view statistics,
and configure domain names etc.  I wrote the editor, which merchants
used to build their sites.  The ordering system and image generator
were written in C and C++, the manager mostly in Perl, and the editor
in <a href="avg.html">Lisp</a>.<br><br>[8] Price discrimination is so pervasive (how often have you heard
a retailer claim that their buying power meant lower prices for
you?) that I was surprised to find it was outlawed in the U.S. by
the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936.  This law does not appear to be
vigorously enforced.<br><br>[9] In <i>No Logo,</i> Naomi Klein says that clothing brands favored by
&quot;urban youth&quot; do not try too hard to prevent shoplifting because
in their target market the shoplifters are also the fashion leaders.<br><br>[10] Companies often wonder what to outsource and what not to.
One possible answer: outsource any job that&apos;s not directly exposed
to competitive pressure, because outsourcing it will thereby expose
it to competitive pressure.<br><br>[11] The two guys were Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston.  Dan wrote
a prototype in Basic in a couple days, then over the course of the
next year they worked together (mostly at night) to make a more
powerful version written in 6502 machine language.  Dan was at
Harvard Business School at the time and Bob nominally had a day
job writing software.  &quot;There was no great risk in doing a business,&quot;
Bob wrote, &quot;If it failed it failed. No big deal.&quot;<br><br>[12] It&apos;s not quite as easy as I make it sound.  It took a painfully
long time for word of mouth to get going, and we did not start to
get a lot of press coverage until we hired a 
<a href="http://www.schwartz-pr.com">PR firm</a> 
(admittedly
the best in the business) for $16,000 per month.  However, it was
true that the only significant channel was our own Web site.<br><br>[13] If the Mac was so great, why did it lose?  Cost, again.
Microsoft concentrated on the software business, and unleashed a
swarm of cheap component suppliers on Apple hardware.  It did not
help, either, that suits took over during a critical period.<br><br>[14] One thing that would help Web-based applications, and help
keep the next generation of software from being overshadowed by
Microsoft, would be a good open-source browser.  Mozilla is
open-source but seems to have suffered from having been corporate
software for so long.  A small, fast browser that was actively
maintained would be a great thing in itself, and would probably
also encourage companies to build little Web appliances.<br><br>Among other things, a proper open-source browser would cause HTTP
and HTML to continue to evolve (as e.g. Perl has).  It would help
Web-based applications greatly to be able to distinguish between
selecting a link and following it; all you&apos;d need to do this would
be a trivial enhancement of HTTP, to allow multiple urls in a
request.  Cascading menus would also be good.<br><br>If you want to change the world, write a new Mosaic.  Think it&apos;s
too late?  In 1998 a lot of people thought it was too late to launch
a new search engine, but Google proved them wrong.  There is always
room for something new if the current options suck enough.  Make
sure it works on all the free OSes first-- new things start with
their users.<br><br>[15] Trevor Blackwell, who probably knows more about this from
personal experience than anyone, writes:<br><br>&quot;I would go farther in saying that because server-based software
is so hard on the programmers, it causes a fundamental economic
shift away from large companies. It requires the kind of intensity
and dedication from programmers that they will only be willing to
provide when it&apos;s their own company.  Software companies can hire
skilled people to work in a not-too-demanding environment, and can
hire unskilled people to endure hardships, but they can&apos;t hire
highly skilled people to bust their asses. Since capital is no
longer needed, big companies have little to bring to the table.&quot;<br><br>[16] In the original version of this essay, I advised avoiding
Javascript.  That was a good plan in 2001, but Javascript now works.
<!-- Most of the Javascript I see on the Web isn't necessary, and
much of it breaks.  (My mental picture of a Javascript programmer
is Wally from Dilbert, with a thought bubble over his head reading
"It works on my computer.") Yahoo uses Javascript in a few places,
though not many.  I once asked someone there how this worked out,
and he said "they ended up learning a <i>lot</i> about different browser
versions." Microsoft may start to embrace and extend Javascript,
or even can it, like Java.  And when you start to be able to browse
actual Web pages on your cell phone or PDA (or toaster), who knows
if they'll even support it? --><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sarah Harlin, Trevor Blackwell, Robert Morris, Eric Raymond, Ken Anderson,

May 2002)
<p align="justif">
<i>(This article came about in response to some questions on
the <a href="http://ll1.mit.edu">LL1</a> mailing list.  It is now
incorporated in <a href="icad.html">Revenge of the Nerds</a>.)</i><br><br>When McCarthy designed Lisp in the late 1950s, it was
a radical departure from existing languages,
the most important of which was <a href="history.html">Fortran</a>.<br><br>Lisp embodied nine new ideas:<br><br>
<b>1. Conditionals.</b>  A conditional is an if-then-else
construct.  We take these for granted now.  They were 
<a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/lisp/node2.html">invented</a>
by McCarthy in the course of developing Lisp. 
(Fortran at that time only had a conditional
goto, closely based on the branch instruction in the 
underlying hardware.)  McCarthy, who was on the Algol committee, got
conditionals into Algol, whence they spread to most other
languages.<br><br><b>2. A function type.</b> In Lisp, functions are first class 
objects-- they&apos;re a data type just like integers, strings,
etc, and have a literal representation, can be stored in variables,
can be passed as arguments, and so on.<br><br><b>3. Recursion.</b>  Recursion existed as a mathematical concept
before Lisp of course, but Lisp was the first programming language to support
it.  (It&apos;s arguably implicit in making functions first class
objects.)<br><br><b>4. A new concept of variables.</b>  In Lisp, all variables
are effectively pointers. Values are what
have types, not variables, and assigning or binding
variables means copying pointers, not what they point to.<br><br><b>5. Garbage-collection.</b><br><br><b>6. Programs composed of expressions.</b> Lisp programs are 
trees of expressions, each of which returns a value.  
(In some Lisps expressions
can return multiple values.)  This is in contrast to Fortran
and most succeeding languages, which distinguish between
expressions and statements.<br><br>It was natural to have this
distinction in Fortran because (not surprisingly in a language
where the input format was punched cards) the language was
line-oriented.  You could not nest statements.  And
so while you needed expressions for math to work, there was
no point in making anything else return a value, because
there could not be anything waiting for it.<br><br>This limitation
went away with the arrival of block-structured languages,
but by then it was too late. The distinction between
expressions and statements was entrenched.  It spread from 
Fortran into Algol and thence to both their descendants.<br><br>When a language is made entirely of expressions, you can
compose expressions however you want.  You can say either
(using <a href="arc.html">Arc</a> syntax)<br><br>(if foo (= x 1) (= x 2))<br><br>or<br><br>(= x (if foo 1 2))<br><br><b>7. A symbol type.</b>  Symbols differ from strings in that
you can test equality by comparing a pointer.<br><br><b>8. A notation for code</b> using trees of symbols.<br><br><b>9. The whole language always available.</b>  
There is
no real distinction between read-time, compile-time, and runtime.
You can compile or run code while reading, read or run code
while compiling, and read or compile code at runtime.<br><br>Running code at read-time lets users reprogram Lisp&apos;s syntax;
running code at compile-time is the basis of macros; compiling
at runtime is the basis of Lisp&apos;s use as an extension
language in programs like Emacs; and reading at runtime
enables programs to communicate using s-expressions, an
idea recently reinvented as XML.
<br><br>When Lisp was first invented, all these ideas were far
removed from ordinary programming practice, which was
dictated largely by the hardware available in the late 1950s.<br><br>Over time, the default language, embodied
in a succession of popular languages, has
gradually evolved toward Lisp.  1-5 are now widespread.
6 is starting to appear in the mainstream.
Python has a form of 7, though there doesn&apos;t seem to be
any syntax for it.  
8, which (with 9) is what makes Lisp macros
possible, is so far still unique to Lisp,
perhaps because (a) it requires those parens, or something 
just as bad, and (b) if you add that final increment of power, 
you can no 
longer claim to have invented a new language, but only
to have designed a new dialect of Lisp ; -)<br><br>Though useful to present-day programmers, it&apos;s
strange to describe Lisp in terms of its
variation from the random expedients other languages
adopted.  That was not, probably, how McCarthy
thought of it.  Lisp wasn&apos;t designed to fix the mistakes
in Fortran; it came about more as the byproduct of an
attempt to <a href="rootsoflisp.html">axiomatize computation</a>.<br><br><!-- Nor is this a complete list of ideas that began with Lisp
and spread to other languages.  These are only the initial
set.  Several more were developed in successive Lisp
implementations, including continuations, 
multiple return values, rest parameters,
and assignment (setf) inversion. --><br><br></p></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="413"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/lionfan/20070217">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="noop">Why Arc Isn&apos;t Especially Object-Oriented</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana"><p align="justif">
There is a kind of mania for object-oriented programming at the moment, but
<!-- it seems to peak with medium-quality programmers.  -->
some of the <a href="reesoo.html">smartest programmers</a> I know are some of the least excited about it.<br><br>My own feeling is that object-oriented
programming is a useful technique in some
cases, but it isn&apos;t something that has to pervade every program you
write.  You should be able to define new types,
but you shouldn&apos;t have to express every program as the
definition of new types.<br><br>I think there are five reasons people like object-oriented   
programming, and three and a half of them are bad:<br><br><ol>
<li> Object-oriented programming is exciting   
if you have a statically-typed language without 
lexical closures or macros.  To some degree, it offers a way around these
limitations.  (See <a href="quotes.html">Greenspun&apos;s Tenth Rule</a>.)<br><br></li><li> Object-oriented programming is popular in big companies,
because it suits the way they write software.  At big companies,
software tends to be written by large (and frequently changing)  
teams of
mediocre programmers.  Object-oriented programming imposes a
discipline on these programmers that prevents any one of them
from doing too much damage.  The price is that the resulting
code is bloated with protocols and full of duplication.  
This is not too high a price for big companies, because their
software is probably going to be bloated and full of 
duplication anyway.<br><br></li><li> Object-oriented
programming generates a lot of what looks like work.
Back in the days of fanfold, there was a type of programmer who
would only put five or ten lines of code on a page, preceded
by twenty lines of elaborately formatted comments. 
Object-oriented programming is like crack for these people: it lets
you incorporate all this scaffolding right into your source
code.  Something that a Lisp hacker might handle by pushing
a symbol onto a list becomes a whole file of classes and
methods.  So it is a good tool if you want to convince yourself,
or someone else, that you are doing a lot of work.<br><br></li><li> If a language is itself an object-oriented program, it can
be extended by users.  Well, maybe.  Or maybe you can do
even better by offering the sub-concepts
of object-oriented programming a la carte.  Overloading, 
for example, is not intrinsically tied to classes.  We&apos;ll see.<br><br></li><li> Object-oriented abstractions map neatly onto the domains
of  certain specific kinds of programs, like simulations and CAD
systems.                                        
</li></ol>
</p><p align="justif">
I personally have never needed object-oriented abstractions.
Common Lisp has an enormously powerful object system and I&apos;ve
never used it once.  I&apos;ve done a lot of things (e.g. making         
hash tables full of closures) that would have required 
object-oriented techniques to do in wimpier languages, but
I have never had to use CLOS.<br><br>Maybe I&apos;m just stupid, or have worked on some limited subset
of applications.  There is a danger in designing a language
based on one&apos;s own experience of programming.  But it seems
more dangerous to put stuff in that you&apos;ve never needed 
because it&apos;s thought to be a good idea.<br><br></p></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="reesoo.html">Rees Re: OO</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.cibercalli.com/erick/hackingnews/porque-arc-no-es-especialmente-orientado-a-objetos">Spanish Translation</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="taste">Taste for Makers</h1><a href="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2202_11569032"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2202_11605100" width="410" height="106" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a><br><br><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">February 2002<br><br><table width="500" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">

</td></tr></table><br><br>I was talking recently to a friend who teaches
at MIT.  His field is hot now and
every year he is inundated by applications from
would-be graduate students.  &quot;A lot of them seem smart,&quot;
he said.  &quot;What I can&apos;t tell is whether they have any kind
of taste.&quot;<br><br>Taste.  You don&apos;t hear that word much now.
And yet we still need the underlying
concept, whatever we call it.  What my friend meant was
that he wanted students who were not just good technicians,
but who could use their technical knowledge to
design beautiful things.<br><br>Mathematicians call good work &quot;beautiful,&quot;
and so, either now or in the past, have
scientists, engineers, musicians, architects, designers,
writers, and painters.
Is it just a coincidence that they used the same word, or is   
there some overlap in what they meant?  If there
is an overlap, can we use one field&apos;s discoveries
about beauty to help us in another?<br><br>For those of us who design things, these are not just
theoretical questions.  If there is such a thing as
beauty, we need to be able to recognize it.  We need
good taste to make good things.
Instead of
treating beauty as an airy abstraction, to be either blathered
about or avoided depending on how one feels about airy
abstractions, let&apos;s try considering it as a practical question:
<i>how do you make good stuff?</i><br><br><br><br>If you mention taste nowadays, a lot of people will tell
you that &quot;taste is subjective.&quot;
They believe this because it really feels that
way to them.  When they like something, they have no idea
why.  It could be because it&apos;s beautiful, or because their
mother had one, or because they saw a movie star with one
in a magazine, or because they know it&apos;s expensive.
Their thoughts are a tangle of unexamined impulses.<br><br>Most of us are encouraged, as children, to leave this tangle
unexamined.  If you make fun of your little brother for
coloring people green in his coloring book, your
mother is likely to tell you something like &quot;you like to
do it your way and he likes to do it his way.&quot;<br><br>Your mother at this point is not trying to teach you
important truths about aesthetics.  She&apos;s trying to get
the two of you to stop bickering.<br><br>Like many of the half-truths adults tell us, this one
contradicts other things they tell us.  After dinning
into you that taste is merely a matter of personal preference,
they take you to the museum and tell you that you should
pay attention because Leonardo is a great artist.<br><br>What goes through the kid&apos;s head at this point?  What does
he think &quot;great artist&quot; means?  After having been
told for years that everyone just likes to do
things their own way, he is
unlikely to head straight for the conclusion that a great
artist is someone whose work is <i>better</i> than the others&apos;.
A far more likely theory, in his Ptolemaic model of
the universe, is that a great artist is something that&apos;s
good for you, like broccoli, because someone said so in a book.<br><br><br><br>Saying that taste is just personal preference is a good way
to prevent disputes.  The trouble is, it&apos;s not true.
You feel this when you start to design things.<br><br>Whatever job people do, they naturally want to do better.
Football players
like to win games.  CEOs like to increase earnings.  It&apos;s
a matter of pride, and a real pleasure, to get better at
your job. But if
your job is to design things, and there is no such thing
as beauty, then there is <i>no way to get better at your job.</i>
If taste is just personal preference, then everyone&apos;s is   
already perfect: you like whatever you like, and that&apos;s it.<br><br>As in any job, as you continue to design things, you&apos;ll get
better at it.  Your tastes will change.  And, like anyone
who gets better at their job, you&apos;ll know you&apos;re getting
better.  If so,
your old tastes were
not merely different, but worse.  Poof goes the axiom that
taste can&apos;t be wrong.<br><br>Relativism is fashionable at the moment, and that may hamper
you from thinking about taste, even as yours grows.
But if you come out of the closet and admit, at least to yourself,
that there is such a thing as good and bad design, then you
can start to study good design in detail.
How has
your taste changed?  When you made mistakes, what
caused you to make them?  What have other people learned about
design?<br><br>Once you start to examine the question, it&apos;s surprising how
much different fields&apos; ideas of beauty have in common.  The same
principles of good design crop up again and again.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design is simple.</b>  You hear this from math to
painting.  In math it means that a shorter proof tends to be
a better one.  Where axioms are concerned, especially,
less is more.  It means much the same thing in programming.
For architects and designers it means that beauty should
depend on a few carefully chosen structural elements
rather than a profusion of superficial ornament.  (Ornament
is not in itself bad, only when it&apos;s camouflage on insipid
form.)  Similarly, in painting, a
still life of a few carefully observed and solidly
modelled objects will tend to be more interesting than a
stretch of flashy
but mindlessly repetitive painting of, say, a lace collar.
In writing it means: say what you mean
and say it briefly.<br><br>It seems strange to have to emphasize simplicity.
You&apos;d think simple would be the default.  Ornate
is more work.  But something seems to come over people
when they try to be creative.  Beginning writers adopt   
a pompous tone that doesn&apos;t sound anything like the way 
they speak.  Designers trying to be artistic resort to
swooshes and curlicues.  Painters discover that they&apos;re expressionists.
It&apos;s all evasion.
Underneath
the long words or the &quot;expressive&quot; brush strokes, there
is not much going on, and that&apos;s frightening.<br><br>When you&apos;re
forced to be simple, you&apos;re forced to face the real problem.
When you can&apos;t deliver ornament, you have to deliver
substance.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design is timeless.</b>
In math, every proof is timeless unless it contains a mistake.
So what does Hardy mean when he says there is no permanent 
place for ugly mathematics?  He means the same thing Kelly Johnson did:
if something is ugly, it can&apos;t be the best solution.  There
must be a better one, and eventually
someone will discover it.<br><br>Aiming at timelessness is a way to make
yourself find the best answer:
if you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself.
Some of the greatest masters did this so well that they
left little room for those who came after.
Every engraver since Durer has had to live in his shadow.<br><br>Aiming at timelessness is also a way to evade
the grip of fashion.  Fashions almost by definition
change with time, so if you can make something that
will still look good far into the future, then its
appeal must derive more from merit and less from fashion.<br><br>Strangely enough, if you want to make something that will 
appeal to future generations, one way to do it is to
try to appeal to past generations.  It&apos;s hard to guess what
the future will be like, but we can be sure it will be
like the past in caring nothing for present fashions.
So if you can make something that appeals to people today
and would also have appealed to people in 1500, there is a good
chance it will appeal to people in 2500.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design solves the right problem.</b> The typical
stove has four burners arranged in a square, and a dial
to control each.  How do you arrange the dials?  The
simplest answer is to put them in a row.  But this is a
simple answer to the wrong question.
The dials are for humans to use, and if you put them in a row,
the unlucky human will have to stop and think each time
about which dial matches which burner.  Better to arrange the dials
in a square like the burners.<br><br>A lot of bad design is industrious, but misguided.
In the mid twentieth century there was a vogue for
setting text in sans-serif fonts.
These fonts <i>are</i> closer to the pure, underlying letterforms.
But in text that&apos;s not the problem you&apos;re trying to solve. 
For legibility it&apos;s more important that letters be easy
to tell apart.
It may look Victorian, but a Times Roman lowercase g is
easy to tell from a lowercase y.<br><br>Problems can be improved as well as solutions.
In software, an intractable problem can usually be replaced
by an equivalent one that&apos;s easy to solve.
Physics progressed faster as the problem became
predicting observable behavior, instead of reconciling it
with scripture.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design is suggestive.</b>
Jane Austen&apos;s novels contain almost no
description; instead of telling you how
everything looks, she tells her story so well that you   
envision the scene for yourself.
Likewise, a painting that suggests is usually more engaging
than one that tells.  Everyone makes up their own story about the
Mona Lisa.<br><br>In architecture and design, this
principle means that a building or object should let you 
use it how you want: a good building, for example, will
serve as a backdrop for whatever life people want to lead in it, instead
of making them live as if they were executing a program
written by the architect.<br><br>In software, it means you should give users a few
basic elements that they can combine as they wish, like Lego. 
In math it means a proof that
becomes the basis for a lot of new work is
preferable to a proof that was difficult,
but doesn&apos;t lead to future discoveries; in the
sciences generally, citation is considered a rough
indicator of merit.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design is often slightly funny.</b>  This one
may not always be true.  But Durer&apos;s 
<a href="pilate.html">engravings</a>
and Saarinen&apos;s 
<a href="womb.html">womb chair</a> and the 
<a href="pantheon.html">Pantheon</a> and the
original <a href="1974-911s.html">Porsche 911</a> all seem
to me slightly funny.  Godel&apos;s incompleteness theorem
seems like a practical joke.<br><br>I think it&apos;s because humor is related to strength.
To have a sense of humor is to be strong:
to keep one&apos;s sense of humor is to shrug off misfortunes,
and to lose one&apos;s sense of humor is to be wounded by them.
And so the mark-- or at least the prerogative-- of strength
is not to take
oneself too seriously.
The confident will often, like
swallows, seem to be making fun of the whole process slightly,
as Hitchcock does in his films or Bruegel in his paintings-- or
Shakespeare, for that matter.<br><br>Good design may not have to be funny, but it&apos;s hard to
imagine something that could be called humorless also being
good design.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design is hard.</b>  If you look at the people who&apos;ve
done great work, one thing they all seem to have in common is that they
worked very hard.  If you&apos;re not working hard,
you&apos;re probably wasting your time.<br><br>Hard problems call for great
efforts.  In math, difficult proofs require ingenious solutions,
and those tend to be interesting.  Ditto in engineering.<br><br>When you
have to climb a mountain you toss everything unnecessary
out of your pack.  And so an architect who has to build
on a difficult site, or a small budget, will find that he
is forced to produce an elegant design.  Fashions and
flourishes get knocked aside by the difficult business
of solving the problem at all.<br><br>Not every kind of hard is good.  There is good pain and bad pain.
You want the kind of pain you get from going running, not the
kind you get from stepping on a nail.
A difficult
problem could be good for a designer, but a fickle client or unreliable
materials would not be.<br><br>In art, the highest place has traditionally been given to
paintings of people.  There is something to this tradition,
and not just because pictures of faces get to press
buttons in our brains that other pictures don&apos;t.  We are 
so good at looking at faces that we force anyone who
draws them to work hard to satisfy us.  If you
draw a tree and you change the angle of a branch
five degrees, no one will know.  When you change the angle
of someone&apos;s eye five degrees, people notice.<br><br>When Bauhaus designers adopted Sullivan&apos;s &quot;form follows function,&quot;
what they meant was, form <i>should</i> follow function.  And
if function is hard enough, form is forced to follow it,
because there is no effort to spare for error.  Wild animals
are beautiful because they have hard lives.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design looks easy.</b>  Like great athletes,
great designers make it look easy.  Mostly this is
an illusion.  The easy, conversational tone of good
writing comes only on the eighth rewrite.<br><br>In science and engineering, some of the greatest
discoveries seem so simple that you say to yourself,
I could have thought of that.  The discoverer is
entitled to reply, why didn&apos;t you?<br><br>Some Leonardo heads are just a few lines.  You look
at them and you think, all you have to do is get eight
or ten lines in the right place and you&apos;ve made this beautiful
portrait.  Well, yes, but you have to get them in
<i>exactly</i> the right place.  The slightest error
will make the whole thing collapse.<br><br>Line drawings are in fact the most difficult visual
medium, because they demand near perfection.
In math terms, they are a closed-form solution; lesser  
artists literally solve the same problems by successive
approximation.  One of the reasons kids give up drawing
at ten or so is that they decide to start
drawing like grownups, and one of the first things
they try is a line drawing of a face.  Smack!<br><br>In most fields the appearance of ease seems to come with
practice.  Perhaps what practice does is train your
unconscious mind to handle tasks that used to
require conscious thought.  In some cases
you literally train your body.  An expert pianist can
play notes faster than the brain can send signals to
his hand.  
Likewise an artist, after a while, can
make visual perception flow in through his eye and
out through his hand as automatically as someone tapping his foot to
a beat.<br><br>When people talk about being in
&quot;the zone,&quot; I think what they mean is that the
spinal cord has the situation under control.
Your spinal cord is less hesitant, and
it frees conscious thought for the hard problems.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Good design uses symmetry.</b>
I think symmetry may just
be one way to achieve simplicity, but it&apos;s important enough
to be mentioned on its own.
Nature uses it a lot, which is a good sign.<br><br>There are two kinds of symmetry, repetition and recursion.
Recursion means repetition in subelements, like the
pattern of veins in a leaf.<br><br>Symmetry is unfashionable in some fields now, in reaction to
excesses in the past.  Architects started consciously
making buildings asymmetric in Victorian times and by the
1920s asymmetry was an explicit premise of modernist architecture.
Even these buildings only tended to be asymmetric
about major axes, though; there were hundreds of minor symmetries.<br><br>In writing you find symmetry at every level, from the phrases
in a sentence to the plot of a novel.  You find the same
in music and art.
Mosaics (and some Cezannes) get extra visual punch by making
the whole picture out of the same atoms.  Compositional 
symmetry yields some of the most memorable paintings,  
especially when two halves react to one another, as in 
the <i><a href="symptg.html">Creation of Adam</a></i> or 
<i><a href="symptg.html">American Gothic</a>.</i><br><br>In math and engineering, recursion, especially, is a big win.
Inductive proofs are wonderfully short.  In software,
a problem that can be solved by recursion is nearly always
best solved that way. The Eiffel Tower looks striking partly
because it is a recursive solution, a tower on a tower.<br><br>The danger of symmetry, and repetition especially, is that
it can be used as a substitute for thought.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design resembles nature.</b>  It&apos;s not so much that
resembling nature is intrinsically good as that nature
has had a long time to work on the
problem.  It&apos;s a good sign when your answer resembles nature&apos;s.<br><br>It&apos;s not cheating to copy.
Few would deny that a story should be like life.
Working from life is a valuable tool in painting too, though its
role has often been misunderstood.
The aim is not simply to make a record.
The point of painting from life is
that it gives your mind something to chew on:  when your
eyes are looking at something, your hand will do more
interesting work.<br><br>Imitating nature also works in engineering.  Boats have
long had spines and ribs like an animal&apos;s ribcage.
In some cases we may have to wait for better technology:
early aircraft designers were mistaken to
design aircraft that looked like birds, because they didn&apos;t
have materials or power sources light enough (the Wrights&apos; engine
weighed 152 lbs. and
generated only 12 hp.) or control systems sophisticated
enough for machines that flew like birds, but I could
imagine little unmanned reconnaissance planes flying
like birds in fifty years.<br><br>Now that we have enough computer power, we can imitate nature&apos;s   
method as well as its results.  Genetic algorithms may let us
create things too complex to design in the ordinary
sense.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design is redesign.</b>  It&apos;s rare to get things right
the first time.  Experts expect to throw away some early work.
They plan for plans to change.<br><br>It takes confidence to throw work away.  You have to be able 
to think, <i>there&apos;s more where that came from.</i>   
When people first start drawing, for example,
they&apos;re often reluctant to redo parts that aren&apos;t
right; they feel they&apos;ve been lucky to get that far,   
and if they try to redo something, it will turn out worse.  Instead
they convince themselves that the drawing is not that bad,
really-- in fact, maybe they meant it to look that way.<br><br>Dangerous territory, that; if anything you should
cultivate dissatisfaction.
In Leonardo&apos;s <a href="leonardo.html">drawings</a> there are often five
or six attempts to get a line right.
The distinctive back of the Porsche
911 only appeared in the redesign of an awkward 
<a href="porsche695.html">prototype</a>.
In Wright&apos;s early plans for the 
<a href="guggen.html">Guggenheim</a>,
the right half was a ziggurat; he inverted it to get the
present shape.<br><br>Mistakes are natural.  Instead of treating them
as disasters, make them easy to acknowledge and easy to fix.
Leonardo more or less invented the sketch, as a
way to make drawing bear a greater weight of exploration.
Open-source software has fewer bugs because it admits the
possibility of bugs.<br><br>It helps to have a medium that makes change easy.
When oil paint replaced tempera in the fifteenth century,
it helped
painters to deal with difficult subjects like the human 
figure because, unlike tempera, oil can be blended and overpainted.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Good design can copy.</b>  Attitudes to copying
often make a round trip.  A novice
imitates without knowing it; next he tries
consciously to be original; finally, he decides it&apos;s
more important to be right than original.<br><br>Unknowing imitation is almost a recipe for bad design.
If you don&apos;t know where your ideas are coming from,
you&apos;re probably imitating an imitator.
Raphael so pervaded mid-nineteenth century taste that almost 
anyone who tried to draw was imitating him, often at several
removes.
It was this, more than Raphael&apos;s own work, that bothered
the Pre-Raphaelites.<br><br>The ambitious are not content to imitate. The
second phase in the growth of taste is a conscious
attempt at originality.<br><br>I think the
greatest masters go on to achieve a kind of selflessness.
They just want to get the right answer, and if part of the
right answer has already been discovered by someone else,
that&apos;s no reason not to use it.
They&apos;re confident enough to take from anyone without

<b>Good design is often strange.</b>  Some of the very best work
has an uncanny quality: <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulerFormula.html">Euler&apos;s 
Formula</a>, 
Bruegel&apos;s
<i><a href="hunters.html">Hunters in the Snow</a>,</i> the 
<a href="sr71.html">SR-71</a>, <a href="rootsoflisp.html">Lisp</a>.  They&apos;re not just
beautiful, but strangely beautiful.<br><br>I&apos;m not sure why.  It may just be my own stupidity.  A
can-opener must seem miraculous to a dog.  Maybe if I were smart
enough it would seem the most natural thing in the world that
e<sup>i*pi</sup> = -1.  It is after all necessarily true.<br><br>Most of the qualities I&apos;ve mentioned are things that can be
cultivated, but I don&apos;t think it works to cultivate strangeness.
The best you can do is not squash it if it starts to appear.
Einstein didn&apos;t try to make relativity strange.
He tried to make it true, and the truth turned out to be strange.<br><br>At an art school where I once studied, the students wanted
most of all to develop a personal style.
But if you just try to make good things, you&apos;ll  
inevitably do it in a distinctive way, just as each person
walks in a distinctive way.  Michelangelo was not trying
to paint like Michelangelo.  He was just trying to paint
well; he couldn&apos;t help painting like Michelangelo.<br><br>The only style worth having is the one you can&apos;t help.
And this is especially true for strangeness.  There is no
shortcut to it.  The Northwest Passage that the Mannerists,
the Romantics, and two generations of American high school
students have searched for does not seem to exist.  The
only way to get there is to go through good and come out
the other side.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Good design happens in chunks.</b>  The inhabitants
of fifteenth century Florence included Brunelleschi, Ghiberti,
Donatello, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, 
Fra Angelico, Verrocchio, Botticelli, Leonardo, and Michelangelo.
Milan at the time was as big as Florence.
How many fifteenth century Milanese artists can you name?<br><br>Something was happening in Florence in the fifteenth century.
And it can&apos;t have been heredity, because it isn&apos;t happening now.
You have to assume that whatever
inborn ability Leonardo and Michelangelo had, there were
people born in Milan with just as much.  What happened to
the Milanese Leonardo?<br><br>There are roughly a thousand times
as many people alive in the US right now as lived in
Florence during the fifteenth century.  A thousand Leonardos
and a thousand Michelangelos walk among us.
If DNA ruled, we should be greeted daily by artistic
marvels.  We aren&apos;t, and the reason is that to make Leonardo
you need more than his innate ability.  You also need Florence 
in 1450.<br><br>Nothing is more powerful
than a community of talented people working on related
problems.  Genes count for little by comparison: being a genetic
Leonardo was not enough to compensate for having been born   
near Milan instead of Florence.
Today we move around more, but great work still comes
disproportionately from a few hotspots:
the Bauhaus, the Manhattan Project, the <i>New Yorker,</i>
Lockheed&apos;s Skunk Works, Xerox Parc.<br><br>At any given time there are a
few hot topics and a few groups doing great work on them,
and it&apos;s nearly impossible to do
good work yourself if you&apos;re too far removed from one
of these centers.  You can push or pull these trends
to some extent, but you can&apos;t break away from them.
(Maybe <i>you</i> can, but the Milanese Leonardo couldn&apos;t.)<br><br><br><br>
<b>Good design is often daring.</b>  At every period   
of history, people have believed things that were just   
ridiculous, and believed them so strongly that you risked  
ostracism or even violence by saying otherwise.<br><br>If our own time were any different, that would be remarkable.
As far as I can tell it <a href="say.html">isn&apos;t</a>.<br><br>This problem afflicts not just every
era, but in some degree every field.
Much Renaissance art was in its time considered shockingly secular:
according to Vasari, Botticelli repented and gave up painting, and
Fra Bartolommeo and Lorenzo di Credi actually burned some of their
work.
Einstein&apos;s theory of relativity offended many contemporary physicists,
and was not fully accepted for decades-- in France, not until the
1950s.<br><br>Today&apos;s experimental error is tomorrow&apos;s new theory.  If
you want to discover great new things, then instead of turning
a blind eye to the places where conventional wisdom and
truth don&apos;t quite meet, you should pay particular attention 
to them.<br><br><br><br>As a practical matter, I think it&apos;s easier to see ugliness
than to imagine beauty.  Most of the people who&apos;ve made beautiful
things seem to have done it by fixing something that they    
thought ugly.  Great work usually seems to happen because someone sees
something and thinks, <i>I could do better than that.</i>  Giotto
saw traditional Byzantine madonnas painted according to a
formula that had satisfied everyone for centuries, and to him
they looked wooden and unnatural.
Copernicus was so troubled by a hack that all his contemporaries
could tolerate that he felt there must be a better solution.<br><br>Intolerance for ugliness is not in itself enough.  You have to
understand a field well before you develop a good nose for
what needs fixing.  You have to do your homework.  But as
you become expert in a field, you&apos;ll start to hear little
voices saying, <i>What a hack!  There must be a better way.</i>
Don&apos;t ignore those voices.  Cultivate them.  The recipe for
great work is: very exacting taste, plus the ability
to gratify it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br><a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/sullivan.html">Sullivan</a>

In the discussion about issues raised by <a href="icad.html">Revenge 
of the Nerds</a> on the LL1 mailing list, Paul Prescod wrote
something that stuck in my mind.
<blockquote>
Python&apos;s goal is regularity and readability, not succinctness.
</blockquote>
On the face of it, this seems a rather damning thing to claim about a 
programming language.  As far as I can tell, succinctness = power.
If so, then substituting, we get
<blockquote>
Python&apos;s goal is regularity and readability, not power.
</blockquote>
and this doesn&apos;t seem a tradeoff (if it <i>is</i> a tradeoff)
that you&apos;d want to make. 
It&apos;s not far from saying that Python&apos;s goal is not to be effective 
as a programming language.<br><br>Does succinctness = power?  This seems to me an important question,
maybe the most important question for anyone interested in
language design, and one that it would be useful to confront
directly.  I don&apos;t feel sure yet that the answer is a simple yes, but it seems 
a good hypothesis to begin with.<br><br><b>Hypothesis</b><br><br>My hypothesis is that succinctness is power, or is close enough
that except in pathological examples you can treat them as 
identical.<br><br>It seems to me that succinctness is what programming languages are 
<i>for.</i>  Computers would be just as happy to be told what to
do directly in machine language.  I think that the main
reason we take the trouble to develop high-level languages is to
get leverage, so that we can say (and more importantly, think)
in 10 lines of a high-level language what would require 1000
lines of machine language.  In other words,
the main point of high-level languages is to make source code smaller.<br><br>If smaller source code is the purpose of high-level languages, and
the power of something is how well it achieves its purpose, then
the measure of the power of a programming language is how small it
makes your programs.<br><br>Conversely, a language that doesn&apos;t make your programs small is
doing a bad job of what programming languages are supposed to
do, like a knife that doesn&apos;t cut well, or printing that&apos;s illegible.
<!-- (There are niches for both of these, e.g. plastic knives made for
children, or the way warning messages are printed on cigarette
packages, but I think few languages want to be in such a niche.) --><br><br><b>Metrics</b><br><br>Small in what sense though?  The most common measure of code size is
lines of code.  But I think that this metric is the most common because
it is the easiest to measure.  I don&apos;t think anyone really believes
it is the true test of the length of a program. Different
languages have different conventions for how much you should put
on a line; in C a lot of lines have nothing on them but a delimiter or two.<br><br>Another easy test is the number of characters in a 
program, but this is not very good either; some languages (Perl,
for example) just
use shorter identifiers than others.<br><br>I think a better measure of the size of a program would be the 
number of elements, where an element is anything that
would be a distinct node if you drew a tree representing the 
source code. The name of
a variable or function is an element; 
an integer or a floating-point number is an element;
a segment of literal text is an element;
an element of a pattern, or a format directive, is an element;
a new block is an element.  There are borderline cases
(is -5 two elements or one?) but I think most of them are the
same for every language, so they don&apos;t affect comparisons much.<br><br>This metric needs fleshing out, and
it could require interpretation in the case of specific languages,
but I think it tries to measure the right thing, which is the 
number of parts a program has.  I think the tree you&apos;d draw in this
exercise is what you have to make in your head in order to
conceive of the program, and so its size is proportionate to the
amount of work you have to do to write or read it.<br><br><b>Design</b><br><br>This kind of metric would allow us to compare different languages,
but that is not, at least for me, its main value.  The main value
of the succinctness test is as a guide in <i>designing</i> languages.
The most useful comparison between languages is between two
potential variants of the same language.  What can I do in the
language to make programs shorter?<br><br>If the conceptual load of
a program is proportionate to its complexity, and a given programmer
can tolerate a fixed conceptual load, then this is the same as asking,
what can I do to enable programmers to get the most done?  And
that seems to me identical to asking, how can I design a good
language?<br><br>(Incidentally, nothing makes it more patently obvious that the old
chestnut &quot;all languages are equivalent&quot; is false than designing
languages.  When you are designing a new language, you&apos;re <i>constantly</i>
comparing two languages-- the language if I did x, and if I didn&apos;t-- to
decide which is better.  If this were really a meaningless question,
you might as well flip a coin.)<br><br>Aiming for succinctness seems a good way to find new ideas.
If you can do something that makes many
different programs shorter, it is probably not a coincidence: you have 
probably discovered a useful new abstraction.  You might even be
able to write a program to help by searching
source code for repeated patterns.  Among other languages, those
with a reputation for succinctness would be the ones to look to for
new ideas: Forth, Joy, Icon.<br><br><b>Comparison</b><br><br>The first person to write about these issues, as far as I know, was
Fred Brooks in the <i>Mythical Man Month</i>.  He wrote
that programmers seemed to generate about the same
amount of code per day regardless of the language.
When I first read this in my early twenties,
it was a big surprise to me and seemed to have huge implications.
It meant that (a) the only way to get software written faster was to
use a more succinct language, and (b) someone who took the
trouble to do this could leave competitors who didn&apos;t in the dust.<br><br>Brooks&apos; hypothesis, if it&apos;s true, seems to be at the very heart of hacking.
In the years since, I&apos;ve paid close attention to any evidence I could
get on the question, from formal studies to anecdotes about individual
projects.   I have seen nothing to contradict him.<br><br>I have not yet seen evidence that seemed to me conclusive,
and I don&apos;t expect to.  Studies
like Lutz Prechelt&apos;s comparison of programming languages, while
generating the kind of results I expected, tend to use problems that
are too short to be meaningful tests.  A better test of a language is
what happens in programs that take a month to write.  And the only
real test, if you believe as I do that the main purpose of a language
is to be good to think in (rather than just to tell a computer what to
do once you&apos;ve thought of it) is what new things you can write in it.
So any language comparison where
you have to meet a predefined spec is testing slightly the wrong
thing.<br><br>The true test of a language is how well you can discover
and solve new problems, not
how well you can use it to solve a problem someone else has
already formulated.  These two are quite different criteria.
In art, mediums like embroidery and mosaic work well if you
know beforehand what you want to make, but are absolutely lousy if
you don&apos;t.  When you want to discover the image as you make it--
as you have to do with anything as complex as an image of a
person, for example-- you need to use a more fluid medium like pencil or
ink wash or oil paint.  And indeed, the way tapestries and mosaics are made in
practice is to make a painting first, then copy it.  (The word
&quot;cartoon&quot; was originally used to describe a painting intended for
this purpose).<br><br>What this means is that we are never likely to have accurate comparisons
of the relative power of programming languages.  We&apos;ll have precise
comparisons, but not accurate ones.  In particular, explicit studies
for the purpose of comparing languages,
because they will probably use small problems, and will necessarily use
predefined problems, will tend to underestimate the power of the
more powerful languages.<br><br>Reports from the field, though they will necessarily be less precise than
&quot;scientific&quot; studies, are likely to be more meaningful.  For example, 
Ulf Wiger of Ericsson did a 
<a href="http://www.erlang.se/publications/Ulf_Wiger.pdf">study</a> that 
concluded that Erlang was 4-10x
more succinct than C++, and proportionately faster to develop 
software in:
<blockquote>
Comparisons between Ericsson-internal development projects indicate
similar line/hour productivity, including all phases of software development,
rather independently of which language (Erlang, PLEX, C, C++, or Java)
was used.  What differentiates the different languages then becomes source
code volume.
</blockquote>
 The study also deals explictly with a point that was 
only implicit in Brooks&apos; book (since he measured lines of debugged code):
programs written in more powerful languages tend to have fewer bugs.
That becomes an end in itself, possibly more important than programmer
productivity, in applications like network switches.<br><br><b>The Taste Test</b><br><br>Ultimately, I think you have to go with your gut.  What does it feel
like to program in the language?  I think the way to find (or design)
the best language is to become hypersensitive to how well a language
lets you think, then choose/design the language that feels best.  If
some language feature is awkward or restricting, don&apos;t worry, you&apos;ll
know about it.<br><br>Such hypersensitivity will come at a cost.  You&apos;ll find that you can&apos;t
<i>stand</i> programming in clumsy languages.   I find it unbearably
restrictive to program in languages without macros, just as someone used
to dynamic typing finds it unbearably restrictive to have to go back to
programming in a language where you have to declare the type of
every variable, and can&apos;t make a list of objects of different types.
<!-- (It's like one of those nightmares where you have to go back to 
high school.) --><br><br>I&apos;m not the only one.  I know many Lisp hackers that this has happened
to.  In fact, the most accurate measure of the relative power of programming
languages might be the percentage of people who know the language
who will take any job where they get to use that language, regardless
of the application domain.<br><br><b>Restrictiveness</b><br><br>I think most hackers know what it means for a language to feel restrictive.
What&apos;s happening when you feel that?  I think it&apos;s the same feeling
you get when the street you want to take is blocked off, and you have to
take a long detour to get where you wanted to go.  There is something
you want to say, and the language won&apos;t let you.<br><br>What&apos;s really going on here, I think, is that a restrictive language is
one that isn&apos;t succinct enough.  The problem is not simply that you can&apos;t
say what you planned to.  It&apos;s that the detour the language makes you
take is <i>longer.</i>  Try this thought experiment.  Suppose there were
some program you wanted to write, and the language wouldn&apos;t let you
express it the way you planned to, but instead forced you to write the
program in some other way that was <i>shorter.</i>  For me at least,
that wouldn&apos;t feel very restrictive.  It would be like the street you
wanted to take being blocked off, and the policeman at the 
intersection directing you to a shortcut instead of a detour.  Great!<br><br>I think most (ninety percent?) of 
the feeling of restrictiveness comes from being forced to make the program
you write in the language longer than one you have in your head.
Restrictiveness is mostly lack of succinctness.
So when a language feels restrictive, what that (mostly) means is that it isn&apos;t
succinct enough, and when a language isn&apos;t succinct, it will
feel restrictive.<br><br><b>Readability</b><br><br>The quote I began with mentions two other qualities, regularity and
readability.  I&apos;m not sure what regularity is, or what advantage, 
if any, code that is regular and readable has over code that is merely
readable.  But I think I know what is meant by readability, and I think
it is also related to succinctness.<br><br>We have to be careful here to distinguish between the readability of
an individual line of code and the readability of the whole program.
It&apos;s the second that matters.  I agree that a line of Basic is likely to be
more readable than a line of Lisp.  But a program written in Basic is
is going to have more lines than the same program written in
Lisp (especially once you cross over into Greenspunland). The
total effort of reading the Basic program will surely be greater.
<blockquote>
total effort  = effort per line x number of lines
</blockquote>
I&apos;m not as sure that readability is directly proportionate to succinctness
as I am that power is, but certainly succinctness is a factor 
(in the mathematical sense; see equation above) in readability.
So it may not even be meaningful to say that the goal of a language is
readability, not succinctness; it could be like saying the goal was readability,
not readability.<br><br>What readability-per-line does mean, to the user encountering the language
for the first time, is that source code will <i>look unthreatening</i>.  So
readability-per-line
could be a good marketing decision, even if it is a bad design
decision.  It&apos;s isomorphic to the very successful technique of letting
people pay in installments: instead of frightening them with a high
upfront price, you tell them the low monthly payment.  Installment plans
are a net lose for the buyer, though, as mere readability-per-line probably
is for the programmer.
The buyer is going to make a <i>lot</i> of those low, low payments; and 
the programmer is going to read a <i>lot</i> of those individually readable lines.<br><br>This tradeoff predates programming languages.  If you&apos;re used to reading
novels and newspaper articles, your first experience of reading a math
paper can be dismaying.  It could take half an hour to read a single page.  
And yet, I am pretty sure that the notation is not the problem, even though
it may feel like it is.  The math paper is hard to read 
because the ideas are hard.  If you expressed the same ideas in prose
(as mathematicians had to do before they evolved succinct notations),
they wouldn&apos;t be any easier to read, because the paper would grow to the
size of a book.<br><br><b>To What Extent?</b><br><br>A number of people have rejected
the idea that succinctness = power.  I think it would be more useful, instead
of simply arguing that they are the same or aren&apos;t, to ask:
to what <i>extent</i> does succinctness = power?
Because clearly succinctness is
a large part of what higher-level languages are for.  If it is not all they&apos;re
for, then what else are they for, and how important, relatively, are these
other functions?<br><br>I&apos;m not proposing this just to make the debate more civilized.  I really
want to know the answer.  When, if ever,  is a language too succinct for 
its own good?<br><br>The hypothesis I began with was that, except in pathological examples,
I thought succinctness could be considered identical with power.  What
I meant was that in any language anyone would design, they
would be identical, but that if someone wanted to design a language
explicitly to disprove this hyphothesis, they could probably do it.  I&apos;m
not even sure of that, actually.<br><br><b>Languages, not Programs</b><br><br>We should be clear that we are talking about the succinctness
of languages, not of individual programs.
It certainly is possible for individual programs to be written too densely.<br><br>I wrote about this in <a href="onlisp.html">On Lisp</a>. A complex macro
may have to save many times its own length to be justified.  If writing
some hairy macro could save you ten lines of code every time you use it,
and the macro is itself ten lines of code, then you get a net saving in
lines if you use it more than once.  But that could still be a bad move,
because macro definitions are harder to read than ordinary code.  You 
might have to use the macro ten or twenty times before it yielded a net
improvement in readability.<br><br>I&apos;m sure every language has such tradeoffs (though I suspect the stakes
get higher as the language gets more powerful).  Every programmer must
have seen code that some clever person has made marginally shorter
by using dubious programming tricks.<br><br>So there is no argument about that-- at least, not from me.  Individual
programs can certainly be too succinct for their own good.  The question
is, can a language be?  Can a language compel programmers to write
code that&apos;s short (in elements) at the expense of overall readability?<br><br>One reason it&apos;s hard to imagine a language being too succinct is that if
there were some excessively compact way to phrase something, there would
probably also be a longer way.  For example, if you felt Lisp programs using
a lot of macros or higher-order functions were too dense,  you could, if you
preferred, write code that was isomorphic to Pascal.  If you
don&apos;t want to express factorial in Arc as a call to a higher-order function
<font face="courier"><xmp>
(rec zero 1 * 1-)
</xmp></font>
you can also write out a recursive definition:
<font face="courier"><xmp>
(rfn fact (x) (if (zero x) 1 (* x (fact (1- x)))))
</xmp></font>
Though I can&apos;t off the top of my head think of any examples, I am interested
in the question of whether a language could be too succinct.  Are there languages 
that force you to write code in a way that is crabbed and incomprehensible?
If anyone has examples, I would be very interested to see them.<br><br>(Reminder: What I&apos;m looking for are programs that are very dense according
to the metric of &quot;elements&quot; sketched above, not merely programs that are
short because delimiters can be omitted and everything has a one-character name.)<br><br>

International ICAD User's Group conference in May 2002.
It explains how a language
developed in 1958 manages to be the most powerful  
available even today, what power is and when you need it, and
why pointy-haired bosses (ideally, your
competitors' pointy-haired bosses) deliberately ignore this issue.)<br><br><b>Note:</b> In this talk by "Lisp", I mean the Lisp family of<br><br>languages, including Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp, EuLisp,
Goo, Arc, etc.</i><br><br>
-->
<!-- Let me start by admitting that I don't know much about ICAD.
I do know that it's written in Lisp, and in fact includes Lisp,
in the sense that it lets users create and run Lisp programs.<br><br>It's fairly common for programs written in Lisp to include
Lisp.  Emacs does, and so does Yahoo Store.
But if you think about it, that's kind of strange.
How many programs written in C include C, in the sense that   
the user actually runs the C compiler while he's using the
application?  I can't think of any, unless you count Unix
as an application.  We're only a minute into this talk and
already Lisp is looking kind of unusual.<br><br>Now, it is probably not news to any of you that Lisp is   
looking unusual.  In fact, that was probably the first thing
you noticed about it.<br><br>Believe it or not, there is a reason Lisp code looks
so strange.  Lisp doesn't look this way because it was designed
by a bunch of pointy-headed academics.  It <i>was</i>
designed by pointy-headed academics, but they had hard-headed  
engineering reasons for making the syntax look so strange.<br><br><b>Are All Languages Equivalent?</b>
-->
In the software business there is an ongoing
struggle between the pointy-headed academics, and another
equally formidable force, the pointy-haired bosses.  Everyone
knows who the pointy-haired boss is, right?  I think most
people in the technology world not only recognize this
cartoon character, but know the actual person in their company
that he is modelled upon.<br><br>The pointy-haired boss miraculously combines two qualities
that are common by themselves, but rarely seen together:
(a) he knows nothing whatsoever about technology, and
(b) he has very strong opinions about it.<br><br>Suppose, for example, you need to write a piece of software.
The pointy-haired boss has no idea how this software
has to work, and can&apos;t tell one programming language from
another, and yet he knows what language you should write it in.
Exactly.  He thinks you should write it in Java.<br><br>Why does he think this?  Let&apos;s
take a look inside the brain of the pointy-haired boss.  What
he&apos;s thinking is something like this.  Java is a standard.
I know it must be, because I read about it in the press all the time.
Since it is a standard, I won&apos;t get in trouble for using it.
And that also means there will always be lots of Java programmers,
so if the programmers working for me now quit, as programmers
working for me mysteriously always do, I can easily replace
them.<br><br>Well, this doesn&apos;t sound that unreasonable.  But it&apos;s all
based on one unspoken assumption, and that assumption
turns out to be false.  The pointy-haired boss believes that all
programming languages are pretty much equivalent.
If that were true, he would be right on
target.  If languages are all equivalent, sure, use whatever 
language everyone else is using.<br><br>But all languages are not equivalent, and I think I can prove
this to you without even getting into the differences between them.
If you asked the pointy-haired boss in 1992 what language     
software should be written in, he would have answered with as
little hesitation as he does today.  Software should be  
written in C++.  But if languages are all equivalent, why should the
pointy-haired boss&apos;s opinion ever change?  In fact, why should
the developers of Java have even bothered to create a new
language?<br><br>Presumably, if you create a new language, it&apos;s because you think
it&apos;s better in some way than what people already had.  And in fact, Gosling
makes it clear in the first Java white paper that Java
was designed to fix some problems with C++.
So there you have it: languages are not all equivalent.
If you follow the
trail through the pointy-haired boss&apos;s brain to Java and then
back through Java&apos;s history to its origins, you end up holding
an idea that contradicts the assumption you started with.<br><br>So, who&apos;s right?  James Gosling, or the pointy-haired boss?
Not surprisingly, Gosling is right.  Some languages <i>are</i> better,
for certain problems, than others.  And you know, that raises some
interesting questions.  Java was designed to be better, for certain
problems, than C++.  What problems?  When is Java better and 
when is C++?  Are there situations where other languages are
better than either of them?<br><br>Once you start considering this question, you have opened a
real can of worms.  If the pointy-haired boss had to think
about the problem in its full complexity, it would make his
brain explode.  As long as he considers all languages   
equivalent, all he has to do is choose the one
that seems to have the most momentum, and since that is more
a question of fashion than technology, even he
can probably get the right answer.
But if languages vary, he suddenly
has to solve two simultaneous equations, trying to find
an optimal balance between two things he knows nothing   
about: the relative suitability of the twenty or so leading
languages for the problem he needs to solve, and the odds of
finding programmers, libraries, etc. for each.
If that&apos;s what&apos;s on the other side of the door, it
is no surprise that the pointy-haired boss doesn&apos;t want to open it.<br><br>The disadvantage of believing that all programming languages
are equivalent is that it&apos;s not true.  But the advantage is 
that it makes your life a lot simpler.
And I think that&apos;s the main reason the idea is so widespread.
It is a <i>comfortable</i> idea.<br><br>We know that Java must be pretty good, because it is the
cool, new programming language.  Or is it?  If you look at the world of
programming languages from a distance, it looks like Java is
the latest thing.  (From far enough away, all you can see is
the large, flashing billboard paid for by Sun.)
But if you look at this world
up close, you find that there are degrees of coolness.  Within
the hacker subculture, there is another language called Perl
that is considered a lot cooler than Java.  Slashdot, for
example, is generated by Perl.  I don&apos;t think you would find
those guys using Java Server Pages.  But there is another,
newer language, called Python, whose users tend to look down on Perl,
and <a href="accgen.html">more</a> waiting in the wings.<br><br>If you look at these languages in order, Java, Perl, Python,
you notice an interesting pattern.  At least, you notice this
pattern if you are a Lisp hacker.  Each one is progressively 
more like Lisp.  Python copies even features
that many Lisp hackers consider to be mistakes.
You could translate simple Lisp programs into Python line for line.
It&apos;s 2002, and programming languages have almost caught up 
with 1958.<br><br><b>Catching Up with Math</b><br><br>What I mean is that
Lisp was first discovered by John McCarthy in 1958,
and popular programming languages are only now
catching up with the ideas he developed then.<br><br>Now, how could that be true?  Isn&apos;t computer technology something
that changes very rapidly?  I mean, in 1958, computers were
refrigerator-sized behemoths with the processing power of    
a wristwatch.  How could any technology that old even be
relevant, let alone superior to the latest developments?<br><br>I&apos;ll tell you how.  It&apos;s because Lisp was not really
designed to be a programming language, at least not in the sense
we mean today.  What we mean by a programming language is
something we use to tell a computer what to do.   McCarthy
did eventually intend to develop a programming language in
this sense, but the Lisp that we actually ended up with was based
on something separate that he did as a 
<a href="rootsoflisp.html">theoretical exercise</a>-- an effort
to define a more convenient alternative to the Turing Machine.
As McCarthy said later,
<blockquote>
Another way to show that Lisp was neater than Turing machines
was to write a universal Lisp function
and show that it is briefer and more comprehensible than the
description of a universal Turing machine.
This was the Lisp function <a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/jmc.lisp"><i>eval</i></a>..., 
which computes the value of
a Lisp expression....
Writing <i>eval</i> required inventing a notation representing Lisp
functions as Lisp data, and such a notation
was devised for the purposes of the paper with no thought that
it would be used to express Lisp programs in practice.
</blockquote>
What happened next was that, some time in late 1958, Steve Russell,
one of McCarthy&apos;s
grad students, looked at this definition of <i>eval</i> and realized  
that if he translated it into machine language, the result
would be a Lisp interpreter.<br><br>This was a big surprise at the time.
Here is what McCarthy said about it later in an interview:
<blockquote>
Steve Russell said, look, why don&apos;t I program this <i>eval</i>..., and
I said to him, ho, ho, you&apos;re confusing theory with practice,
this <i>eval</i> is intended for reading, not for
computing. But he went ahead and did it. That is, he compiled the <i>eval</i>
in my paper into [IBM] 704 machine
code, fixing bugs, and then advertised this as a Lisp interpreter,
which it certainly was. So at that point Lisp
had essentially the form that it has today....
</blockquote>
Suddenly, in a matter of weeks I think, McCarthy found his theoretical
exercise transformed into an actual programming language-- and a
more powerful one than he had intended.<br><br>So the short explanation of why this 1950s language is not
obsolete is that it was not technology but math, and
math doesn&apos;t get stale.   The right thing to compare Lisp
to is not 1950s hardware, but, say, the Quicksort
algorithm, which was discovered in 1960 and is still
the fastest general-purpose sort.<br><br>There is one other language still
surviving from the 1950s, Fortran, and it represents the
opposite approach to language design.  Lisp was a
piece of theory that unexpectedly got turned into a
programming language.  Fortran was developed intentionally as
a programming language, but what we would now consider a
very low-level one.<br><br><a href="history.html">Fortran I</a>, the language that was
developed in 1956, was a very different animal from present-day
Fortran.   Fortran I was pretty much assembly
language with math.  In some ways it was less
powerful than more recent assembly languages; there were no   
subroutines, for example, only branches.
Present-day Fortran is now arguably closer to Lisp than to
Fortran I.<br><br>Lisp and Fortran were the trunks of two separate evolutionary trees, 
one rooted in math and one rooted in machine architecture.
These two trees have been converging ever since.
Lisp started out powerful, and over the next twenty years
got fast.  So-called mainstream languages started out
fast, and over the next forty years gradually got more powerful,
until now the most advanced
of them are fairly close to Lisp.
Close, but they are still missing a few things....<br><br><b>What Made Lisp Different</b><br><br>When it was first developed, Lisp embodied nine new
ideas.  Some of these we now take for granted, others are
only seen in more advanced languages, and two are still
unique to Lisp.  The nine ideas are, in order of their
adoption by the mainstream,
<ol>
<li> Conditionals.  A conditional is an if-then-else
construct.  We take these for granted now, but Fortran I
didn&apos;t have them. It had only a conditional goto
closely based on the underlying machine instruction.<br><br></li><li> A function type. In Lisp, functions are
a data type just like integers or strings.
They have a literal representation, can be stored in variables,
can be passed as arguments, and so on.<br><br></li><li> Recursion.  Lisp was the first programming language to
support it.<br><br></li><li> Dynamic typing.  In Lisp, all variables
are effectively pointers. Values are what
have types, not variables, and assigning or binding
variables means copying pointers, not what they point to.<br><br></li><li> Garbage-collection.<br><br></li><li> Programs composed of expressions.  Lisp programs are
trees of expressions, each of which returns a value.
This is in contrast to Fortran
and most succeeding languages, which distinguish between
expressions and statements.<br><br>It was natural to have this
distinction in Fortran I because
you could not nest statements.  And
so while you needed expressions for math to work, there was
no point in making anything else return a value, because
there could not be anything waiting for it.<br><br>This limitation
went away with the arrival of block-structured languages,
but by then it was too late. The distinction between
expressions and statements was entrenched.  It spread from
Fortran into Algol and then to both their descendants.<br><br></li><li> A symbol type.  Symbols are effectively pointers to strings
stored in a hash table.  So
you can test equality by comparing a pointer,
instead of comparing each character.<br><br></li><li> A notation for code using trees of symbols and constants.<br><br></li><li> The whole language there all the time.  There is
no real distinction between read-time, compile-time, and runtime.
You can compile or run code while reading, read or run code
while compiling, and read or compile code at runtime.<br><br>Running code at read-time lets users reprogram Lisp&apos;s syntax;
running code at compile-time is the basis of macros; compiling
at runtime is the basis of Lisp&apos;s use as an extension
language in programs like Emacs; and reading at runtime
enables programs to communicate using s-expressions, an
idea recently reinvented as XML.
</li></ol>
When Lisp first appeared, these ideas were far
removed from ordinary programming practice, which was
dictated largely by the hardware available in the late 1950s.
Over time, the default language, embodied
in a succession of popular languages, has
gradually evolved toward Lisp.  Ideas 1-5 are now widespread.
Number 6 is starting to appear in the mainstream.  
Python has a form of 7, though there doesn&apos;t seem to be    
any syntax for it.<br><br>As for number 8, this may be the most interesting of the
lot.  Ideas 8 and 9 only became part of Lisp
by accident, because Steve Russell implemented
something McCarthy had never intended to be implemented.
And yet these ideas turn out to be responsible for
both Lisp&apos;s strange appearance and its most distinctive
features.  Lisp looks strange not so much because
it has a strange syntax as because it has no syntax;
you express programs directly in the parse trees that
get built behind the scenes when other languages are
parsed, and these trees are made
of lists, which are Lisp data structures.<br><br>Expressing the language in its own data structures turns
out to be a very powerful feature. Ideas 8 and 9
together mean that you
can write programs that write programs.  That may sound
like a bizarre idea, but it&apos;s an everyday thing in Lisp. 
The most common way to do it is with something called a        
<i>macro.</i><br><br>The term &quot;macro&quot; does not mean in Lisp what it means in other
languages.
A Lisp macro can be anything from an abbreviation
to a compiler for a new language.
If you want to really understand Lisp,
or just expand your programming horizons, I would 
<a href="onlisp.html">learn more</a> about macros.<br><br>Macros (in the Lisp sense) are still, as far as
I know, unique to Lisp.
This is partly because in order to have macros you
probably have to make your language look as strange as
Lisp.  It may also be because if you do add that final
increment of power, you can no
longer claim to have invented a new language, but only
a new dialect of Lisp.<br><br>I mention this mostly
as a joke, but it is quite true. If you define
a language that has car, cdr, cons, quote, cond, atom,
eq, and
a notation for functions expressed as lists, then you
can build all the rest of Lisp out of it.  That is in
fact the defining quality of Lisp: it was in order to
make this so that McCarthy gave Lisp the shape it has.<br><br><b>Where Languages Matter</b><br><br>So suppose Lisp does represent a kind of limit     
that mainstream languages are approaching asymptotically-- does
that mean you should actually use it to write software?
How much do you lose by using a less powerful language?
Isn&apos;t it wiser, sometimes, not to be
at the very edge of innovation?
And isn&apos;t popularity to some extent
its own justification?  Isn&apos;t the pointy-haired boss right,
for example, to want to use a language for which he can easily
hire programmers?<br><br>There are, of course, projects where the choice of programming
language doesn&apos;t matter much.  As a
rule, the more demanding the application, the more
leverage you get from using a powerful language.  But
plenty of projects are not demanding at all.
Most programming probably consists of writing 
little glue programs, and for 
little glue programs you
can use any language that you&apos;re already
familiar with and that has good libraries for whatever you
need to do.  If you just need to feed data from one   
Windows app to another, sure, use Visual Basic.<br><br>You can write little glue programs in Lisp too
(I use it as a desktop calculator), but the biggest win
for languages like Lisp is at the other end of
the spectrum, where you need to write sophisticated
programs to solve hard problems in the face of fierce competition.
A good example is the
<a href="carl.html">airline fare search program</a> that ITA Software licenses to
Orbitz.  These
guys entered a market already dominated by two big,
entrenched competitors, Travelocity and Expedia, and  
seem to have just humiliated them technologically.<br><br>The core of ITA&apos;s application is a 200,000 line Common Lisp program
that searches many orders of magnitude more possibilities
than their competitors, who apparently
are still using mainframe-era programming techniques.
(Though ITA is also in a sense
using a mainframe-era programming language.)
I have never seen any of ITA&apos;s code, but according to
one of their top hackers they use a lot of macros,
and I am not surprised to hear it.<br><br><b>Centripetal Forces</b><br><br>I&apos;m not saying there is no cost to using uncommon  
technologies.  The pointy-haired boss is not completely
mistaken to worry about this.  But because he doesn&apos;t understand
the risks, he tends to magnify them.<br><br>I can think of three problems that could arise from using
less common languages.  Your programs might not work well with
programs written in other languages.  You might have fewer
libraries at your disposal.  And you might have trouble
hiring programmers.<br><br>How much of a problem is each of these?  The importance of
the first varies depending on whether you have control
over the whole system.  If you&apos;re writing software that has
to run on a remote user&apos;s machine on top of a buggy,
closed operating system (I mention no names), there may be
advantages to writing your application in the
same language as the OS.
But if you control the whole system and
have the source code of all the parts, as ITA presumably does, you
can use whatever languages you want.  If
any incompatibility arises, you can fix it yourself.<br><br>In server-based applications you can
get away with using the most advanced technologies,
and I think this is the main
cause of what Jonathan Erickson calls the &quot;<a href="http://www.byte.com/documents/s=1821/byt20011214s0003/">programming language
renaissance</a>.&quot;  This is why we even hear about new
languages like Perl and Python.  We&apos;re not hearing about these
languages because people are using them to write Windows
apps, but because people are using them on servers.  And as
software shifts 
<a href="road.html">off the desktop</a> and onto servers (a future even
Microsoft seems resigned to), there will be less
and less pressure to use middle-of-the-road technologies.<br><br>As for libraries, their importance also
depends on the application.  For less demanding problems,
the availability of libraries can outweigh the intrinsic power
of the language.  Where is the breakeven point?  Hard to say
exactly, but wherever it is, it is short of anything you&apos;d
be likely to call an application.  If a company considers
itself to be in the software business, and they&apos;re writing
an application that will be one of their products,
then it will probably involve several hackers and take at
least six months to write.  In a project of that
size, powerful languages probably start to outweigh
the convenience of pre-existing libraries.<br><br>The third worry of the pointy-haired boss, the difficulty
of hiring programmers, I think is a red herring.   How many
hackers do you need to hire, after all?  Surely by now we
all know that software is best developed by teams of less
than ten people.   And you shouldn&apos;t have trouble hiring
hackers on that scale for any language anyone has ever heard
of.  If you can&apos;t find ten Lisp hackers, then your company is
probably based in the wrong city for developing software.<br><br>In fact, choosing a more powerful language probably decreases the
size of the team you need, because (a) if you use a more powerful
language you probably won&apos;t need as many hackers,
and (b) hackers who work in more advanced languages are likely
to be smarter.<br><br>I&apos;m not saying that you won&apos;t get a lot of pressure to use
what are perceived as &quot;standard&quot; technologies.  At Viaweb
(now Yahoo Store),
we raised some eyebrows among VCs and potential acquirers by
using Lisp.  But we also raised eyebrows by using
generic Intel boxes as servers instead of
&quot;industrial strength&quot; servers like Suns, for using a
then-obscure open-source Unix variant called FreeBSD instead
of a real commercial OS like Windows NT, for ignoring
a supposed e-commerce standard called 
<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1017-225723.html">SET</a> that no one now
even remembers, and so on.<br><br>You can&apos;t let the suits make technical decisions for you.
Did it
alarm some potential acquirers that we used Lisp?  Some, slightly,
but if we hadn&apos;t used Lisp, we wouldn&apos;t have been
able to write the software that made them want to buy us.
What seemed like an anomaly to them was in fact
cause and effect.<br><br>If you start a startup, don&apos;t design your product to please
VCs or potential acquirers.  <i>Design your product to please
the users.</i>  If you win the users, everything else will
follow.  And if you don&apos;t, no one will care
how comfortingly orthodox your technology choices were.<br><br><b>The Cost of Being Average</b><br><br>How much do you lose by using a less powerful language?  
There is actually some data out there about that.<br><br>The most convenient measure of power is probably 
<a href="power.html">code size</a>.
The point of high-level
languages is to give you bigger abstractions-- bigger bricks,
as it were, so you don&apos;t need as many to build
a wall of a given size.
So the more powerful
the language, the shorter the program (not simply in
characters, of course, but in distinct elements).<br><br>How does a more powerful language enable you to write
shorter programs?  One technique you can use, if the language will
let you, is something called 
<a href="progbot.html">bottom-up programming</a>.  Instead of
simply writing your application in the base language, you
build on top of the base language a language for writing
programs like yours, then write your program
in it. The combined code can be much shorter than if you
had written your whole program in the base language-- indeed,
this is how most compression algorithms work.
A bottom-up program should be easier to modify as well,  
because in many cases the language layer won&apos;t have to change
at all.<br><br>Code size is important, because the time it takes
to write a program depends mostly on its length.
If your program would be three times as long in another
language, it will take three times as long to write-- and
you can&apos;t get around this by hiring more people, because
beyond a certain size new hires are actually a net lose.
Fred Brooks described this phenomenon in his famous
book <i>The Mythical Man-Month,</i> and everything I&apos;ve seen
has tended to confirm what he said.<br><br>So how much shorter are your programs if you write them in
Lisp?  Most of the numbers I&apos;ve heard for Lisp
versus C, for example, have been around 7-10x.
But a recent article about ITA in 
<a href="http://www.newarchitectmag.com/documents/s=2286/new1015626014044/"><i>New
Architect</i></a> magazine said that
&quot;one line of Lisp can replace 20 lines of C,&quot; and since
this article was full of quotes from ITA&apos;s president, I
assume they got this number from ITA.  If so then
we can put some faith in it; ITA&apos;s software includes a lot
of C and  C++ as well as Lisp, so they are speaking from
experience.<br><br>My guess is that these multiples aren&apos;t even constant.
I think they increase when
you face harder problems and also when you have smarter
programmers.  A really good hacker can squeeze more
out of better tools.<br><br>As one data point on the curve, at any rate,
if you were to compete with ITA and
chose to write your software in C, they would be able to develop
software twenty times faster than you.
If you spent a year on a new feature, they&apos;d be able to
duplicate it in less than three weeks.  Whereas if they spent
just three months developing something new, it would be
<i>five years</i> before you had it too.<br><br>And you know what?  That&apos;s the best-case scenario.
When you talk about code-size ratios, you&apos;re implicitly assuming
that you can actually write the program in the weaker language.
But in fact there are limits on what programmers can do.
If you&apos;re trying to solve a hard problem with a language that&apos;s
too low-level, you reach a point where there is just too 
much to keep in your head at once.<br><br>So when I say it would take ITA&apos;s imaginary
competitor five years to duplicate something ITA could
write in Lisp in three months, I mean five years
if nothing goes wrong.  In fact, the way things work in 
most companies, any
development project that would take five years is
likely never to get finished at all.<br><br>I admit this is an extreme case.  ITA&apos;s hackers seem to
be unusually smart, and C is a pretty low-level language.
But in a competitive market, even a differential of two or
three to one would
be enough to guarantee that you&apos;d always be behind.<br><br><b>A Recipe</b><br><br>This is the kind of possibility that the pointy-haired boss
doesn&apos;t even want to think about.  And so most of them don&apos;t.
Because, you know, when it comes down to it, the pointy-haired
boss doesn&apos;t mind if his company gets their ass kicked, so
long as no one can prove it&apos;s his fault.
The safest plan for him personally
is to stick close to the center of the herd.<br><br>Within large organizations, the phrase used to
describe this approach is &quot;industry best practice.&quot;
Its purpose is to shield the pointy-haired
boss from responsibility: if he chooses
something that is &quot;industry best practice,&quot; and the company
loses, he can&apos;t be blamed.  He didn&apos;t choose, the industry did.<br><br>I believe this term was originally used to describe
accounting methods and so on.  What it means, roughly,
is <i>don&apos;t do anything weird.</i>  And in accounting that&apos;s
probably a good idea.  The terms &quot;cutting-edge&quot; and  
&quot;accounting&quot; do not sound good together.  But when you import
this criterion into decisions about technology, you start
to get the wrong answers.<br><br>Technology often <i>should</i> be
cutting-edge.  In programming languages, as Erann Gat
has pointed out, what &quot;industry best practice&quot;  actually
gets you is not the best, but merely the
average.  When a decision causes you to develop software at
a fraction of the rate of more aggressive competitors,  
&quot;best practice&quot; is a misnomer.<br><br>
So here we have two pieces of information that I think are
very valuable.  In fact, I know it from my own experience.
Number 1, languages vary in power.  Number 2, most managers
deliberately ignore this.  Between them, these two facts
are literally a recipe for making money.  ITA is an example
of this recipe in action.
If you want to win in a software
business, just take on the hardest problem you can find,
use the most powerful language you can get, and wait for
your competitors&apos; pointy-haired bosses to revert to the mean.<br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<b>Appendix: Power</b><br><br>As an illustration of what I mean about the relative power
of programming languages, consider the following problem.
We want to write a function that generates accumulators-- a
function that takes a number n, and
returns a function that takes another number i and
returns n incremented by i.<br><br>(That&apos;s <i>incremented by</i>, not plus.  An accumulator
has to accumulate.)<br><br>In Common Lisp this would be
<font face="courier"><xmp>
(defun foo (n)
  (lambda (i) (incf n i)))
</xmp></font>
and in Perl 5,
<font face="courier"><xmp>
sub foo {  
  my ($n) = @_;
  sub {$n += shift}
}
</xmp></font>
which has more elements than the Lisp version because
you have to extract parameters manually in Perl.<br><br>In Smalltalk the code is slightly longer than in Lisp
<font face="courier"><xmp>
foo: n                              
  |s|                      
  s := n.                          
  ^[:i| s := s+i. ] 
</xmp></font>
because although in general lexical variables work, you can&apos;t
do an assignment to a parameter, so you have to create a
new variable s.<br><br>In Javascript the example is, again, slightly longer, because 
Javascript retains
the distinction between statements and
expressions, so you need explicit <tt>return</tt> statements
to return values:
<font face="courier"><xmp>
function foo(n) { 
  return function (i) { 
           return n += i } }
</xmp></font>
(To be fair, Perl also retains
this distinction, but deals with it in typical Perl fashion
by letting you omit <tt>return</tt>s.)<br><br>If you try to translate the Lisp/Perl/Smalltalk/Javascript code into 
Python you run into some limitations.  Because Python
doesn&apos;t fully support lexical variables,
you have to create a data structure to hold the value of n.
And although
Python does have a function data type, there is no
literal representation for one (unless the body is
only a single expression) so you need to create a named
function to return.  This is what you end up with:
<font face="courier"><xmp>
def foo(n):
  s = [n]
  def bar(i):
    s[0] += i
    return s[0] 
  return bar
</xmp></font>
Python users might legitimately ask why they can&apos;t
just write
<font face="courier"><xmp>
def foo(n):
  return lambda i: return n += i
</xmp></font>
or even
<font face="courier"><xmp>
def foo(n):
  lambda i: n += i
</xmp></font>
and my guess is that they probably will, one day.
(But if they don&apos;t want to wait for Python to evolve the rest
of the way into Lisp, they could always just...)
<!-- (Oscar Wilde: "I wish I had said that." Whistler: "You will,
Oscar, you will.")  --><br><br>In OO languages, you can, to a limited extent, simulate
a closure (a function that refers to variables defined in
enclosing scopes) by defining a class with one method
and a field to replace each variable from an enclosing
scope.  This makes the programmer do the kind of code
analysis that would be done by the compiler in a language
with full support for lexical scope, and it won&apos;t work
if more than one function refers to the same variable,
but it is enough in simple cases like this.<br><br>Python experts seem to agree that this is the
preferred way to solve the problem in Python, writing
either
<font face="courier"><xmp>
def foo(n):
  class acc:
    def __init__(self, s):
        self.s = s
    def inc(self, i):
        self.s += i
        return self.s
  return acc(n).inc
</xmp></font>
or
<font face="courier"><xmp>
class foo:
  def __init__(self, n):
      self.n = n
  def __call__(self, i):
      self.n += i
      return self.n
</xmp></font>
I include these because I wouldn&apos;t want Python
advocates to say I was misrepresenting the language,   
but both seem to me more complex than the first   
version.  You&apos;re doing the same thing, setting up
a separate place to hold the accumulator; it&apos;s just
a field in an object instead of the head of a list.
And the use of these special,
reserved field names, especially <tt>__call__</tt>, seems
a bit of a hack.<br><br>In the rivalry between Perl and Python, the claim of the
Python hackers seems to be that
that Python is a more elegant alternative to Perl, but what
this case shows is that power is the ultimate elegance:
the Perl program is simpler (has fewer elements), even if the
syntax is a bit uglier.<br><br>How about other languages? In the other languages
mentioned in this talk-- Fortran, C, C++, Java, and
Visual Basic-- it is not clear whether you can actually
solve this problem.
Ken Anderson says that the following code is about as close
as you can get in Java:
<font face="courier"><xmp>
public interface Inttoint {
  public int call(int i);
}
</xmp></font>
<font face="courier"><xmp>
public static Inttoint foo(final int n) {
  return new Inttoint() {
    int s = n;
    public int call(int i) {
    s = s + i;
    return s;
    }};
}
</xmp></font>
This falls short of the spec because it only works for
integers.  After many email exchanges with Java hackers,
I would say that writing a properly polymorphic version
that behaves like the preceding examples is somewhere
between damned awkward and impossible.  If anyone wants to
write one I&apos;d be very curious to see it, but I personally
have timed out.<br><br>It&apos;s not literally true that you can&apos;t solve this
problem in other languages, of course.  The fact
that all these languages are Turing-equivalent means
that, strictly speaking, you can write any program in
any of them.  So how would you do it?  In the limit case,
by writing a Lisp
interpreter in the less powerful language.<br><br>That sounds like a joke, but it happens so often to
varying degrees in large programming projects that
there is a name for the phenomenon, Greenspun&apos;s Tenth
Rule:
<blockquote>
 Any sufficiently
     complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc
     informally-specified bug-ridden slow implementation of half of
     Common Lisp.
</blockquote>
If you try to solve a
hard problem, the question is not whether you will use
a powerful enough language, but whether you will (a)
use a powerful language, (b) write a de facto interpreter
for one, or (c) yourself become a human compiler for one.
We see this already
begining to happen in the Python example, where we are
in effect simulating the code that a compiler
would generate to implement a lexical variable.<br><br>This practice is not only common, but institutionalized.  For example,
in the OO world you hear a good deal about 
&quot;patterns&quot;.
I wonder if these patterns are not sometimes evidence of case (c),
the human compiler, at work.  When I see patterns in my programs,
I consider it a sign of trouble.  The shape of a program
should reflect only the problem it needs to solve.
Any other regularity in the code is a sign, to me at
least, that I&apos;m using abstractions that aren&apos;t powerful
enough-- often that I&apos;m generating by hand the
expansions of some macro that I need to write.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br><ul>

August 2002<br><br><i>(This article describes the spam-filtering techniques
used in the spamproof web-based mail reader we
built to exercise <a href="arc.html">Arc</a>. An
improved algorithm is described in <a href="better.html">Better
Bayesian Filtering</a>.)</i><br><br>I think it&apos;s possible to stop spam, and that 
content-based filters are the way to do it.
The Achilles heel of the spammers is their message.
They can circumvent any other barrier you set up.  They have so far, at
least.  But they have to deliver their message, whatever it
is.  If we can write software that recognizes their messages,
there is no way they can get around that.<br><br><center>_ _ _</center><br><br>To the recipient, spam is easily recognizable.  If you hired 
someone to read your mail and discard the spam, they would
have little trouble doing it.  How much do we have
to do, short of AI, to automate this process?<br><br>I think we will be able to solve the problem with fairly
simple algorithms.  In fact, I&apos;ve found that you can filter
present-day spam acceptably well using nothing more than a
Bayesian combination of the spam probabilities of individual
words.  Using a slightly tweaked (as described below) Bayesian
filter, we now miss less than 5 per 1000 spams, with 0 false positives.<br><br>The statistical approach is not usually the first one people
try when they write spam filters.  Most hackers&apos; first instinct is
to try to write software that recognizes individual properties of
spam.  You look at spams
and you think, the gall of these guys to try sending me mail 
that begins &quot;Dear Friend&quot; or has a subject line that&apos;s all
uppercase and ends in eight exclamation points.  I can filter
out that stuff with about one line of code.<br><br>And so you do,
and in the beginning it works.  A few simple rules will take
a big bite out of your incoming spam.  Merely looking
for the word &quot;click&quot; will catch 79.7% of the
emails in my spam corpus, with only 1.2% false positives.<br><br>I spent about six months writing software that looked for
individual spam features before I tried the statistical
approach.  What I found was that recognizing that last few
percent of spams got very hard, and that as I
made the filters stricter I got more false positives.<br><br>False positives are innocent emails that get mistakenly
identified as spams.
For most users,
missing legitimate email is
an order of magnitude worse than receiving spam, so a
filter that yields false positives is like an acne cure
that carries a risk of death to the patient.<br><br>The more spam a user gets, the less
likely he&apos;ll be to notice one innocent mail sitting in his
spam folder.  And strangely enough, the better your spam filters get,
the more dangerous false positives become, because when the
filters are really good, users will be more likely to
ignore everything they catch.<br><br>I don&apos;t know why I avoided trying the statistical approach
for so long.  I think it was because I got addicted to
trying to identify spam features myself, as if I were playing
some kind of competitive game with the spammers.  (Nonhackers
don&apos;t often realize this, but most hackers are very competitive.)
When I did try statistical analysis, I
found immediately that it was much cleverer than I had been.
It discovered, of course, that terms like &quot;virtumundo&quot; and
&quot;teens&quot; were good indicators of spam.  But it also
discovered that &quot;per&quot; and &quot;FL&quot; and &quot;ff0000&quot; are good 
indicators of spam.  In fact, &quot;ff0000&quot; (html for bright red)
turns out to be as good an indicator of spam as any  
pornographic term.<br><br><center>_ _ _</center><br><br>Here&apos;s a sketch of how I do statistical filtering.  I start
with one corpus of spam and one of nonspam mail.  At the
moment each one has about 4000 messages in it.  I scan
the entire text, including headers and embedded html
and javascript, of each message in each corpus.
I currently consider alphanumeric characters,
dashes, apostrophes, and dollar signs to be part of tokens,
and everything else to be a token separator.  (There is
probably room for improvement here.)  I ignore tokens that
are all digits, and I also ignore html comments, not even
considering them as token separators.<br><br>I count the number
of times each token (ignoring case, currently) occurs in
each corpus.  At this stage I end up with two large hash   
tables, one for each corpus, mapping tokens to number
of occurrences.<br><br>Next I create a third hash table, this time mapping
each token to the probability that an email containing it is a spam,
which I calculate as follows [1]:
<font face="courier" size="2"><xmp>
(let ((g (* 2 (or (gethash word good) 0)))
      (b (or (gethash word bad) 0)))
   (unless (< (+ g b) 5)
     (max .01
          (min .99 (float (/ (min 1 (/ b nbad))
                             (+ (min 1 (/ g ngood))   
                                (min 1 (/ b nbad)))))))))
</xmp></font>
where <font face="courier">word</font> is the token whose probability we&apos;re
calculating, <font face="courier">good</font> and <font face="courier">bad</font> are the hash tables
I created in the first step, and <font face="courier">ngood</font> and <font face="courier">nbad</font>
are the number of nonspam and spam messages respectively.<br><br>I explained this as code to show a couple of important details.
I want to bias the probabilities slightly to avoid false
positives, and by trial and error I&apos;ve found that a good
way to do it is to double all the numbers in <font face="courier">good</font>.
This helps to distinguish between words that occasionally
do occur in legitimate email and words that almost never do. 
I only consider words that occur more than five times in
total (actually, because of the doubling, occurring three 
times in nonspam mail would be enough).  And then there is
the question of what probability to assign to words that
occur in one corpus but not the other.  Again by trial and   
error I chose .01 and .99.  There may be room for tuning
here, but as the corpus grows such tuning will happen
automatically anyway.<br><br>The especially observant will notice that while I consider
each corpus to be a single long stream of text for purposes
of counting occurrences, I use the number of emails in
each, rather than their combined length, as the divisor     
in calculating spam probabilities.  This adds another
slight bias to protect against false positives.<br><br>When new mail arrives, it is scanned into tokens, and
the most interesting fifteen tokens, where interesting is  
measured by how far their spam probability is from a
neutral .5, are used to calculate the probability that
the mail is spam.  If <font face="courier">probs</font>
is a list of the fifteen individual probabilities, you
calculate the 
<a href="naivebayes.html">combined</a> probability thus:
<font face="courier" size="2"><xmp>
(let ((prod (apply #'* probs)))
  (/ prod (+ prod (apply #'* (mapcar #'(lambda (x) 
                                         (- 1 x))
                                     probs)))))
</xmp></font>
One question that arises in
practice is what probability to assign to a word you&apos;ve
never seen, i.e. one that doesn&apos;t occur in the hash table
of word probabilities.  I&apos;ve found, again by trial and
error, that .4 is a good number to use.  If you&apos;ve never
seen a word before, it is probably fairly innocent; spam
words tend to be all too familiar.<br><br>There are examples of this algorithm being applied to
actual emails in an appendix at the end.<br><br>I treat mail as spam if the algorithm above gives it a
probability of more than .9 of being spam.  But in practice
it would not matter much where I put this threshold, because
few probabilities end up in the middle of the range.<br><br><center>_ _ _</center><br><br>One great advantage of the statistical approach is that you
don&apos;t have to read so many spams.  Over the past six months,
I&apos;ve read literally thousands of spams, and it is really
kind of demoralizing.  Norbert Wiener said if you compete
with slaves you become a slave, and there is something
similarly degrading about competing with spammers.   To
recognize individual spam features you have to try to get
into the mind of the spammer, and frankly I want to spend
as little time inside the minds of spammers as possible.<br><br>But the real advantage of the Bayesian approach, of course,
is that you know what
you&apos;re measuring.  Feature-recognizing filters like
SpamAssassin assign a spam &quot;score&quot; to email.  The Bayesian
approach assigns an actual probability.  The problem with
a &quot;score&quot; is that no one knows what it means.  The user
doesn&apos;t know what it means, but worse still, neither does
the developer of the filter.  How many <i>points</i> should an
email get for having the word &quot;sex&quot; in it?  A probability
can of course be mistaken, but there is little ambiguity
about what it means, or how evidence should be combined
to calculate it.  Based on my corpus, &quot;sex&quot; indicates
a .97 probability of the containing email being a spam,
whereas &quot;sexy&quot; indicates .99 probability.
And Bayes&apos; Rule, equally unambiguous, says that an email
containing both words would, in the (unlikely)
absence of any other evidence, have a 99.97% chance of
being a spam.<br><br>Because it is measuring probabilities, the Bayesian approach
considers all the evidence in the email, both good and bad.
Words that occur disproportionately <i>rarely</i>
in spam (like &quot;though&quot; or &quot;tonight&quot; or &quot;apparently&quot;)
contribute as much to decreasing the probability as
bad words like &quot;unsubscribe&quot; and &quot;opt-in&quot; do to
increasing it.  So an otherwise innocent email that happens
to include the word &quot;sex&quot; is not going to get tagged as spam.<br><br>Ideally, of course, the probabilities should be calculated
individually for each user.  I get a lot of email containing
the word &quot;Lisp&quot;, and (so far) no spam that does.  So a word
like that is effectively a kind of password for sending
mail to me.  In my earlier spam-filtering software, the user
could set up a list of such words and mail containing
them would automatically get past the filters.  On my
list I put words like &quot;Lisp&quot; and also my zipcode, so
that (otherwise rather spammy-sounding) receipts from
online orders would get through.  I thought I was being
very clever, but I found that the Bayesian filter did the
same thing for me, and moreover discovered of a lot of words I
hadn&apos;t thought of.<br><br>When I said at the start that our filters let through less than
5 spams per 1000 with 0 false positives, I&apos;m talking about
filtering my mail based on a corpus of my mail.  But these
numbers are not misleading, because that is the approach I&apos;m
advocating: filter each user&apos;s mail based on the spam and
nonspam mail he receives.  Essentially, each user should
have two delete buttons, ordinary delete and delete-as-spam.
Anything deleted as spam goes into the spam corpus,   
and everything else goes into the nonspam corpus.<br><br>You could start
users with a seed filter, but ultimately each user should have
his own per-word probabilities based on the actual mail he
receives.  This (a) makes the filters more effective, (b) lets
each user decide their own precise definition of spam,
and (c) perhaps best of all makes it hard for spammers
to tune mails to get through the filters.  If a lot of the  
brain of the filter is in the individual databases, then 
merely tuning spams to get through the seed filters
won&apos;t guarantee anything about how well they&apos;ll get through
individual users&apos; varying and much more trained filters.<br><br>Content-based spam filtering is often combined with a whitelist,
a list of senders whose mail can be accepted with no filtering.
One easy way to build such a
whitelist is to keep a list of every address the user has
ever sent mail to.  If a mail reader has a delete-as-spam
button then you could also add the from address
of every email the user has deleted as ordinary trash.<br><br>I&apos;m an advocate of whitelists, but more as a way to save  
computation than as a way to improve filtering.  I used to think that
whitelists would make filtering easier, because you&apos;d
only have to filter email from people you&apos;d never heard
from, and someone sending you mail for the first time is
constrained by convention in what they can say to you.
Someone you already know might send you an email talking about sex,
but someone sending you mail for the first time would not   
be likely to.  The problem is, people can have more than one 
email address, so a new from-address doesn&apos;t guarantee that
the sender is writing to you for the first time.
It is not unusual
for an old friend (especially if he is a hacker) to suddenly
send you an email with a new from-address, so you can&apos;t
risk false positives by filtering mail from unknown  
addresses especially stringently.<br><br>In a sense, though, my filters do themselves embody a kind
of whitelist (and blacklist) because they are based on
entire messages, including the headers.  So to that
extent they &quot;know&quot; the email addresses of trusted senders
and even the routes by which mail gets from them to me.   
And they know the same about spam, including the server   
names, mailer versions, and protocols.<br><br><center>_ _ _</center><br><br>If I thought that I could keep up current rates of spam
filtering, I would consider this problem solved.  But it
doesn&apos;t mean much to be able to filter out most present-day
spam, because spam evolves.
Indeed, most 
<a href="falsepositives.html">antispam techniques</a> so far have been like pesticides that
do nothing more than create a new, resistant strain of bugs.<br><br>I&apos;m more hopeful about Bayesian filters, because they evolve
with the spam.  So as spammers start using &quot;c0ck&quot;   
instead of &quot;cock&quot; to evade simple-minded spam filters     
based on individual words, Bayesian filters automatically
notice.  Indeed, &quot;c0ck&quot; is far more damning evidence than
&quot;cock&quot;, and Bayesian filters know precisely how much more.<br><br>Still, anyone who proposes a plan for spam filtering has to
be able to answer the question: if the spammers knew
exactly what you were doing,
how well could they get past you?  For example, I think that if
checksum-based spam filtering becomes a serious obstacle,
the spammers will just
switch to mad-lib techniques for generating message bodies.<br><br>To beat Bayesian filters, it would not be enough for spammers
to make their emails unique or to stop using individual
naughty words.  They&apos;d have to make their mails indistinguishable
from your ordinary mail.  And this I think would severely
constrain them.  Spam is mostly sales
pitches, so unless your regular mail is all sales pitches,
spams will inevitably have a different character.  And    
the spammers would also, of course, have to change (and keep 
changing) their whole infrastructure, because otherwise
the headers would look as bad to the Bayesian filters as ever,
no matter what they did to the message body.  I don&apos;t know
enough about the infrastructure that spammers use to know
how hard it would be to make the headers look innocent, but
my guess is that it would be even harder than making the    
message look innocent.<br><br>Assuming they could solve the problem of the headers,
the spam of the future will probably look something like
this:
<font face="courier"><xmp>
Hey there.  Thought you should check out the following:
http://www.27meg.com/foo
</xmp></font>
because that is about as much sales pitch as content-based
filtering will leave the spammer room to make.  (Indeed, it
will be hard even to get this past filters, because if everything
else in the email is neutral, the spam probability will hinge on
the url, and it will take some effort to make that look neutral.)<br><br>Spammers range from businesses running so-called
opt-in lists who don&apos;t even try to conceal their identities,
to guys who hijack mail servers to send out spams promoting
porn sites.  If we use filtering to whittle their
options down to mails like the one above, that should
pretty much put the spammers on the &quot;legitimate&quot; end of
the spectrum out of business; they feel obliged
by various state laws to include boilerplate about why
their spam is not spam, and how to cancel your
&quot;subscription,&quot;  and that kind of text is easy to   
recognize.<br><br>(I used to think it was naive to believe that stricter laws
would decrease spam.  Now I think that while stricter laws  
may not decrease the amount of spam that spammers <i>send,</i>
they can certainly help filters to decrease the amount of  
spam that recipients actually see.)<br><br>All along the spectrum, if you restrict the sales pitches spammers
can make, you will inevitably tend to put them out of
business.  That word <i>business</i> is an important one to
remember.  The spammers are businessmen.  They send spam because
it works.  It works because although the response rate
is abominably low (at best 15 per million, vs 3000 per
million for a catalog mailing), the cost, to them, is  
practically nothing.  The cost is enormous for the recipients,   
about 5 man-weeks for each million recipients who spend  
a second to delete the spam, but the spammer
doesn&apos;t have to pay that.<br><br>Sending spam does cost the spammer something, though. [2]
So the lower we can get the
response rate-- whether by filtering, or by using filters to force
spammers to dilute their pitches-- the fewer businesses will find it
worth their while to send spam.<br><br>The reason the spammers use the kinds of 
<a href="http://www.milliondollaremails.com">sales
pitches</a> that they do is to increase response rates.
This is possibly even more disgusting
than getting inside the mind of a spammer,
but let&apos;s take a quick look inside the mind of someone
who <i>responds</i> to a spam.  This person is either
astonishingly credulous or deeply in denial about their   
sexual interests.  In either case, repulsive or
idiotic as the spam seems to us, it is exciting
to them.  The spammers wouldn&apos;t say these things if they
didn&apos;t sound exciting.  And &quot;thought you
should check out the following&quot; is just not going to
have nearly the pull with the spam recipient as
the kinds of things that spammers say now.
Result: if it can&apos;t contain exciting sales pitches,
spam becomes less effective as a marketing vehicle,
and fewer businesses want to use it.<br><br>That is the big win in the end.  I started writing spam
filtering software because I didn&apos;t want have to look at
the stuff anymore.
But if we get good enough at filtering
out spam, it will stop working, and the spammers
will actually stop sending it.<br><br><center>_ _ _</center><br><br>Of all the approaches to fighting spam, from software to laws,
I believe Bayesian filtering will be the single most
effective.  But I also
think that the more different kinds of antispam efforts
we undertake, the better, because any measure that
constrains spammers will tend to make filtering easier.
And even within the world of content-based filtering, I think
it will be a good thing if there are many different kinds
of software being used simultaneously.  The more different 
filters there are, the harder it will be for
spammers to tune spams to get through them.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Appendix: Examples of Filtering</b><br><br><a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/spam1.txt" target="txtwin">Here</a> is an example of a spam that arrived while I was writing
this article.  The fifteen most interesting words in this spam are:
<font face="courier"><xmp>
qvp0045
indira
mx-05
intimail
$7500
freeyankeedom
cdo
bluefoxmedia
jpg
unsecured
platinum
3d0
qves
7c5
7c266675
</xmp></font>
The words are a mix of stuff from the headers and from the
message body, which is typical of spam.  Also typical of spam
is that every one of these words has a spam probability,
in my database, of .99.  In fact there are more than fifteen words
with probabilities of .99, and these are just the first
fifteen seen.<br><br>Unfortunately that makes this email a boring example of
the use of Bayes&apos; Rule.  To see an interesting variety of
probabilities we have to look at <a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/spam2.txt" target="txtwin">this</a> actually quite
atypical spam.<br><br>The fifteen most interesting words in this spam, with their probabilities,
are:
<font face="courier"><xmp>
madam           0.99
promotion       0.99
republic        0.99

</xmp></font>
This time the evidence is a mix of good and bad.  A word like  
&quot;shortest&quot; is almost as much evidence for innocence as a
word like &quot;madam&quot; or &quot;promotion&quot; is for guilt.  But still the
case for guilt is stronger.  If you combine these numbers
according to Bayes&apos; Rule, the resulting probability is .9027.<br><br>&quot;Madam&quot; is obviously from spams beginning
&quot;Dear Sir or Madam.&quot;  They&apos;re not very common, but the
word &quot;madam&quot; <i>never</i> occurs in my legitimate email, and
it&apos;s all about the ratio.<br><br>&quot;Republic&quot; scores high because
it often shows up in Nigerian scam emails, and also occurs once
or twice in spams referring to Korea and South Africa.
You might say that it&apos;s
an accident that it thus helps identify this spam.  But I&apos;ve
found when examining spam probabilities that there are
a lot of these accidents, and they have an uncanny tendency to
push things in the right direction rather than the wrong one.
In this case, it is not entirely a coincidence that the word
&quot;Republic&quot; occurs in Nigerian scam emails and this spam.
There is a whole class of dubious business propositions involving
less developed countries, and these in turn are more likely
to have names that specify explicitly (because they aren&apos;t) that they
are republics.[3]<br><br>On the other hand, &quot;enter&quot; is a genuine miss.  It occurs
mostly in unsubscribe instructions, but here is used in a
completely innocent way.  Fortunately the statistical approach is
fairly robust, and can tolerate quite a lot of misses
before the results start to be thrown off.<br><br>For comparison, 
<a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/hostexspam.txt" target="txtwin">here</a> is an example of that rare bird, a spam that
gets through the filters.  Why?  Because by sheer chance it happens
to be loaded with words that occur in my actual email:
<font face="courier"><xmp>

There are a couple pieces of good news here.  First, this mail
probably wouldn&apos;t get through the filters of someone who didn&apos;t
happen to specialize in programming languages and have a good
friend called Morris.  For the average user, all the top five words here 
would be neutral and would not contribute to the spam probability.<br><br>Second, I think filtering based on word pairs 
(see below) might well
catch this one:  &quot;cost effective&quot;, &quot;setup fee&quot;, &quot;money back&quot; -- pretty
incriminating stuff.  And of course if they continued to spam me
(or a network I was part of), &quot;Hostex&quot; itself would be
recognized as  a spam term.<br><br>Finally, <a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/legit.txt" target="txtwin">here</a> is an innocent email.

Most of the words here indicate the mail is an innocent one.
There are two bad smelling words,  &quot;color&quot;
(spammers love colored fonts) and &quot;California&quot;
(which occurs in testimonials and also in menus in
forms), but they are not enough to outweigh obviously
innocent words like &quot;continuation&quot; and &quot;example&quot;.<br><br>It&apos;s interesting that &quot;describe&quot; rates as so thoroughly
innocent.  It hasn&apos;t occurred in a
single one of my 4000 spams.  The data turns out to be
full of such surprises.  One of the things you learn
when you analyze spam texts is how
narrow a subset of the language spammers operate in.  It&apos;s
that fact, together with the equally characteristic vocabulary
of any individual user&apos;s mail, that makes Bayesian filtering
a good bet.<br><br><b>Appendix: More Ideas</b><br><br>One idea that I haven&apos;t tried yet is to filter based on
word pairs, or even triples, rather than individual words.
This should yield a much sharper estimate of the probability.
For example, in my current database, the word &quot;offers&quot;
has a probability of .96.  If you based the probabilities  
on word pairs, you&apos;d end up with &quot;special offers&quot;
and &quot;valuable offers&quot; having probabilities of .99
and, say, &quot;approach offers&quot; (as in &quot;this approach offers&quot;)
having a probability of .1 or less.<br><br>The reason I haven&apos;t done this is that filtering based on
individual words already works so well.  But it does
mean that there is room to tighten the filters if spam
gets harder to detect.
(Curiously, a filter based on word pairs would be
in effect a Markov-chaining text generator running
in reverse.)<br><br>Specific spam features (e.g. not seeing the recipient&apos;s
address in the to: field) do of course have value in 
recognizing spam.  They can be considered in this
algorithm by treating them as virtual words.  I&apos;ll probably
do this in future versions, at least for a handful of the
most egregious spam indicators. Feature-recognizing
spam filters are right in many details; what they lack
is an overall discipline for combining evidence.<br><br>Recognizing nonspam features may be more important than
recognizing spam features.  False positives are such a
worry that they demand extraordinary measures.  I will
probably in future versions add a second level of testing
designed specifically to avoid false positives.  If a
mail triggers this second level of filters it will be accepted
even if its spam probability is above the threshold.<br><br>I don&apos;t expect this second level of filtering to be Bayesian.
It will inevitably 
be not only ad hoc, but based on guesses, because the number of
false positives will not tend to be large enough to notice patterns.
(It is just as well, anyway, if a backup system doesn&apos;t rely on the same
technology as the primary system.)<br><br>Another thing I may try in the future is to focus extra attention
on specific parts of the email.  For example, about 95% of current
spam includes the url of a site they want
you to visit.  (The remaining 5% want you to call a phone number,
reply by email or to a US mail address, or in a few
cases to buy a certain stock.)   The url is in such cases
practically enough by itself to determine whether the email
is spam.<br><br>Domain names differ from the rest of the text in
a (non-German) email in that they often consist of several
words stuck together.  Though computationally expensive 
in the general case, it might be worth trying to 
decompose them.  If a filter has never seen the
token &quot;xxxporn&quot; before it will have an individual spam
probability of .4, whereas &quot;xxx&quot; and &quot;porn&quot; individually
have probabilities (in my corpus) of .9889 and .99
respectively, and a combined probability of .9998.<br><br>I expect decomposing domain names to become more
important as spammers are gradually forced to stop using
incriminating words in the text of their messages.  (A url
with an ip address is of course an extremely incriminating sign,
except in the mail of a few sysadmins.)<br><br>It might be a good idea to have a cooperatively maintained
list of urls promoted by spammers.  We&apos;d need a trust metric
of the type studied by Raph Levien to prevent malicious
or incompetent submissions, but if we had such a thing it
would provide a boost to any filtering software.   It would
also be a convenient basis for boycotts.<br><br>Another way to test dubious urls would be to send out a
crawler to look at the site before the user looked at the
email mentioning it.  You could use a Bayesian filter to
rate the site just as you would an email, and whatever
was found on the site could be included in calculating
the probability of the email being a spam.  A url that led
to a redirect would of course be especially suspicious.<br><br>One cooperative project that I think really would be a good
idea would be to accumulate a giant corpus of spam.  A large,
clean corpus is the key to making Bayesian filtering work
well.  Bayesian filters could actually use the corpus as
input.  But such a corpus would be useful for other kinds
of filters too, because it could be used to test them.<br><br>Creating such a corpus poses some technical problems.  We&apos;d
need trust metrics to prevent malicious or incompetent
submissions, of course.  We&apos;d also need ways of erasing   
personal information (not just to-addresses and ccs, but
also e.g. the arguments to unsubscribe urls, which often
encode the to-address) from mails in the corpus.  If anyone
wants to take on this project, it would be a good thing for
the world.<br><br><b>Appendix: Defining Spam</b><br><br>I think there is a rough
consensus on what spam is, but it would be useful to have
an explicit definition.  We&apos;ll need to do this if we want to establish
a central corpus of spam, or even to compare spam filtering
rates meaningfully.<br><br>To start with, spam is not unsolicited commercial email.
If someone in my neighborhood heard that I was looking for an old
Raleigh three-speed in good condition, and sent me an email
offering to sell me one, I&apos;d be delighted, and yet this
email would be both commercial and unsolicited.  The
defining feature of spam (in fact, its <i>raison d&apos;etre</i>)
is not that it is unsolicited, but that it is automated.<br><br>It is merely incidental, too, that spam is usually commercial.
If someone started sending mass email to support some political
cause, for example, it would be just as much spam as email
promoting a porn site.<br><br>I propose we define spam as <b>unsolicited automated email</b>.
This definition thus includes some email
that many legal definitions of spam don&apos;t.  Legal definitions
of spam, influenced presumably by lobbyists, tend to exclude
mail sent by companies that have an &quot;existing relationship&quot; with
the recipient.  But buying something from a company, for
example, does not imply that you have solicited
ongoing email from them.
If I order something from an online
store, and they then send me a stream of spam, it&apos;s still
spam.<br><br>Companies sending spam often give you a way to &quot;unsubscribe,&quot;
or ask you to go to their site and change your &quot;account
preferences&quot; if you want to stop getting spam.  This is
not enough to stop the mail from being spam.  Not opting out
is not the same as opting in.  Unless the   
recipient explicitly checked a clearly labelled box (whose
default was no) asking to receive the email, then it is spam.<br><br>In some business relationships, you do implicitly solicit
certain kinds of mail.   When you order online, I think you
implicitly solicit a receipt, and notification when the
order ships.
I don&apos;t mind when Verisign sends me mail warning that
a domain name is about to expire (at least, if they are the
<a href="http://siliconvalley.internet.com/news/article.php/1441651">actual 
registrar</a> for it).  But when Verisign sends me
email offering a FREE Guide to Building My
E-Commerce Web Site, that&apos;s spam.<br><br>
<b>Notes:</b><br><br>[1] The examples in this article are translated
into Common Lisp for, believe it or not, greater accessibility.
The application described here is one that we wrote in order to
test a new Lisp dialect called <a href="arc.html">Arc</a> that is 
not yet released.<br><br>[2] Currently the lowest rate seems to be about $200 to send a million spams.
That&apos;s very cheap, 1/50th of a cent per spam.
But filtering out 95%
of spam, for example, would increase the spammers&apos; cost to reach
a given audience by a factor of 20.  Few can have
margins big enough to absorb that.<br><br>[3] As a rule of thumb, the more qualifiers there are before the
name of a country, the more corrupt the rulers.  A
country called The Socialist People&apos;s Democratic Republic
of X is probably the last place in the world you&apos;d want to live.<br><br>

id="desres">Design and Research</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">January 2003<br><br><i>(This article is derived from a keynote talk at the fall 2002 meeting
of NEPLS.)</i><br><br>Visitors to this country are often surprised to find that
Americans like to begin a conversation by asking &quot;what do you do?&quot;
I&apos;ve never liked this question.  I&apos;ve rarely had a
neat answer to it.  But I think I have finally solved the problem.
Now, when someone asks me what I do, I look them straight
in the eye and say &quot;I&apos;m designing a 
<a href="arc.html">new dialect of Lisp</a>.&quot;   
I recommend this answer to anyone who doesn&apos;t like being asked what
they do.  The conversation will turn immediately to other topics.<br><br>I don&apos;t consider myself to be doing research on programming languages.
I&apos;m just designing one, in the same way that someone might design
a building or a chair or a new typeface.
I&apos;m not trying to discover anything new.  I just want
to make a language that will be good to program in.  In some ways,
this assumption makes life a lot easier.<br><br>The difference between design and research seems to be a question
of new versus good.  Design doesn&apos;t have to be new, but it has to  
be good.  Research doesn&apos;t have to be good, but it has to be new.
I think these two paths converge at the top: the best design
surpasses its predecessors by using new ideas, and the best research
solves problems that are not only new, but actually worth solving.
So ultimately we&apos;re aiming for the same destination, just approaching
it from different directions.<br><br>What I&apos;m going to talk about today is what your target looks like
from the back.  What do you do differently when you treat
programming languages as a design problem instead of a research topic?<br><br><br><br>The biggest difference is that you focus more on the user.
Design begins by asking, who is this
for and what do they need from it?  A good architect,
for example, does not begin by creating a design that he then
imposes on the users, but by studying the intended users and figuring
out what they need.<br><br>Notice I said &quot;what they need,&quot; not &quot;what they want.&quot;  I don&apos;t mean
to give the impression that working as a designer means working as 
a sort of short-order cook, making whatever the client tells you
to.  This varies from field to field in the arts, but
I don&apos;t think there is any field in which the best work is done by
the people who just make exactly what the customers tell them to.<br><br>The customer <i>is</i> always right in
the sense that the measure of good design is how well it works
for the user.  If you make a novel that bores everyone, or a chair
that&apos;s horribly uncomfortable to sit in, then you&apos;ve done a bad
job, period.  It&apos;s no defense to say that the novel or the chair  
is designed according to the most advanced theoretical principles.<br><br>And yet, making what works for the user doesn&apos;t mean simply making
what the user tells you to.  Users don&apos;t know what all the choices
are, and are often mistaken about what they really want.<br><br>The answer to the paradox, I think, is that you have to design
for the user, but you have to design what the user needs, not simply  
what he says he wants.
It&apos;s much like being a doctor.  You can&apos;t just treat a patient&apos;s
symptoms.  When a patient tells you his symptoms, you have to figure
out what&apos;s actually wrong with him, and treat that.<br><br>This focus on the user is a kind of axiom from which most of the
practice of good design can be derived, and around which most design
issues center.<br><br><br><br>If good design must do what the user needs, who is the user?  When
I say that design must be for users, I don&apos;t mean to imply that good 
design aims at some kind of  
lowest common denominator.  You can pick any group of users you
want.  If you&apos;re designing a tool, for example, you can design it
for anyone from beginners to experts, and what&apos;s good design
for one group might be bad for another.  The point
is, you have to pick some group of users.  I don&apos;t think you can
even talk about good or bad design except with
reference to some intended user.<br><br>You&apos;re most likely to get good design if the intended users include
the designer himself.  When you design something
for a group that doesn&apos;t include you, it tends to be for people
you consider to be less sophisticated than you, not more sophisticated.<br><br>That&apos;s a problem, because looking down on the user, however benevolently,
seems inevitably to corrupt the designer.
I suspect that very few housing
projects in the US were designed by architects who expected to live
in them.   You can see the same thing
in programming languages.  C, Lisp, and Smalltalk were created for
their own designers to use.  Cobol, Ada, and Java, were created   
for other people to use.<br><br>If you think you&apos;re designing something for idiots, the odds are
that you&apos;re not designing something good, even for idiots.<br><br><br><br>
Even if you&apos;re designing something for the most sophisticated
users, though, you&apos;re still designing for humans.  It&apos;s different 
in research.  In math you
don&apos;t choose abstractions because they&apos;re
easy for humans to understand; you choose whichever make the
proof shorter.  I think this is true for the sciences generally.
Scientific ideas are not meant to be ergonomic.<br><br>Over in the arts, things are very different.  Design is
all about people.  The human body is a strange
thing, but when you&apos;re designing a chair,
that&apos;s what you&apos;re designing for, and there&apos;s no way around it.
All the arts have to pander to the interests and limitations
of humans.   In painting, for example, all other things being
equal a painting with people in it will be more interesting than
one without.  It is not merely an accident of history that
the great paintings of the Renaissance are all full of people.
If they hadn&apos;t been, painting as a medium wouldn&apos;t have the prestige
that it does.<br><br>Like it or not, programming languages are also for people,
and I suspect the human brain is just as lumpy and idiosyncratic
as the human body.  Some ideas are easy for people to grasp
and some aren&apos;t.  For example, we seem to have a very limited
capacity for dealing with detail.  It&apos;s this fact that makes
programing languages a good idea in the first place; if we
could handle the detail, we could just program in machine
language.<br><br>Remember, too, that languages are not
primarily a form for finished programs, but something that
programs have to be developed in.  Anyone in the arts could
tell you that you might want different mediums for the
two situations.  Marble, for example, is a nice, durable
medium for finished ideas, but a hopelessly inflexible one
for developing new ideas.<br><br>A program, like a proof,
is a pruned version of a tree that in the past has had
false starts branching off all over it.  So the test of
a language is not simply how clean the finished program looks
in it, but how clean the path to the finished program was.
A design choice that gives you elegant finished programs
may not give you an elegant design process.  For example, 
I&apos;ve written a few macro-defining macros full of nested
backquotes that look now like little gems, but writing them
took hours of the ugliest trial and error, and frankly, I&apos;m still
not entirely sure they&apos;re correct.<br><br>We often act as if the test of a language were how good
finished programs look in it.
It seems so convincing when you see the same program
written in two languages, and one version is much shorter.
When you approach the problem from the direction of the
arts, you&apos;re less likely to depend on this sort of
test.  You don&apos;t want to end up with a programming
language like marble.<br><br>For example, it is a huge win in developing software to
have an interactive toplevel, what in Lisp is called a
read-eval-print loop.  And when you have one this has
real effects on the design of the language.  It would not
work well for a language where you have to declare
variables before using them, for example.  When you&apos;re
just typing expressions into the toplevel, you want to be 
able to set x to some value and then start doing things
to x.  You don&apos;t want to have to declare the type of x
first.  You may dispute either of the premises, but if
a language has to have a toplevel to be convenient, and
mandatory type declarations are incompatible with a
toplevel, then no language that makes type declarations  
mandatory could be convenient to program in.<br><br><br><br>In practice, to get good design you have to get close, and stay
close, to your users.  You have to calibrate your ideas on actual
users constantly, especially in the beginning.  One of the reasons
Jane Austen&apos;s novels are so good is that she read them out loud to
her family.  That&apos;s why she never sinks into self-indulgently arty
descriptions of landscapes,
or pretentious philosophizing.  (The philosophy&apos;s there, but it&apos;s
woven into the story instead of being pasted onto it like a label.)
If you open an average &quot;literary&quot; novel and imagine reading it out loud
to your friends as something you&apos;d written, you&apos;ll feel all too
keenly what an imposition that kind of thing is upon the reader.<br><br>In the software world, this idea is known as Worse is Better.
Actually, there are several ideas mixed together in the concept of
Worse is Better, which is why people are still arguing about
whether worse
is actually better or not.  But one of the main ideas in that
mix is that if you&apos;re building something new, you should get a
prototype in front of users as soon as possible.<br><br>The alternative approach might be called the Hail Mary strategy.
Instead of getting a prototype out quickly and gradually refining
it, you try to create the complete, finished, product in one long
touchdown pass.  As far as I know, this is a
recipe for disaster.  Countless startups destroyed themselves this
way during the Internet bubble.  I&apos;ve never heard of a case
where it worked.<br><br>What people outside the software world may not realize is that
Worse is Better is found throughout the arts.
In drawing, for example, the idea was discovered during the
Renaissance.  Now almost every drawing teacher will tell you that
the right way to get an accurate drawing is not to
work your way slowly around the contour of an object, because errors will
accumulate and you&apos;ll find at the end that the lines don&apos;t meet.
Instead you should draw a few quick lines in roughly the right place,
and then gradually refine this initial sketch.<br><br>In most fields, prototypes
have traditionally been made out of different materials.
Typefaces to be cut in metal were initially designed  
with a brush on paper.  Statues to be cast in bronze   
were modelled in wax.  Patterns to be embroidered on tapestries
were drawn on paper with ink wash.  Buildings to be
constructed from stone were tested on a smaller scale in wood.<br><br>What made oil paint so exciting, when it
first became popular in the fifteenth century, was that you
could actually make the finished work <i>from</i> the prototype.
You could make a preliminary drawing if you wanted to, but you
weren&apos;t held to it; you could work out all the details, and
even make major changes, as you finished the painting.<br><br>You can do this in software too.  A prototype doesn&apos;t have to
be just a model; you can refine it into the finished product.
I think you should always do this when you can.  It lets you
take advantage of new insights you have along the way.  But
perhaps even more important, it&apos;s good for morale.<br><br><br><br>Morale is key in design.  I&apos;m surprised people
don&apos;t talk more about it.  One of my first
drawing teachers told me: if you&apos;re bored when you&apos;re
drawing something, the drawing will look boring.
For example, suppose you have to draw a building, and you
decide to draw each brick individually.  You can do this
if you want, but if you get bored halfway through and start
making the bricks mechanically instead of observing each one,   
the drawing will look worse than if you had merely suggested
the bricks.<br><br>Building something by gradually refining a prototype is good
for morale because it keeps you engaged.  In software, my  
rule is: always have working code.  If you&apos;re writing
something that you&apos;ll be able to test in an hour, then you
have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you.
The same is true in the arts, and particularly in oil painting.
Most painters start with a blurry sketch and gradually
refine it.
If you work this way, then in principle
you never have to end the day with something that actually
looks unfinished.  Indeed, there is even a saying among
painters: &quot;A painting is never finished, you just stop
working on it.&quot;  This idea will be familiar to anyone who
has worked on software.<br><br>Morale is another reason that it&apos;s hard to design something
for an unsophisticated user.   It&apos;s hard to stay interested in
something you don&apos;t like yourself.  To make something  
good, you have to be thinking, &quot;wow, this is really great,&quot;
not &quot;what a piece of shit; those fools will love it.&quot;<br><br>Design means making things for humans.  But it&apos;s not just the
user who&apos;s human.  The designer is human too.<br><br><br><br>Notice all this time I&apos;ve been talking about &quot;the designer.&quot;
Design usually has to be under the control of a single person to
be any good.   And yet it seems to be possible for several people
to collaborate on a research project.  This seems to
me one of the most interesting differences between research and
design.<br><br>There have been famous instances of collaboration in the arts,
but most of them seem to have been cases of molecular bonding rather
than nuclear fusion.  In an opera it&apos;s common for one person to
write the libretto and another to write the music.   And during the Renaissance, 
journeymen from northern
Europe were often employed to do the landscapes in the
backgrounds of Italian paintings.  But these aren&apos;t true collaborations.
They&apos;re more like examples of Robert Frost&apos;s
&quot;good fences make good neighbors.&quot;  You can stick instances
of good design together, but within each individual project,
one person has to be in control.<br><br>I&apos;m not saying that good design requires that one person think
of everything.  There&apos;s nothing more valuable than the advice
of someone whose judgement you trust.  But after the talking is
done, the decision about what to do has to rest with one person.<br><br>Why is it that research can be done by collaborators and  
design can&apos;t?  This is an interesting question.  I don&apos;t 
know the answer.  Perhaps,
if design and research converge, the best research is also
good design, and in fact can&apos;t be done by collaborators.
A lot of the most famous scientists seem to have worked alone.
But I don&apos;t know enough to say whether there
is a pattern here.  It could be simply that many famous scientists
worked when collaboration was less common.<br><br>Whatever the story is in the sciences, true collaboration
seems to be vanishingly rare in the arts.  Design by committee is a
synonym for bad design.  Why is that so?  Is there some way to
beat this limitation?<br><br>I&apos;m inclined to think there isn&apos;t-- that good design requires
a dictator.  One reason is that good design has to   
be all of a piece.  Design is not just for humans, but
for individual humans.  If a design represents an idea that  
fits in one person&apos;s head, then the idea will fit in the user&apos;s
head too.<br><br><br><br><b>Related:</b><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="421"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.shiro.dreamhost.com/scheme/trans/desres-j.html">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="421"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html">Taste for Makers</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="421"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://ro.goobix.com/pg/desres/">Romanian Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="421"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.cibercalli.com/erick/hackingnews/diseo-e-investigacion">Spanish Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="better">Better Bayesian Filtering</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">January 2003<br><br><i>(This article was given as a talk at the 2003 Spam Conference.
It describes the work I&apos;ve done to improve the performance of
the algorithm described in <a href="spam.html">A Plan for Spam</a>,
and what I plan to do in the future.)</i><br><br>The first discovery I&apos;d like to present here is an algorithm for
lazy evaluation of research papers.  Just
write whatever you want and don&apos;t cite any previous work, and
indignant readers will send you references to all the papers you
should have cited.   I discovered this algorithm
after ``A Plan for Spam&apos;&apos; [1] was on Slashdot.<br><br>Spam filtering is a subset of text classification,
which is a well established field, but the first papers about
Bayesian
spam filtering per se seem to have been two
given at the same conference in 1998,
one by Pantel and Lin [2],
and another by a group from
Microsoft Research [3].<br><br>When I heard about this work I was a bit surprised.  If
people had been onto Bayesian filtering four years ago,
why wasn&apos;t everyone using it?
When I read the papers I found out why.  Pantel and Lin&apos;s filter was the
more effective of the two, but it
only caught 92% of spam, with 1.16% false positives.<br><br>When I tried writing a Bayesian spam filter,
it caught 99.5% of spam with less than .03% false
positives [4].
It&apos;s always alarming when two people
trying the same experiment get widely divergent results.
It&apos;s especially alarming here because those two sets of numbers
might yield opposite conclusions.
Different users have different requirements, but I think for
many people a filtering rate of 92% with 1.16% false positives means
that filtering is not an acceptable solution, whereas
99.5% with less than .03% false positives means that it is.<br><br>So why did we get such different numbers?
I haven&apos;t tried to reproduce Pantel and Lin&apos;s results, but
from reading the paper I see five things that probably account
for the difference.<br><br>One is simply that they trained their filter on very little
data: 160 spam and 466 nonspam mails.
Filter performance should still be climbing with data
sets that small.  So their numbers may not even be an accurate
measure of the performance of their algorithm, let alone of
Bayesian spam filtering in general.<br><br>But I think the most important difference is probably
that they ignored message headers.  To anyone who has worked
on spam filters, this will seem a perverse decision.
And yet in the very first filters I tried writing, I ignored the
headers too.  Why?  Because I wanted to keep the problem neat.
I didn&apos;t know much about mail headers then, and they seemed to me
full of random stuff.  There is a lesson here for filter
writers: don&apos;t ignore data.  You&apos;d think this lesson would
be too obvious to mention, but I&apos;ve had to learn it several times.<br><br>Third, Pantel and Lin stemmed the tokens, meaning they reduced e.g. both
``mailing&apos;&apos; and ``mailed&apos;&apos; to the root ``mail&apos;&apos;.   They may
have felt they were forced to do this by the small size
of their corpus, but if so this is a kind of premature 
optimization.<br><br>Fourth, they calculated probabilities differently.
They used all the tokens, whereas I only
use the 15 most significant.  If you use all the tokens
you&apos;ll tend to miss longer spams, the type where someone tells you their life
story up to the point where they got rich from some multilevel
marketing scheme.  And such an algorithm
would be easy for spammers to spoof: just add a big
chunk of random text to counterbalance the spam terms.<br><br>Finally, they didn&apos;t bias against false positives.
I think
any spam filtering algorithm ought to have a convenient
knob you can twist to decrease the
false positive rate at the expense of the filtering rate.
I do this by counting the occurrences
of tokens in the nonspam corpus double.  
<!--ref to Woodhead's graphs--><br><br>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a good idea to treat spam filtering as
a straight text classification problem.  You can use
text classification techniques, but solutions can and should
reflect the fact that the text is email, and spam
in particular.  Email is not just text; it has structure.
Spam filtering is not just classification, because
false positives are so much worse than false negatives
that you should treat them as a different kind of error.
And the source of error is not just random variation, but
a live human spammer working actively to defeat your filter.<br><br><b>Tokens</b><br><br>Another project I heard about
after the Slashdot article was Bill Yerazunis&apos; 
<a href="http://crm114.sourceforge.net">CRM114</a> [5].
This is the counterexample to the design principle I
just mentioned.  It&apos;s a straight text classifier,
but such a stunningly effective one that it manages to filter
spam almost perfectly without even knowing that&apos;s
what it&apos;s doing.<br><br>Once I understood how CRM114 worked, it seemed
inevitable that I would eventually have to move from filtering based
on single words to an approach like this.  But first, I thought,
I&apos;ll see how far I can get with single words.  And the answer is,
surprisingly far.<br><br>Mostly I&apos;ve been working on smarter tokenization.  On
current spam, I&apos;ve been able to achieve filtering rates that
approach CRM114&apos;s.  These techniques are mostly orthogonal to Bill&apos;s;
an optimal solution might incorporate both.<br><br>``A Plan for Spam&apos;&apos; uses a very simple
definition of a token.  Letters, digits, dashes, apostrophes,
and dollar signs are constituent characters, and everything
else is a token separator.  I also ignored case.<br><br>Now I have a more complicated definition of a token:
<ol>
<li> Case is preserved.<br><br></li><li> Exclamation points are constituent characters.<br><br></li><li> Periods and commas are constituents if they occur
 between two digits.  This lets me get ip addresses
 and prices intact.<br><br></li><li> A price range like $20-25 yields two tokens,
 $20 and $25.<br><br></li><li> Tokens that occur within the
 To, From, Subject, and Return-Path lines, or within urls,
 get marked accordingly.  E.g. ``foo&apos;&apos; in the Subject line
 becomes ``Subject*foo&apos;&apos;.  (The asterisk could
 be any character you don&apos;t allow as a constituent.)
</li></ol>
Such measures increase the filter&apos;s vocabulary, which
makes it more discriminating.  For example, in the current
filter, ``free&apos;&apos; in the Subject line
has a spam probability of 98%, whereas the same token
in the body has a spam probability of only 65%.<br><br>Here are some of the current probabilities [6]:<br><br><font face="courier"><pre>
Subject*FREE      0.9999
free!!            0.9999
To*free           0.9998
Subject*free      0.9782
free!             0.9199
Free              0.9198
Url*free          0.9091
FREE              0.8747
From*free         0.7636
free              0.6546
</pre></font>
In the Plan for Spam filter, all these tokens would have had the
same probability, .7602.  That filter recognized about 23,000
tokens.  The current one recognizes about 187,000.<br><br>The disadvantage of having a larger universe of tokens
is that there is more
chance of misses.
Spreading your corpus out over more tokens
has the same effect as making it smaller.
If you consider exclamation points as
constituents, for example, then you could end up
not having a spam probability for free with seven exclamation
points, even though you know that free with just two   
exclamation points has a probability of 99.99%.<br><br>One solution to this is what I call degeneration.  If you
can&apos;t find an exact match for a token,
treat it as if it were a less specific
version.  I consider terminal exclamation
points, uppercase letters, and occurring in one of the
five marked contexts as making a token more specific.
For example, if I don&apos;t find a probability for
``Subject*free!&apos;&apos;, I look for probabilities for
``Subject*free&apos;&apos;, ``free!&apos;&apos;, and ``free&apos;&apos;, and take whichever one
is farthest from .5.<br><br>Here are the alternatives [7]
considered if the filter sees ``FREE!!!&apos;&apos; in the
Subject line and doesn&apos;t have a probability for it.<br><br><font face="courier"><pre>
Subject*Free!!!
Subject*free!!!
Subject*FREE!
Subject*Free!
Subject*free!
Subject*FREE
Subject*Free
Subject*free
FREE!!!
Free!!!
free!!!
FREE!
Free!
free!
FREE

free              
</pre></font>
If you do this, be sure to consider versions with initial
caps as well as all uppercase and all lowercase.  Spams
tend to have more sentences in imperative mood, and in
those the first word is a verb.  So verbs with initial caps
have higher spam probabilities than they would in all 
lowercase.  In my filter, the spam probability of ``Act&apos;&apos;
is 98% and for ``act&apos;&apos; only 62%.<br><br>If you increase your filter&apos;s vocabulary, you can end up
counting the same word multiple times, according to your old
definition of ``same&apos;&apos;.
Logically, they&apos;re not the
same token anymore.  But if this still bothers you, let
me add from experience that the words you seem to be
counting multiple times tend to be exactly the ones you&apos;d
want to.<br><br>Another effect of a larger vocabulary is that when you
look at an incoming mail you find more interesting tokens,
meaning those with probabilities far from .5.  I use the
15 most interesting to decide if mail is spam.
But you can run into a problem when you use a fixed number
like this.  If you find a lot of maximally interesting tokens,
the result can end up being decided by whatever random factor
determines the ordering of equally interesting tokens.
One way to deal with this is to treat some
as more interesting than others.<br><br>For example, the
token ``dalco&apos;&apos; occurs 3 times in my spam corpus and never
in my legitimate corpus.  The token ``Url*optmails&apos;&apos;
(meaning ``optmails&apos;&apos; within a url) occurs 1223 times.
And yet, as I used to calculate probabilities for tokens,
both would have the same spam probability, the threshold of .99.<br><br>That doesn&apos;t feel right.  There are theoretical
arguments for giving these two tokens substantially different
probabilities (Pantel and Lin do), but I haven&apos;t tried that yet.
It does seem at least that if we find more than 15 tokens
that only occur in one corpus or the other, we ought to
give priority to the ones that occur a lot.  So now
there are two threshold values.  For tokens that occur only
in the spam corpus, the probability is .9999 if they
occur more than 10 times and .9998 otherwise.  Ditto
at the other end of the scale for tokens found
only in the legitimate corpus.<br><br>I may later scale token probabilities substantially,
but this tiny amount of scaling at least ensures that 
tokens get sorted the right way.<br><br>Another possibility would be to consider not
just 15 tokens, but all the tokens over a certain
threshold of interestingness.  Steven Hauser does this
in his statistical spam filter [8].
If you use a threshold, make it very high, or
spammers could spoof you by packing messages with
more innocent words.<br><br>Finally, what should one do
about html?  I&apos;ve tried the whole spectrum of options, from
ignoring it to parsing it all.  Ignoring html is a bad idea,
because it&apos;s full of useful spam signs.  But if you parse 
it all, your filter might degenerate into a mere html   
recognizer.  The most effective approach
seems to be the middle course, to notice some tokens but not
others.  I look at a, img, and font tags, and ignore the
rest.  Links and images you should certainly look at, because
they contain urls.<br><br>I could probably be smarter about dealing with html, but I
don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth putting a lot of time into this.
Spams full of html are easy to filter.  The smarter
spammers already avoid it.  So
performance in the future should not depend much on how
you deal with html.<br><br><b>Performance</b><br><br>Between December 10 2002 and January 10 2003 I got about
1750 spams.  
Of these, 4 got through.  That&apos;s a filtering
rate of about 99.75%.<br><br>Two of the four spams I missed got through because they
happened to use words that occur often in my legitimate
email.<br><br>The third was one of those that exploit
an insecure cgi script to send mail to third parties.
They&apos;re hard to filter based just
on the content because the headers are innocent and   
they&apos;re careful about the words they use.  Even so I can
usually catch them.  This one squeaked by with a
probability of .88, just under the threshold of .9.<br><br>Of course, looking at multiple token sequences
would catch it easily.  ``Below is the result of
your feedback form&apos;&apos; is an instant giveaway.<br><br>The fourth spam was what I call
a spam-of-the-future, because this is what I expect spam to
evolve into: some completely neutral
text followed by a url.  In this case it was was from
someone saying they had finally finished their homepage
and would I go look at it.  (The page was of course an    
ad for a porn site.)<br><br>If the spammers are careful about the headers and use a
fresh url, there is nothing in spam-of-the-future for filters
to notice.  We can of course counter by sending a
crawler to look at the page.  But that might not be necessary.
The response rate for spam-of-the-future must
be low, or everyone would be doing it.
If it&apos;s low enough,
it <a href="wfks.html">won&apos;t pay</a> for spammers to send it, and we won&apos;t 
have to work too hard on filtering it.<br><br>Now for the really shocking news: during that same one-month
period I got <i>three</i> false positives.<br><br>In a way it&apos;s
a relief to get some false positives.  When I wrote ``A Plan
for Spam&apos;&apos; I hadn&apos;t had any, and I didn&apos;t know what they&apos;d
be like.  Now that I&apos;ve had a few, I&apos;m relieved to find
they&apos;re not as bad as I feared.
False positives yielded by statistical
filters turn out to be mails that sound a lot like spam, and
these tend to be the ones you would least mind missing [9].<br><br>Two of the false positives were newsletters
from companies I&apos;ve bought things from.  I never
asked to receive them, so arguably they
were spams, but I count them as false positives because
I hadn&apos;t been deleting them as spams before.  The reason
the filters caught them was that both companies in   
January switched to commercial email senders
instead of sending the mails from their own servers,  
and both the headers and the bodies became much spammier.<br><br>The third false positive was a bad one, though.  It was 
from someone in Egypt and written in all uppercase.  This was
a direct result of making tokens case sensitive; the Plan
for Spam filter wouldn&apos;t have caught it.<br><br>It&apos;s hard to say what the overall false positive rate is,
because we&apos;re up in the noise, statistically.
Anyone who has worked on filters (at least, effective filters) will
be aware of this problem.
With some emails it&apos;s
hard to say whether they&apos;re spam or not, and these are
the ones you end up looking at when you get filters       
really tight.  For example, so far the filter has
caught two emails that were sent to my address because
of a typo, and one sent to me in the belief that I was 
someone else.  Arguably, these are neither my spam
nor my nonspam mail.<br><br>Another false positive was from a vice president at Virtumundo.
I wrote to them pretending to be a customer,
and since the reply came back through Virtumundo&apos;s 
mail servers it had the most incriminating
headers imaginable.  Arguably this isn&apos;t a real false
positive either, but a sort of Heisenberg uncertainty
effect: I only got it because I was writing about spam  
filtering.<br><br>Not counting these, I&apos;ve had a total of five false positives
so far, out of about 7740 legitimate emails, a rate of .06%.
The other two were a notice that something I bought
was back-ordered, and a party reminder from Evite.<br><br>I don&apos;t think this number can be trusted, partly
because the sample is so small, and partly because
I think I can fix the filter not to catch
some of these.<br><br>False positives seem to me a different kind of error from
false negatives.
Filtering rate is a measure of performance.  False
positives I consider more like bugs.  I approach improving the
filtering rate as optimization, and decreasing false
positives as debugging.<br><br>So these five false positives are my bug list.  For example, 
the mail from Egypt got nailed because the uppercase text
made it look to the filter like a Nigerian spam.
This really is kind of a bug.  As with
html, the email being all uppercase is really conceptually <i>one</i>
feature, not one for each word.  I need to handle case in a
more sophisticated way.<br><br>So what to make of this .06%?  Not much, I think.  You could
treat it as an upper bound, bearing in mind the small sample size.
But at this stage it is more a measure of the bugs
in my implementation than some intrinsic false positive rate
of Bayesian filtering.<br><br><b>Future</b><br><br>What next?  Filtering is an optimization problem,
and the key to optimization is profiling.  Don&apos;t
try to guess where your code is slow, because you&apos;ll
guess wrong.  <i>Look</i> at where your code is slow,
and fix that.  In filtering, this translates to:   
look at the spams you miss, and figure out what you
could have done to catch them.<br><br>For example, spammers are now working aggressively to   
evade filters, and one of the things they&apos;re doing is
breaking up and misspelling words to prevent filters from
recognizing them.  But working on this is not my first
priority, because I still have no trouble catching these
spams [10].<br><br>There are two kinds of spams I currently do
have trouble with.
One is the type that pretends to be an email from 
a woman inviting you to go chat with her or see her profile on a dating
site.  These get through because they&apos;re the one type of
sales pitch you can make without using sales talk.  They use
the same vocabulary as ordinary email.<br><br>The other kind of spams I have trouble filtering are those
from companies in e.g. Bulgaria offering contract programming 
services.   These get through because I&apos;m a programmer too, and
the spams are full of the same words as my real mail.<br><br>I&apos;ll probably focus on the personal ad type first.  I think if
I look closer I&apos;ll be able to find statistical differences
between these and my real mail.  The style of writing is
certainly different, though it may take multiword filtering
to catch that.
Also, I notice they tend to repeat the url,
and someone including a url in a legitimate mail wouldn&apos;t do that [11].<br><br>The outsourcing type are going to be hard to catch.  Even if 
you sent a crawler to the site, you wouldn&apos;t find a smoking
statistical gun.
Maybe the only answer is a central list of
domains advertised in spams [12].  But there can&apos;t be that
many of this type of mail.  If the only
spams left were unsolicited offers of contract programming
services from Bulgaria, we could all probably move on to
working on something else.<br><br>Will statistical filtering actually get us to that point?
I don&apos;t know.  Right now, for me personally, spam is
not a problem.  But spammers haven&apos;t yet made a serious
effort to spoof statistical filters.  What will happen when they do?<br><br>I&apos;m not optimistic about filters that work at the
network level [13].
When there is a static obstacle worth getting past, spammers
are pretty efficient at getting past it.  There
is already a company called Assurance Systems that will
run your mail through Spamassassin and tell you whether 
it will get filtered out.<br><br>Network-level filters won&apos;t be completely useless.
They may be enough to kill all the &quot;opt-in&quot;
spam, meaning spam from companies like Virtumundo and
Equalamail who claim that they&apos;re really running opt-in lists.
You can filter those based just on the headers, no
matter what they say in the body.  But anyone willing to
falsify headers or use open relays, presumably including
most porn spammers, should be able to get some message past
network-level filters if they want to.  (By no means the
message they&apos;d like to send though, which is something.)<br><br>The kind of filters I&apos;m optimistic about are ones that
calculate probabilities based on each individual user&apos;s mail.
These can be much more effective, not only in
avoiding false positives, but in filtering too: for example,
finding the recipient&apos;s email address base-64 encoded anywhere in
a message is a very good spam indicator.<br><br>But the real advantage of individual filters is that they&apos;ll all be
different.  If everyone&apos;s filters have different probabilities,
it will make the spammers&apos; optimization loop, what programmers
would call their edit-compile-test cycle, appallingly slow.  
Instead of just tweaking a spam till it gets through a copy of
some filter they have on their desktop, they&apos;ll have to do a
test mailing for each tweak.  It would be like programming in
a language without an interactive toplevel, 
and I wouldn&apos;t wish that
on anyone.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1]
Paul Graham.  ``A Plan for Spam.&apos;&apos; August 2002.
http://paulgraham.com/spam.html.<br><br>Probabilities in this algorithm are
calculated using a degenerate case of Bayes&apos; Rule.  There are
two simplifying assumptions: that the probabilities
of features (i.e. words) are independent, and that we know
nothing about the prior probability of an email being
spam.<br><br>The first assumption is widespread in text classification.
Algorithms that use it are called ``naive Bayesian.&apos;&apos;<br><br>The second assumption I made because the proportion of spam in
my incoming mail fluctuated so much from day to day (indeed,
from hour to hour) that the overall prior ratio seemed
worthless as a predictor.  If you assume that P(spam) and
P(nonspam) are both .5, they cancel out and you can
remove them from the formula.<br><br>If you were doing Bayesian filtering in a situation where  
the ratio of spam to nonspam was consistently very high or
(especially) very low, you could probably improve filter
performance by incorporating prior probabilities.  To do
this right you&apos;d have to track ratios by time of day, because
spam and legitimate mail volume both have distinct daily
patterns.<br><br>[2]

``A Bayesian Approach to Filtering Junk E-Mail.&apos;&apos; Proceedings of AAAI-98
Workshop on Learning for Text Categorization.<br><br>[4] At the time I had zero false positives out of about 4,000 
legitimate emails.  If the next legitimate email was
a false positive, this would give us .03%.  These false positive
rates are untrustworthy, as I explain later. I quote
a number here only to emphasize that whatever the false positive rate
is, it is less than 1.16%.
<!--As an indication of how widely divergent these results
are, a filter that simply looked for the word ``click'' would in
August 2002 catch 79.7% of my spam with 1.2% false positives.--><br><br>[5] Bill Yerazunis. ``Sparse Binary Polynomial Hash Message
Filtering and The CRM114 Discriminator.&apos;&apos;  Proceedings of 2003

It seems justifiable to use thresholds proportionate to the
size of the corpora.  Since I now have on the order of 10,000 of each
type of mail, I use .9999 and .0001.<br><br>[7] There is a flaw here I should probably fix.  Currently,
when ``Subject*foo&apos;&apos; degenerates to just ``foo&apos;&apos;, what that means is
you&apos;re getting the stats for occurrences of ``foo&apos;&apos; in
the body or header lines other than those I mark.
What I should do is keep track of statistics for ``foo&apos;&apos;
overall as well as specific versions, and degenerate from
``Subject*foo&apos;&apos; not to ``foo&apos;&apos; but to ``Anywhere*foo&apos;&apos;.  Ditto for
case: I should degenerate from uppercase to any-case, not
lowercase.<br><br>It would probably be a win to do this with prices
too, e.g. to degenerate from ``$129.99&apos;&apos; to ``$--9.99&apos;&apos;, ``$--.99&apos;&apos;,
and ``$--&apos;&apos;.<br><br>You could also degenerate from words to their stems,
but this would probably only improve filtering rates early on

this when comparing techniques for stopping spam.
Whereas many of the false positives caused by filters
will be near-spams that you wouldn&apos;t mind missing,
false positives caused by blacklists, for example, will be just
mail from people who chose the wrong ISP.  In both
cases you catch mail that&apos;s near spam, but for blacklists nearness
is physical, and for filters it&apos;s textual.
<!--
In fairness, it should be added that the new generation of
responsible blacklists, like the SBL, cause far fewer false positives than
earlier blacklists like the MAPS RBL, for whom causing
large numbers of false positives was a deliberate technique
to get the attention of ISPs. --><br><br>[10] If spammers get good enough at obscuring tokens   
for this to be a problem, we can respond by simply removing
whitespace, periods, commas, etc.  and using a dictionary to
pick the words out of the resulting sequence.
And of course finding words this way that weren&apos;t visible in
the original text would in itself be evidence of spam.<br><br>Picking out the words won&apos;t be trivial.  It will require 
more than just reconstructing word boundaries; spammers
both add (``xHot nPorn cSite&apos;&apos;) and omit (``P#rn&apos;&apos;) letters.
Vision research may be useful here, since human vision is
the limit that such tricks will approach.<br><br>[11] 
In general, spams are more repetitive than regular email.   
They want to pound that message home.  I currently don&apos;t
allow duplicates in the top 15 tokens, because
you could get a false positive if the sender happens to use
some bad word multiple times. (In my current filter, ``dick&apos;&apos; has
a spam probabilty of .9999, but it&apos;s also a name.)
It seems we should at least notice duplication though,
so I may try allowing up to two of each token, as Brian Burton does in
SpamProbe.<br><br>[12]  This is what approaches like Brightmail&apos;s will
degenerate into once spammers are pushed into using mad-lib
techniques to generate everything else in the message.<br><br>[13]
It&apos;s sometimes argued that we should be working on filtering
at the network level, because it is more efficient.  What people
usually mean when they say this is: we currently filter at the
network level, and we don&apos;t want to start over from scratch.

size="2" face="verdana">February 2003<br><br>When we were in junior high school, my friend Rich and I made a map
of the school lunch tables according to popularity. This was easy
to do, because kids only ate lunch with others of about the same
popularity. We graded them from A to E. A tables were full of
football players and cheerleaders and so on. E tables contained the
kids with mild cases of Down&apos;s Syndrome, what in the language of
the time we called &quot;retards.&quot;<br><br>We sat at a D table, as low as you could get without looking
physically different. We were not being especially candid to grade
ourselves as D. It would have taken a deliberate lie to say otherwise.
Everyone in the school knew exactly how popular everyone else was,
including us.<br><br>My stock gradually rose during high school. Puberty finally arrived;
I became a decent soccer player; I started a scandalous underground
newspaper.  So I&apos;ve seen a good part of the popularity landscape.<br><br>I know a lot of people who were nerds in school, and they all tell
the same story: there is a strong correlation between being smart
and being a nerd, and an even stronger inverse correlation between
being a nerd and being popular. Being smart seems to <i>make</i> you
unpopular.<br><br>Why? To someone in school now, that may seem an odd question to
ask. The mere fact is so overwhelming that it may seem strange to
imagine that it could be any other way. But it could. Being smart
doesn&apos;t make you an outcast in elementary school. Nor does it harm
you in the real world. Nor, as far as I can tell, is the problem
so bad in most other countries. But in a typical American secondary
school, being smart is likely to make your life difficult.  Why?<br><br><br><br>
The key to this mystery is to rephrase the question slightly. Why
don&apos;t smart kids make themselves popular? If they&apos;re so smart, why
don&apos;t they figure out how popularity works and beat the system,
just as they do for standardized tests?<br><br>One argument says that this would be impossible, that the smart
kids are unpopular because the other kids envy them for being smart,
and nothing they could do could make them popular. I wish. If the
other kids in junior high school envied me, they did a great job
of concealing it. And in any case, if being smart were really an
enviable quality, the girls would have broken ranks. The guys that
guys envy, girls like.<br><br>In the schools I went to, being smart just didn&apos;t matter much. Kids
didn&apos;t admire it or despise it. All other things being equal, they
would have preferred to be on the smart side of average rather than the
dumb side, but intelligence counted far less than, say, physical
appearance, charisma, or athletic ability.<br><br>So if intelligence in itself is not a factor in popularity, why are
smart kids so consistently unpopular? The answer, I think, is that
they don&apos;t really want to be popular.<br><br>If someone had told me that at the time, I would have laughed at
him. Being unpopular in school makes kids miserable, some of them
so miserable that they commit suicide. Telling me that I didn&apos;t
want to be popular would have seemed like telling someone dying of
thirst in a desert that he didn&apos;t want a glass of water. Of course
I wanted to be popular.<br><br>But in fact I didn&apos;t, not enough. There was something else I wanted
more: to be smart. Not simply to do well in school, though that
counted for something, but to design beautiful rockets, or to write
well, or to understand how to program computers. In general, to
make great things.<br><br>At the time I never tried to separate my wants and weigh them
against one another. If I had, I would have seen that being smart
was more important. If someone had offered me the chance to be
the most popular kid in school, but only at the price of being of
average intelligence (humor me here), I wouldn&apos;t have taken it.<br><br>Much as they suffer from their unpopularity, I don&apos;t think many
nerds would. To them the thought of average intelligence is unbearable.
But most kids would take that deal. For half of them, it would be
a step up. Even for someone in the eightieth percentile (assuming,
as everyone seemed to then, that intelligence is a scalar), who
wouldn&apos;t drop thirty points in exchange for being loved and admired
by everyone?<br><br>And that, I think, is the root of the problem. Nerds serve two
masters. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even
more to be smart. And popularity is not something you can do in
your spare time, not in the fiercely competitive environment of an
American secondary school.<br><br><br><br>
Alberti, arguably the archetype of the Renaissance Man, writes that
&quot;no art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you
want to excel in it.&quot;
I wonder if anyone in the world works harder
at anything than American school kids work at popularity. Navy SEALs
and neurosurgery residents seem slackers by comparison. They
occasionally take vacations; some even have hobbies. An American
teenager may work at being popular every waking hour, 365 days a
year.<br><br>I don&apos;t mean to suggest they do this consciously. Some of them truly
are little Machiavellis, but what I really mean here is that teenagers
are always on duty as conformists.<br><br>For example, teenage kids pay a great deal of attention to clothes.
They don&apos;t consciously dress to be popular. They dress to look good.
But to who? To the other kids. Other kids&apos; opinions become their
definition of right, not just for clothes, but for almost everything
they do, right down to the way they walk. And so every effort they
make to do things &quot;right&quot; is also, consciously or not, an effort
to be more popular.<br><br>Nerds don&apos;t realize this. They don&apos;t realize that it takes work to
be popular. In general, people outside some very demanding field
don&apos;t realize the extent to which success depends on constant (though
often unconscious) effort. For example, most people seem to consider
the ability to draw as some kind of innate quality, like being tall.
In fact, most people who &quot;can draw&quot; like drawing, and have spent
many hours doing it; that&apos;s why they&apos;re good at it. Likewise, popular
isn&apos;t just something you are or you aren&apos;t, but something you make
yourself.<br><br>The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things
to think about. Their attention is drawn to books or the natural
world, not fashions and parties. They&apos;re like someone trying to
play soccer while balancing a glass of water on his head. Other
players who can focus their whole attention on the game beat them
effortlessly, and wonder why they seem so incapable.<br><br>Even if nerds cared as much as other kids about popularity, being
popular would be more work for them. The popular kids learned to
be popular, and to want to be popular, the same way the nerds learned
to be smart, and to want to be smart: from their parents. While the
nerds were being trained to get the right answers, the popular kids
were being trained to please.<br><br><br><br>
So far I&apos;ve been finessing the relationship between smart and nerd,
using them as if they were interchangeable. In fact it&apos;s only the
context that makes them so. A nerd is someone who isn&apos;t socially
adept enough. But &quot;enough&quot; depends on where you are. In a typical
American school, standards for coolness are so high (or at least,
so specific) that you don&apos;t have to be especially awkward to look
awkward by comparison.<br><br>Few smart kids can spare the attention that popularity requires.
Unless they also happen to be good-looking, natural athletes, or
siblings of popular kids, they&apos;ll tend to become nerds. And that&apos;s
why smart people&apos;s lives are worst between, say, the ages of eleven
and seventeen. Life at that age revolves far more around popularity
than before or after.<br><br>Before that, kids&apos; lives are dominated by their parents, not by
other kids. Kids do care what their peers think in elementary school,
but this isn&apos;t their whole life, as it later becomes.<br><br>Around the age of eleven, though, kids seem to start treating their
family as a day job. They create a new world among themselves, and
standing in this world is what matters, not standing in their family.
Indeed, being in trouble in their family can win them points in the
world they care about.<br><br>The problem is, the world these kids create for themselves is at
first a very crude one. If you leave a bunch of eleven-year-olds
to their own devices, what you get is <i>Lord of the Flies.</i> Like
a lot of American kids, I read this book in school. Presumably it
was not a coincidence. Presumably someone wanted to point out to
us that we were savages, and that we had made ourselves a cruel and
stupid world. This was too subtle for me. While the book seemed
entirely believable, I didn&apos;t get the additional message. I wish
they had just told us outright that we were savages and our world
was stupid.<br><br><br><br>
Nerds would find their unpopularity more bearable if it merely
caused them to be ignored. Unfortunately, to be unpopular in school
is to be actively persecuted.<br><br>Why? Once again, anyone currently in school might think this a
strange question to ask. How could things be any other way? But
they could be. Adults don&apos;t normally persecute nerds. Why do teenage
kids do it?<br><br>Partly because teenagers are still half children, and many
children are just intrinsically cruel. Some torture nerds for the
same reason they pull the legs off spiders. Before you develop a
conscience, torture is amusing.<br><br>Another reason kids persecute nerds is to make themselves feel
better. When you tread water, you lift yourself up by pushing water
down. Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own
position will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think
rank below. I&apos;ve read that this is why poor whites in the United
States are the group most hostile to blacks.<br><br>But I think the main reason other kids persecute nerds is that it&apos;s
part of the mechanism of popularity. Popularity is only partially
about individual attractiveness. It&apos;s much more about alliances.
To become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that
bring you close to other popular people, and nothing brings people
closer than a common enemy.<br><br>Like a politician who wants to distract voters from bad times at
home, you can create an enemy if there isn&apos;t a real one. By singling
out and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in the
hierarchy create bonds between themselves. Attacking an outsider
makes them all insiders. This is why the worst cases of bullying
happen with groups. Ask any nerd: you get much worse treatment from
a group of kids than from any individual bully, however sadistic.<br><br>If it&apos;s any consolation to the nerds, it&apos;s nothing personal. The
group of kids who band together to pick on you are doing the same
thing, and for the same reason, as a bunch of guys who get together
to go hunting. They don&apos;t actually hate you. They just need something
to chase.<br><br>Because they&apos;re at the bottom of the scale, nerds are a safe target
for the entire school. If I remember correctly, the most popular
kids don&apos;t persecute nerds; they don&apos;t need to stoop to such things.
Most of the persecution comes from kids lower down, the nervous
middle classes.<br><br>The trouble is, there are a lot of them. The distribution of
popularity is not a pyramid, but tapers at the bottom like a pear.
The least popular group is quite small. (I believe we were the only
D table in our cafeteria map.) So there are more people who want
to pick on nerds than there are nerds.<br><br>As well as gaining points by distancing oneself from unpopular kids,
one loses points by being close to them. A woman I know says that
in high school she liked nerds, but was afraid to be seen talking
to them because the other girls would make fun of her. Unpopularity
is a communicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will still
ostracize them in self-defense.<br><br>It&apos;s no wonder, then, that smart kids tend to be unhappy in middle
school and high school. Their other interests leave them little
attention to spare for popularity, and since popularity resembles
a zero-sum game, this in turn makes them targets for the whole
school. And the strange thing is, this nightmare scenario happens
without any conscious malice, merely because of the shape of the
situation.<br><br><br><br>
For me the worst stretch was junior high, when kid culture was new
and harsh, and the specialization that would later gradually separate
the smarter kids had barely begun. Nearly everyone I&apos;ve talked to
agrees: the nadir is somewhere between eleven and fourteen.<br><br>In our school it was eighth grade, which was ages twelve and thirteen
for me. There was a brief sensation that year when one of our
teachers overheard a group of girls waiting for the school bus, and
was so shocked that the next day she devoted the whole class to an
eloquent plea not to be so cruel to one another.<br><br>It didn&apos;t have any noticeable effect. What struck me at the time
was that she was surprised. You mean she doesn&apos;t know the kind of
things they say to one another? You mean this isn&apos;t normal?<br><br>It&apos;s important to realize that, no, the adults don&apos;t know what the
kids are doing to one another. They know, in the abstract, that
kids are monstrously cruel to one another, just as we know in the
abstract that people get tortured in poorer countries. But, like
us, they don&apos;t like to dwell on this depressing fact, and they don&apos;t
see evidence of specific abuses unless they go looking for it.<br><br>Public school teachers are in much the same position as prison
wardens. Wardens&apos; main concern is to keep the prisoners on the
premises. They also need to keep them fed, and as far as possible
prevent them from killing one another. Beyond that, they want to
have as little to do with the prisoners as possible, so they leave
them to create whatever social organization they want. From what
I&apos;ve read, the society that the prisoners create is warped, savage,
and pervasive, and it is no fun to be at the bottom of it.<br><br>In outline, it was the same at the schools I went to. The most
important thing was to stay on the premises. While there, the
authorities fed you, prevented overt violence, and made some effort
to teach you something. But beyond that they didn&apos;t want to have
too much to do with the kids. Like prison wardens, the teachers
mostly left us to ourselves. And, like prisoners, the culture we
created was barbaric.<br><br><br><br>
Why is the real world more hospitable to nerds? It might seem that
the answer is simply that it&apos;s populated by adults, who are too
mature to pick on one another. But I don&apos;t think this is true.
Adults in prison certainly pick on one another. And so, apparently,
do society wives; in some parts of Manhattan, life for women sounds
like a continuation of high school, with all the same petty intrigues.<br><br>I think the important thing about the real world is not that it&apos;s
populated by adults, but that it&apos;s very large, and the things you
do have real effects. That&apos;s what school, prison, and ladies-who-lunch
all lack. The inhabitants of all those worlds are trapped in little
bubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect.
Naturally these societies degenerate into savagery. They have no
function for their form to follow.<br><br>When the things you do have real effects, it&apos;s no longer enough
just to be pleasing. It starts to be important to get the right
answers, and that&apos;s where nerds show to advantage. Bill Gates will
of course come to mind. Though notoriously lacking in social skills,
he gets the right answers, at least as measured in revenue.<br><br>The other thing that&apos;s different about the real world is that it&apos;s
much larger. In a large enough pool, even the smallest minorities
can achieve a critical mass if they clump together. Out in the real
world, nerds collect in certain places and form their own societies
where intelligence is the most important thing. Sometimes the current
even starts to flow in the other direction: sometimes, particularly
in university math and science departments, nerds deliberately
exaggerate their awkwardness in order to seem smarter. John Nash
so admired Norbert Wiener that he adopted his habit of touching the
wall as he walked down a corridor.<br><br><br><br>
As a thirteen-year-old kid, I didn&apos;t have much more experience of
the world than what I saw immediately around me. The warped little
world we lived in was, I thought, <i>the world.</i> The world seemed cruel
and boring, and I&apos;m not sure which was worse.<br><br>Because I didn&apos;t fit into this world, I thought that something must
be wrong with me. I didn&apos;t realize that the reason we nerds didn&apos;t
fit in was that in some ways
we were a step ahead. We were already thinking about
the kind of things that matter in the real world, instead of spending
all our time playing an exacting but mostly pointless game like the
others.<br><br>We were a bit like an adult would be if he were thrust back into
middle school. He wouldn&apos;t know the right clothes to wear, the right
music to like, the right slang to use. He&apos;d seem to the kids a
complete alien. The thing is, he&apos;d know enough not to care what
they thought. We had no such confidence.<br><br>A lot of people seem to think it&apos;s good for smart kids to be thrown
together with &quot;normal&quot; kids at this stage of their lives. Perhaps.
But in at least some cases the reason the nerds don&apos;t fit in really
is that everyone else is crazy. I remember sitting in the audience
at a &quot;pep rally&quot; at my high school, watching as the cheerleaders
threw an effigy of an opposing player into the audience to be torn
to pieces. I felt like an explorer witnessing some bizarre tribal
ritual.<br><br><br><br>
If I could go back and give my thirteen year old self some advice,
the main thing I&apos;d tell him would be to stick his head up and look
around. I didn&apos;t really grasp it at the time, but the whole world
we lived in was as fake as a Twinkie. Not just school, but the
entire town. Why do people move to suburbia? To have kids! So no
wonder it seemed boring and sterile. The whole place was a giant
nursery, an artificial town created explicitly for the purpose of
breeding children.<br><br>Where I grew up, it felt as if there was nowhere to go, and nothing
to do. This was no accident. Suburbs are deliberately designed to
exclude the outside world, because it contains things that could
endanger children.<br><br>And as for the schools, they were just holding pens within this
fake world. Officially the purpose of schools is to teach kids. In
fact their primary purpose is to keep kids locked up in one
place for a big chunk of the day so adults can get things done. And
I have no problem with this: in a specialized industrial society,
it would be a disaster to have kids running around loose.<br><br>What bothers me is not that the kids are kept in prisons, but that
(a) they aren&apos;t told about it, and (b) the prisons are run mostly
by the inmates. Kids are sent off to spend six years memorizing
meaningless facts in a world ruled by a caste of giants who run
after an oblong brown ball, as if this were the most natural thing
in the world. And if they balk at this surreal cocktail, they&apos;re
called misfits.<br><br><br><br>
Life in this twisted world is stressful for the kids. And not just
for the nerds. Like any war, it&apos;s damaging even to the winners.<br><br>Adults can&apos;t avoid seeing that teenage kids are tormented. So why
don&apos;t they do something about it? Because they blame it on puberty.
The reason kids are so unhappy, adults tell themselves, is that
monstrous new chemicals, <i>hormones</i>, are now coursing through their
bloodstream and messing up everything. There&apos;s nothing wrong with
the system; it&apos;s just inevitable that kids will be miserable at
that age.<br><br>This idea is so pervasive that even the kids believe it, which
probably doesn&apos;t help. Someone who thinks his feet naturally hurt
is not going to stop to consider the possibility that he is wearing
the wrong size shoes.<br><br>I&apos;m suspicious of this theory that thirteen-year-old kids are
intrinsically messed up. If it&apos;s physiological, it should be
universal. Are Mongol nomads all nihilists at thirteen? I&apos;ve read
a lot of history, and I have not seen a single reference
to this supposedly universal fact before the twentieth century.
Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance seem to have been cheerful
and eager. They got in fights and played tricks on one another of
course (Michelangelo had his nose broken by a bully), but they
weren&apos;t crazy.<br><br>As far as I can tell, the concept of the hormone-crazed teenager
is coeval with suburbia. I don&apos;t think this is a coincidence. I
think teenagers are driven crazy by the life they&apos;re made to lead.
Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance were working dogs. Teenagers
now are neurotic lapdogs. Their craziness is the craziness of the
idle everywhere.<br><br><br><br>
When I was in school, suicide was a constant topic among the smarter
kids. No one I knew did it, but several planned to, and
some may have tried. Mostly this was just a pose. Like other
teenagers, we loved the dramatic, and suicide seemed very dramatic.
But partly it was because our lives were at times genuinely miserable.<br><br>Bullying was only part of the problem. Another problem, and possibly
an even worse one, was that we never had anything real to work on.
Humans like to work; in most of the world, your work is your identity.
And all the work we did was 
<a href="essay.html">pointless</a>, or seemed so at the time.<br><br>At best it was practice for real work we might do far in the future,
so far that we didn&apos;t even know at the time what we were practicing
for. More often it was just an arbitrary series of hoops to jump
through, words without content designed mainly for testability.
(The three main causes of the Civil War were....
Test: List the three main causes of the Civil War.)<br><br>And there was no way to opt out. The adults had agreed among
themselves that this was to be the route to college. The only way
to escape this empty life was to submit to it.<br><br><br><br>
Teenage kids used to have a more active role in society. In
pre-industrial times, they were all apprentices of one sort or
another, whether in shops or on farms or even on warships. They
weren&apos;t left to create their own societies. They were junior members
of adult societies.<br><br>Teenagers seem to have respected adults more then, because
the adults were the visible experts in the skills they were trying
to learn. Now most kids have little idea what their parents do in
their distant offices, and see no connection (indeed, there is
precious little) between schoolwork and the work they&apos;ll do as
adults.<br><br>And if teenagers respected adults more, adults also had more use
for teenagers. After a couple years&apos; training, an apprentice could
be a real help. Even the newest apprentice could be made to carry
messages or sweep the workshop.<br><br>Now adults have no immediate use for teenagers. They would be in
the way in an office. So they drop them off at school on their way
to work, much as they might drop the dog off at a kennel if they  
were going away for the weekend.<br><br>What happened? We&apos;re up against a hard one here. The cause of this
problem is the same as the cause of so many present ills: specialization.
As jobs become more specialized, we have to train longer for them.
Kids in pre-industrial times started working at about 14 at
the latest; kids on farms, where most people lived, began far  
earlier. Now kids who go to college don&apos;t start working full-time 
till 21 or 22. With some degrees, like MDs and PhDs, you may not
finish your training till 30.<br><br>Teenagers now are useless, except as cheap labor in industries like
fast food, which evolved to exploit precisely this fact. In almost
any other kind of work, they&apos;d be a net loss. But they&apos;re also too 
young to be left unsupervised. Someone has to watch over them, and
the most efficient way to do this is to collect them together in
one place. Then a few adults can watch all of them.<br><br>If you stop there, what you&apos;re describing is literally a prison,
albeit a part-time one. The problem is, many schools practically
do stop there. The stated purpose of schools is to educate the kids.
But there is no external pressure to do this well. And so most
schools do such a bad job of teaching that the kids don&apos;t really
take it seriously-- not even the smart kids. Much of the time we
were all, students and teachers both, just going through the motions.<br><br>In my high school French class we were supposed to read Hugo&apos;s <i>Les
Miserables.</i> I don&apos;t think any of us knew French well enough to make
our way through this enormous book. Like the rest of the class, I   
just skimmed the Cliff&apos;s Notes. When we were given a test on the
book, I noticed that the questions sounded odd. They were full of   
long words that our teacher wouldn&apos;t have used. Where had these   
questions come from? From the Cliff&apos;s Notes, it turned out. The 
teacher was using them too. We were all just pretending.<br><br>There are certainly great public school teachers.  The energy and 
imagination of my fourth grade teacher, Mr. Mihalko, made that  
year something his students still talk about, thirty years later.
But teachers like him were individuals swimming
upstream. They couldn&apos;t fix the system.<br><br><br><br>
In almost any group of people you&apos;ll find hierarchy.
When groups of adults form in the real world, it&apos;s generally for  
some common purpose, and the leaders end up being those who are best
at it. The problem with most schools is, they have no purpose. 
But hierarchy there must be.
And so the kids make one out of nothing.<br><br>We have a phrase to describe what happens when rankings have to be
created without any meaningful criteria. We say that the situation
<i>degenerates into a popularity contest.</i> And that&apos;s exactly what
happens in most American schools.
Instead of depending on some real test, one&apos;s rank
depends mostly on one&apos;s ability to increase one&apos;s rank. It&apos;s
like the court of Louis XIV. There is no external opponent, so the
kids become one another&apos;s opponents.<br><br>When there is some real external test of skill, it isn&apos;t painful
to be at the bottom of the hierarchy. A rookie on a football team
doesn&apos;t resent the skill of the veteran; he hopes to be like him
one day and is happy to have the chance to learn from him.
The veteran may in turn feel a sense of
<i>noblesse oblige</i>.
And most importantly, their status depends on how well they
do against opponents, not on whether they can push the other down.<br><br>Court hierarchies are another thing entirely. This type of society
debases anyone who enters it. There is neither admiration at the 
bottom, nor <i>noblesse oblige</i> at the top. It&apos;s kill or be killed.<br><br>This is the sort of society that gets created
in American
secondary schools. And it happens because these schools have no
real purpose beyond keeping the kids all in one place for a certain
number of hours each day. What I didn&apos;t realize at the time, and
in fact didn&apos;t realize till very recently, is that the twin horrors
of school life, the cruelty and the boredom, both have the same  
cause.<br><br><br><br>
The mediocrity of American public schools has worse consequences
than just making kids unhappy for six years. It breeds a rebelliousness
that actively drives kids away from the things they&apos;re supposed to
be learning.<br><br>Like many nerds, probably, it was years after high school before I
could bring myself to read anything we&apos;d been assigned then.
And I lost more than books. I mistrusted words like &quot;character&quot; and   
&quot;integrity&quot; because they had been so debased by adults. As they
were used then, these words all seemed to mean the same thing:
obedience. The kids who got praised for these qualities tended to 
be at best dull-witted prize bulls, and at worst facile schmoozers.
If that was what character and integrity were, I wanted no part of
them.<br><br>The word I most misunderstood was &quot;tact.&quot; As used by adults, it
seemed to mean keeping your mouth shut.
I assumed it was derived from the same root as
&quot;tacit&quot; and &quot;taciturn,&quot; and that it literally meant being quiet. I
vowed that I would never be tactful; they were never going to shut
me up. In fact, it&apos;s derived from the same root as &quot;tactile,&quot; and
what it means is to have a deft touch. Tactful is the opposite of
clumsy. I don&apos;t think I learned this until college.<br><br><br><br>Nerds aren&apos;t the only losers in the popularity rat race. Nerds are
unpopular because they&apos;re distracted. There are other kids who
deliberately opt out because they&apos;re so disgusted with the whole  
process.<br><br>Teenage kids, even rebels, don&apos;t like to be alone, so when kids opt
out of the system, they tend to do it as a group. At the schools I
went to, the focus of rebellion was drug use, specifically marijuana.
The kids in this tribe wore black concert t-shirts and were called
&quot;freaks.&quot;<br><br>Freaks and nerds were allies, and there was a good deal of overlap
between them. Freaks were on the whole smarter than other kids,
though never studying (or at least never appearing to) was an   
important tribal value. I was more in the nerd camp, but I was
friends with a lot of freaks.<br><br>They used drugs, at least at first, for the social bonds they
created. It was something to do together, and because the drugs 
were illegal, it was a shared badge of rebellion.<br><br>I&apos;m not claiming that bad schools are the whole reason kids get
into trouble with drugs. After a while, drugs have their own momentum.
No doubt some of the freaks ultimately used drugs to escape from  
other problems-- trouble at home, for example. But, in my school
at least, the reason most kids <i>started</i> using drugs was rebellion.
Fourteen-year-olds didn&apos;t start smoking pot because they&apos;d heard
it would help them forget their problems. They started because they
wanted to join a different tribe.<br><br>Misrule breeds rebellion; this is not a new idea. And yet the
authorities still for the most part act as if drugs were themselves
the cause of the problem.<br><br><br><br>
The real problem is the emptiness of school life. We won&apos;t see
solutions till adults realize that. The adults who
may realize it first are the ones who were themselves nerds in  
school. Do you want your kids to be as unhappy in eighth grade as
you were? I wouldn&apos;t. Well, then, is there anything we can do to
fix things? Almost certainly. There is nothing inevitable about the
current system. It has come about mostly by default.<br><br>Adults, though, are busy. Showing up for school plays is one thing.
Taking on the educational bureaucracy is another. Perhaps a few
will have the energy to try to change things. I suspect the hardest  
part is realizing that you can.<br><br>Nerds still in school should not hold their breath. Maybe one day
a heavily armed force of adults will show up in helicopters to      
rescue you, but they probably won&apos;t be coming this month. Any     
immediate improvement in nerds&apos; lives is probably going to have to
come from the nerds themselves.<br><br>Merely understanding the situation they&apos;re in should make it less 
painful. Nerds aren&apos;t losers. They&apos;re just playing a different game,
and a game much closer to the one played in the real world. Adults
know this. It&apos;s hard to find successful adults now who don&apos;t claim
to have been nerds in high school.<br><br>It&apos;s important for nerds to realize, too, that school is not life.
School is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half feral.
It&apos;s all-encompassing, like life, but it isn&apos;t the real thing. It&apos;s
only temporary, and if you look, you can see beyond it even while
you&apos;re still in it.<br><br>If life seems awful to kids, it&apos;s neither because hormones are 
turning you all into monsters (as your parents believe), nor because
life actually is awful (as you believe). It&apos;s because the adults,
who no longer have any economic use for you, have abandoned you to
spend years cooped up together with nothing real to do.  <i>Any</i> society
of that type is awful to live in.
You don&apos;t have
to look any further to explain why teenage kids are unhappy.<br><br>I&apos;ve said some harsh things in this essay, but really the thesis
is an optimistic one-- that several problems we take for granted
are in fact not insoluble after all. Teenage kids are not inherently
unhappy monsters. That should be encouraging news to kids and adults
both.<br><br><br><br>

size="2" face="verdana">April 2003<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a keynote talk at PyCon 2003.)</i><br><br>It&apos;s hard to predict what
life will be like in a hundred years.  There are only a few
things we can say with certainty.  We know that everyone will
drive flying cars,
that zoning laws will be relaxed to allow buildings
hundreds of stories tall, that it will be dark most of the
time, and that women will all be trained in the martial arts.  
Here I want to zoom in on one detail of this
picture.  What kind of programming language will they use to
write the software controlling those flying cars?<br><br>This is worth thinking about not so
much because we&apos;ll actually get to use these languages as because,
if we&apos;re lucky, we&apos;ll use languages on the path from this
point to that.<br><br><br><br>I think that, like species, languages will form evolutionary trees,
with dead-ends branching off all over.  We can see this
happening already.
Cobol, for all its sometime popularity, does not seem to have any
intellectual descendants.  It is an evolutionary dead-end-- a
Neanderthal language.<br><br>I predict a similar fate for Java.  People
sometimes send me mail saying, &quot;How can you say that Java
won&apos;t turn out to be a successful language?  It&apos;s already
a successful language.&quot;  And I admit that it is, if you
measure success by shelf space taken up by books on it
(particularly individual books on it), or by
the number of undergrads who believe they have to
learn it to get a job.  When I say Java won&apos;t
turn out to be a successful language, I mean something more
specific:  that Java
will turn out to be an evolutionary dead-end, like Cobol.<br><br>This is just a guess.  I may be wrong.  My point here is not to dis Java,
but to raise the issue of evolutionary
trees and get people asking, where on the tree is language X?
The reason to ask this question isn&apos;t just so that
our ghosts can say, in a
hundred years, I told you so.  It&apos;s because staying close to  
the main branches is a useful heuristic for finding languages that will
be good to program in now.<br><br>At any given time, you&apos;re probably happiest on
the main branches of an evolutionary tree.
Even when there were still plenty of Neanderthals, 
it must have sucked to be one.  The
Cro-Magnons would have been constantly coming over and
beating you up and stealing your food.<br><br>The reason I want to
know what languages will be like in a hundred years is so that
I know what branch of the tree to bet on now.<br><br><br><br>The evolution of languages differs from the evolution of species
because branches can converge.  The Fortran branch, for example,
seems to be merging with the descendants
of Algol.  In theory this is possible for species too, but it&apos;s
not likely to have happened to any bigger than a cell.<br><br>Convergence
is more likely for languages partly because the space of
possibilities is smaller, and partly because mutations
are not random.  Language designers deliberately incorporate
ideas from other languages.<br><br>It&apos;s especially useful for language designers to think
about where the evolution of programming languages is likely
to lead, because they can steer accordingly. 
In that case, &quot;stay on a main branch&quot; becomes more than a
way to choose a good language.
It becomes a heuristic for making the right decisions about
language design.<br><br><br><br>Any programming language can be divided into
two parts:  some set of fundamental operators that play the role
of axioms, and the rest of the language, which could in principle
be written in terms of these fundamental operators.<br><br>I think the fundamental operators are the most important factor in a
language&apos;s long term survival.  The rest you can change.  It&apos;s
like the rule that in buying a house you should consider
location first of all.  Everything else you can fix later, but you
can&apos;t fix the location.<br><br>I think it&apos;s important not just that the axioms be well chosen, 
but that there be few of them.  Mathematicians have always felt 
this way about axioms-- the fewer, the better-- and I think they&apos;re
onto something.<br><br>At the very least, it has to be a useful exercise to look closely
at the core of a language to see if there are any axioms that
could be weeded out.  I&apos;ve found in my long career as a slob that
cruft breeds cruft, and I&apos;ve seen this happen in software as
well as under beds and in the corners of rooms.<br><br>I have a hunch that
the main branches of the evolutionary tree pass through the languages
that have the smallest, cleanest cores.
The more of a language you can write in itself,
the better.<br><br><br><br>Of course, I&apos;m making a big assumption in even asking what
programming languages will be like in a hundred years.
Will we even be writing programs in a hundred years?  Won&apos;t
we just tell computers what we want them to do?<br><br>There hasn&apos;t been a lot of progress in that department
so far.
My guess is that a hundred years from now people will
still tell computers what to do using programs we would recognize
as such.  There may be tasks that we
solve now by writing programs and which in a hundred years
you won&apos;t have to write programs to solve, but I think
there will still be a good deal of
programming of the type that we do today.<br><br>It may seem presumptuous to think anyone can predict what
any technology will look like in a hundred years.  But
remember that we already have almost fifty years of history behind us.
Looking forward a hundred years is a graspable idea
when we consider how slowly languages have evolved in the
past fifty.<br><br>Languages evolve slowly because they&apos;re not really technologies.
Languages are notation.  A program is a formal description of 
the problem you want a computer to solve for you.  So the rate
of evolution in programming languages is more like the
rate of evolution in mathematical notation than, say,
transportation or communications.
Mathematical notation does evolve, but not with the giant
leaps you see in technology.<br><br><br><br>Whatever computers are made of in a hundred years, it seems  
safe to predict they will be much faster than
they are now.  If Moore&apos;s Law continues to put out, they will be 74
quintillion (73,786,976,294,838,206,464) times faster.  That&apos;s kind of
hard to imagine.  And indeed, the most likely prediction in the
speed department may be that Moore&apos;s Law will stop working.
Anything that is supposed to double every eighteen months seems
likely to run up against some kind of fundamental limit eventually.
But I have no trouble believing that computers will be very much
faster. Even if they only end up being a paltry million
times faster, that should change the ground rules for programming
languages substantially.  Among other things, there
will be more room for what
would now be considered slow languages, meaning languages
that don&apos;t yield very efficient code.<br><br>And yet some applications will still demand speed.
Some of the problems we want to solve with
computers are created by computers; for example, the
rate at which you have to process video images depends
on the rate at which another computer can
generate them.  And there is another class of problems
which inherently have an unlimited capacity to soak up cycles:
image rendering, cryptography, simulations.<br><br>If some applications can be increasingly inefficient while
others continue to demand all the speed the hardware can
deliver, faster computers will mean that languages have
to cover an ever wider range of efficiencies.  We&apos;ve seen
this happening already.  Current implementations of some
popular new languages are shockingly wasteful by the
standards of previous decades.<br><br>This isn&apos;t just something that happens with programming
languages.  It&apos;s a general historical trend.  As technologies improve,
each generation can do things that the previous generation
would have considered wasteful.  People thirty years ago would
be astonished at how casually we make long distance phone calls.
People a hundred years ago would be even more astonished that 
a package would one day travel from Boston to New York via Memphis.<br><br><br><br>I can already tell you what&apos;s going to happen to all those extra
cycles that faster hardware is going to give us in the   
next hundred years.  They&apos;re nearly all going to be wasted.<br><br>I learned to program when computer power was scarce.
I can remember taking all the spaces out of my Basic programs
so they would fit into the memory of a 4K TRS-80.  The
thought of all this stupendously inefficient software
burning up cycles doing the same thing over and over seems
kind of gross to me.  But I think my intuitions here are wrong.  I&apos;m
like someone who grew up poor, and can&apos;t bear to spend money
even for something important, like going to the doctor.<br><br>Some kinds of waste really are disgusting.  SUVs, for example, would
arguably be gross even if they ran on a fuel which would never
run out and generated no pollution.  SUVs are gross because they&apos;re
the solution to a gross problem. (How to make minivans look more
masculine.)
But not all waste is bad.  Now that we have the infrastructure
to support it, counting the minutes of your long-distance
calls starts to seem niggling.   If you have the
resources, it&apos;s more elegant to think of all phone calls as
one kind of thing, no matter where the other person is.<br><br>There&apos;s good waste, and bad waste.  I&apos;m interested
in good waste-- the kind where, by spending more, we can get  
simpler designs.  How will we take advantage of the opportunities
to waste cycles that we&apos;ll get from new, faster hardware?<br><br>The desire for speed is so deeply engrained in us, with 
our puny computers, that it will take a conscious effort
to overcome it.  In language design, we should be consciously seeking out
situations where we can trade efficiency for even the
smallest increase in convenience.<br><br><br><br>Most data structures exist because of speed.  For example,
many languages today have both strings and lists.  Semantically, strings
are more or less a subset of lists in which the elements are
characters.  So why do you need a separate data type?
You don&apos;t, really.  Strings only
exist for efficiency.  But it&apos;s lame to clutter up the semantics
of the language with hacks to make programs run faster.
Having strings in a language seems to be a case of
premature optimization.<br><br>If we think of the core of a language as a set of axioms,  
surely it&apos;s gross to have additional axioms that add no expressive
power, simply for the sake of efficiency.  Efficiency is
important, but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s the right way to get it.<br><br>The right way to solve that problem, I think, is to separate
the meaning of a program from the implementation details. 
Instead of having both lists and strings, have just lists,
with some way to give the compiler optimization advice that 
will allow it to lay out strings as contiguous bytes if
necessary.<br><br>Since speed doesn&apos;t matter in most of a program, you won&apos;t
ordinarily need to bother with
this sort of micromanagement.
This will be more and more true as computers get faster.<br><br><br><br>Saying less about implementation should also make programs
more flexible.
Specifications change while a program is being written, and this is not
only inevitable, but desirable.<br><br>The word &quot;essay&quot; comes
from the French verb &quot;essayer&quot;, which means &quot;to try&quot;.
An essay, in the original sense, is something you
write to try to figure something out.  This happens in
software too.  I think some of the best programs were essays,
in the sense that the authors didn&apos;t know when they started
exactly what they were trying to write.<br><br>Lisp hackers already know about the value of being flexible
with data structures.  We tend to write the first version of
a program so that it does everything with lists.  These
initial versions can be so shockingly inefficient that it
takes a conscious effort not to think about what they&apos;re
doing, just as, for me at least, eating a steak requires a
conscious effort not to think where it came from.<br><br>What programmers in a hundred years will be looking for, most of
all, is a language where you can throw together an unbelievably
inefficient version 1 of a program with the least possible
effort.  At least, that&apos;s how we&apos;d describe it in present-day
terms.  What they&apos;ll say is that they want a language that&apos;s
easy to program in.<br><br>Inefficient software isn&apos;t gross.  What&apos;s gross is a language
that makes programmers do needless work.  Wasting programmer time
is the true inefficiency, not wasting machine time.  This will
become ever more clear as computers get faster.<br><br><br><br>I think getting rid of strings is already something we
could bear to think about.  We did it in <a href="arc.html">Arc</a>, and it seems
to be a win;  some operations that would be awkward to
describe as regular expressions can be described
easily as recursive functions.<br><br>How far will this flattening of data structures go?  I can think
of possibilities that shock even me, with my conscientiously broadened
mind.  Will we get rid of arrays, for example?  After all, they&apos;re
just a subset of hash tables where the keys are vectors of
integers.   Will we replace hash tables themselves with lists?<br><br>There are more shocking prospects even than that.  The Lisp
that McCarthy described in 1960, for example, didn&apos;t
have numbers.  Logically, you don&apos;t need to have a separate notion
of numbers, because you can represent them as lists:  the integer
n could be represented as a list of n elements.  You can do math this
way.  It&apos;s just unbearably inefficient.<br><br>No one actually proposed implementing numbers as lists in
practice.  In fact, McCarthy&apos;s 1960 paper was not, at the time,
intended to be implemented at all.  It was a <a href="rootsoflisp.html">theoretical exercise</a>,
an attempt to create a more elegant alternative to the Turing
Machine.  When someone did, unexpectedly, take this paper and
translate it into a working Lisp interpreter, numbers certainly
weren&apos;t represented as lists; they were represented in binary,
as in every other language.<br><br>Could a programming language go so far as to get rid of numbers
as a fundamental data type?  I ask this not so much as a serious
question as as a way to play chicken with the future.  It&apos;s like
the hypothetical case of an irresistible force meeting an 
immovable object-- here, an unimaginably inefficient
implementation meeting unimaginably great resources.
I don&apos;t see why not.  The future is pretty long.  If there&apos;s
something we can do to decrease the number of axioms in the core
language, that would seem to be the side to bet on as t approaches
infinity.  If the idea still seems unbearable in a hundred years,
maybe it won&apos;t in a thousand.<br><br>Just to be clear about this, I&apos;m not proposing that all numerical
calculations would actually be carried out using lists.  I&apos;m proposing
that the core language, prior to any additional notations about
implementation, be defined this way.  In practice any program
that wanted to do any amount of math would probably represent
numbers in binary, but this would be an optimization, not part of
the core language semantics.<br><br><br><br>Another way to burn up cycles is to have many layers of
software between the application and the hardware.  This too is
a trend we see happening already: many recent languages are
compiled into byte code.  Bill Woods once told me that,
as a rule of thumb, each layer of interpretation costs a
factor of 10 in speed.  This extra cost buys you flexibility.<br><br>The very first version of Arc was an extreme case of this sort
of multi-level slowness, with corresponding benefits.  It
was a classic &quot;metacircular&quot; interpreter written
on top of Common Lisp, with a definite family resemblance
to the eval function defined in McCarthy&apos;s original Lisp paper.
The whole thing was only a couple hundred lines of
code, so it was very easy to understand and change.  The 
Common Lisp we used, CLisp, itself runs on top
of a byte code interpreter.  So here we had two levels of
interpretation, one of them (the top one) shockingly inefficient,
and the language was usable.  Barely usable, I admit, but
usable.<br><br>Writing software as multiple layers is a powerful technique
even within applications.  Bottom-up programming means writing
a program as a series of layers, each of which serves as a
language for the one above.  This approach tends to yield
smaller, more flexible programs.  It&apos;s also the best route to   
that holy grail, reusability.  A language is by definition
reusable.  The more
of your application you can push down into a language for writing
that type of application, the more of your software will be 
reusable.<br><br>Somehow the idea of reusability got attached
to object-oriented programming in the 1980s, and no amount of
evidence to the contrary seems to be able to shake it free.  But
although some object-oriented software is reusable, what makes
it reusable is its bottom-upness, not its object-orientedness.
Consider libraries: they&apos;re reusable because they&apos;re language,
whether they&apos;re written in an object-oriented style or not.<br><br>I don&apos;t predict the demise of object-oriented programming, by the
way.  Though I don&apos;t think it has much to offer good programmers,
except in certain specialized domains, it is irresistible to   
large organizations.  Object-oriented programming
offers a sustainable way to write spaghetti code.  It lets you accrete
programs as a series of patches.
<!--, without the effort of understanding, 
or the risk of breaking, existing code. -->
Large organizations
always tend to develop software this way, and I expect this
to be as true in a hundred years as it is today.<br><br><br><br>
As long as we&apos;re talking about the future, we had better
talk about parallel computation, because that&apos;s where this 
idea seems to live.  That is, no matter when you&apos;re talking, parallel
computation seems to be something that is going to happen
in the future.<br><br>Will the future ever catch up with it?  People have been
talking about parallel computation as something imminent 
for at least 20
years, and it hasn&apos;t affected programming practice much so far.
Or hasn&apos;t it?  Already
chip designers have to think about it, and so must
people trying to write systems software on multi-cpu computers.<br><br>The real question is, how far up the ladder of abstraction will
parallelism go?
In a hundred years will it affect even application programmers?  Or
will it be something that compiler writers think about, but
which is usually invisible in the source code of applications?<br><br>One thing that does seem likely is that most opportunities for
parallelism will be wasted.  This is a special case of my more   
general prediction that most of the extra computer power we&apos;re
given will go to waste.  I expect that, as with the stupendous
speed of the underlying hardware, parallelism will be something
that is available if you ask for it explicitly, but ordinarily
not used.  This implies that the kind of parallelism we have in
a hundred years will not, except in special applications, be
massive parallelism.  I expect for
ordinary programmers it will be more like being able to fork off
processes that all end up running in parallel.<br><br>And this will, like asking for specific implementations of data
structures, be something that you do fairly late in the life of a
program, when you try to optimize it.  Version 1s will ordinarily
ignore any advantages to be got from parallel computation, just
as they will ignore advantages to be got from specific representations
of data.<br><br>Except in special kinds of applications, parallelism won&apos;t
pervade the programs that are written in a hundred years.  It would be
premature optimization if it did.<br><br><br><br>How many programming languages will there
be in a hundred years?  There seem to be a huge number of new
programming languages lately.  Part of the reason is that
faster hardware has allowed programmers to make different
tradeoffs between speed and convenience, depending on the
application.  If this is a real trend, the hardware we&apos;ll  
have in a hundred years should only increase it.<br><br>And yet there may be only a few widely-used languages in a
hundred years.  Part of the reason I say this
is optimism: it seems that, if you did a really good job,
you could make a language that was ideal for writing a   
slow version 1, and yet with the right optimization advice
to the compiler, would also yield very fast code when necessary.
So, since I&apos;m optimistic, I&apos;m going to predict that despite
the huge gap they&apos;ll have between acceptable and maximal
efficiency, programmers in a hundred years will have languages 
that can span most of it.<br><br>As this gap widens, profilers will become increasingly important.
Little attention is paid to profiling now.  Many people still
seem to believe that the way to get fast applications is to
write compilers that generate fast code.  As the gap between    
acceptable and maximal performance widens, it will become
increasingly clear that the way to get fast applications is   
to have a good guide from one to the other.<br><br>When I say there may only be a few languages, I&apos;m not including
domain-specific &quot;little languages&quot;.  I think such embedded languages
are a great idea, and I expect them to proliferate.  But I expect
them to be written as thin enough skins that users can see
the general-purpose language underneath.<br><br><br><br>Who will design the languages of the future?  One of the most exciting
trends in the last ten years has been the rise of open-source  
languages like Perl, Python, and Ruby.
Language design is being taken over by hackers.  The results
so far are messy, but encouraging.  There are some stunningly  
novel ideas in Perl, for example. Many are stunningly bad, but
that&apos;s always true of ambitious efforts.  At its current rate
of mutation, God knows what Perl might evolve into in a hundred
years.<br><br>It&apos;s not true that those who can&apos;t do, teach (some of the best
hackers I know are professors), but it is true that there are a
lot of things that those who teach can&apos;t do.  <a href="desres.html">Research</a> imposes
constraining caste restrictions.  In any academic
field there are topics that are ok to work on and others that
aren&apos;t.  Unfortunately the distinction between acceptable and
forbidden topics is usually based on how intellectual
the work sounds when described in research papers, rather than
how important it is for getting good results.  The extreme case
is probably literature; people studying literature rarely  
say anything that would be of the slightest use to those
producing it.<br><br>Though the situation is better in the sciences,
the overlap between the kind of work you&apos;re allowed to do and the
kind of work that yields good languages is distressingly small.
(Olin Shivers has grumbled eloquently
about this.)  For example, types seem to be an inexhaustible source
of research papers, despite the fact that static typing
seems to preclude true macros-- without which, in my opinion, no
language is worth using.<br><br>The trend is not merely toward languages being developed
as open-source projects rather than &quot;research&quot;, but toward
languages being designed by the application programmers who need
to use them, rather than by compiler writers.  This seems a good
trend and I expect it to continue.<br><br><br><br>
Unlike physics in a hundred years, which is almost necessarily
impossible to predict, I think it may be possible in principle
to design a language now that would appeal to users in a hundred
years.<br><br>One way to design a language is to just write down the program
you&apos;d like to be able to write, regardless of whether there 
is a compiler that can translate it or hardware that can run it.
When you do this you can assume unlimited resources.  It seems
like we ought to be able to imagine unlimited resources as well
today as in a hundred years.<br><br>What program would one like to write?  Whatever is least work.
Except not quite: whatever <i>would be</i> least work if your ideas about
programming weren&apos;t already influenced by the languages you&apos;re 
currently used to.  Such influence can be so pervasive that   
it takes a great effort to overcome it.  You&apos;d think it would
be obvious to creatures as lazy as us how to express a program
with the least effort.  In fact, our ideas about what&apos;s possible
tend to be so <a href="avg.html">limited</a> by whatever language we think in  that
easier formulations of programs seem very surprising.  They&apos;re
something you have to discover, not something you naturally
sink into.<br><br>One helpful trick here
is to use the <a href="power.html">length</a> of the program as an approximation for
how much work it is to write.  Not the length in characters,
of course, but the length in distinct syntactic elements-- basically,
the size of the parse tree.  It may not be quite true that
the shortest program is the least work to write, but it&apos;s
close enough that you&apos;re better off aiming for the solid
target of brevity than the fuzzy, nearby one of least work.
Then the algorithm for language design becomes: look at a program
and ask, is there any way to write this that&apos;s shorter?<br><br>In practice, writing programs in an imaginary hundred-year
language will work to varying degrees depending
on how close you are to the core.  Sort routines you can
write now.  But it would be
hard to predict now what kinds of libraries might be needed in
a hundred years.  Presumably many libraries will be for domains that
don&apos;t even exist yet.  If SETI@home works, for example, we&apos;ll  
need libraries for communicating with aliens.  Unless of course
they are sufficiently advanced that they already communicate
in XML.<br><br>At the other extreme, I think you might be able to design the
core language today.  In fact, some might argue that it was already
mostly designed in 1958.<br><br><br><br>If the hundred year language were available today, would we
want to program in it?  One way to answer this question is to
look back.  If present-day programming languages had been available
in 1960, would anyone have wanted to use them?<br><br>In some ways, the answer is no.  Languages today assume
infrastructure that didn&apos;t exist in 1960.  For example, a language
in which indentation is significant, like Python, would not
work very well on printer terminals.  But putting such problems
aside-- assuming, for example, that programs were all just
written on paper-- would programmers of the 1960s have liked
writing programs in the languages we use now?<br><br>I think so.
Some of the less imaginative ones,
who had artifacts of early languages built into their ideas of  
what a program was, might have had trouble.  (How can you manipulate
data without doing pointer arithmetic?  How can you implement 
flow charts without gotos?)  But I think the smartest programmers
would have had no trouble making the most of present-day
languages, if they&apos;d had them.<br><br>If we had the hundred-year language now, it would at least make a
great pseudocode.  What about using it to write software?   
Since the hundred-year language
will need to generate fast code for some applications, presumably
it could generate code efficient enough to run acceptably well
on our hardware.  We might have to give more optimization advice
than users in a hundred years, but it still might be a net win.<br><br><br><br>Now we have two ideas that, if you combine them, suggest interesting
possibilities: (1) the hundred-year language could, in principle, be
designed today, and (2) such a language, if it existed, might be good to
program in today.  When you see these ideas laid out like that,
it&apos;s hard not to think, why not try writing the hundred-year language
now?<br><br>When you&apos;re working on language design, I think it is good to
have such a target and to keep it consciously in mind.  When you
learn to drive, one of the principles they teach you is to
align the car not by lining up the hood with the stripes painted
on the road, but by aiming at some point in the distance.  Even
if all you care about is what happens in the next ten feet, this
is the right answer.  I
think we can and should do the same thing with programming languages.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>I believe Lisp Machine Lisp was the first language to embody
the principle that declarations (except those of dynamic variables)
were merely optimization advice,
and would not change the meaning of a correct program.  Common Lisp
seems to have been the first to state this explicitly.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Robert Morris, and Dan Giffin for

I was    
asked this question by a student in the audience at a 
talk I gave recently.  Not for the first time, either.<br><br>In languages, as in so many things, there&apos;s not much     
correlation between popularity and quality.  Why does   
John Grisham (<i>King of Torts</i> sales rank, 44) outsell
Jane Austen (<i>Pride and Prejudice</i> sales rank, 6191)?
Would even Grisham claim that it&apos;s because he&apos;s a better
writer?<br><br>Here&apos;s the first sentence of <i>Pride and Prejudice:</i>
<blockquote>
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man 
in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a
wife.
</blockquote>
&quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged?&quot;  Long words for
the first sentence of a love story.<br><br>Like Jane Austen, Lisp looks hard.  Its syntax, or lack
of syntax, makes it look completely <a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/acl2.lisp">unlike</a> 
the languages
most people are used to.  Before I learned Lisp, I was afraid
of it too.  I recently came across a notebook from 1983
in which I&apos;d written:
<blockquote>
I suppose I should learn Lisp, but it seems so foreign.
</blockquote>
Fortunately, I was 19 at the time and not too resistant to learning
new things.  I was so ignorant that learning
almost anything meant learning new things.<br><br>People frightened by Lisp make up other reasons for not
using it.  The standard
excuse, back when C was the default language, was that Lisp
was too slow.  Now that Lisp dialects are among
the <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/benchmark.php?test=nestedloop&amp;lang=all&amp;sort=cpu">faster</a>
languages available, that excuse has gone away.
Now the standard excuse is openly circular: that other languages
are more popular.<br><br>(Beware of such reasoning.  It gets you Windows.)<br><br>Popularity is always self-perpetuating, but it&apos;s especially
so in programming languages. More libraries
get written for popular languages, which makes them still
more popular.  Programs often have to work with existing programs,
and this is easier if they&apos;re written in the same language,
so languages spread from program to program like a virus.
And managers prefer popular languages, because they give them 
more leverage over developers, who can more easily be replaced.<br><br>Indeed, if programming languages were all more or less equivalent,
there would be little justification for using any but the most
popular.  But they <a href="icad.html">aren&apos;t</a> all equivalent, not by a long
shot.  And that&apos;s why less popular languages, like Jane Austen&apos;s 
novels, continue to survive at all.  When everyone else is reading 
the latest John Grisham novel, there will always be a few people 
reading Jane Austen instead.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.shiro.dreamhost.com/scheme/trans/iflisp-j.html">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://ro.goobix.com/pg/iflisp/">Romanian Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://cibercalli.com/erick/hackingnews/lispnews/si-lisp-es-tan-grandioso">Spanish Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="hp">Hackers and Painters</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">May 2003<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a guest lecture at Harvard, which incorporated
an earlier talk at Northeastern.)</i><br><br>When I finished grad school in computer science I went
to art school to study painting.  A lot of people seemed surprised
that someone interested in computers would also be interested in painting.
They seemed to think that
hacking and painting were very different kinds of work-- that
hacking was cold, precise, and methodical, and that
painting was the frenzied expression of some primal urge.<br><br>Both of these images are wrong.  Hacking and painting have a
lot in common.  In fact, of all the different types of people I&apos;ve
known, hackers and painters are among the most alike.<br><br>What hackers and painters have in common is that they&apos;re
both makers.  Along with composers, architects, and writers,
what hackers and painters are trying to do is make good things.
They&apos;re not doing research per se, though if in the course of
trying to make good things they discover some new technique,
so much the better.<br><br><br><br>I&apos;ve never liked the term &quot;computer science.&quot;  The main
reason I don&apos;t like it is that there&apos;s no such thing.
Computer science is a
grab bag of tenuously related areas thrown together
by an accident of history, like Yugoslavia.
At one end you have people who are really mathematicians,
but call what they&apos;re doing computer science so they can get DARPA grants.
In the middle you have people working on
something like the natural history of computers-- studying the
behavior of algorithms for routing data through
networks, for example.  And then at the other extreme you
have the hackers, who are trying to
write interesting software, and for whom computers are just a
medium of expression, as concrete is for architects or
paint for painters.  It&apos;s as if
mathematicians, physicists, and architects all had to be in
the same department.<br><br>Sometimes what the hackers do is called &quot;software engineering,&quot;
but this term is just as misleading.
Good software designers are no more engineers than architects are.
The border between architecture and engineering is not sharply
defined, but it&apos;s there.
It falls between what and how: architects decide what to do,
and engineers figure out how to do it.<br><br>What and how should not be kept too separate.  You&apos;re
asking for trouble if you try to decide what to do without
understanding how to do it.
But hacking can certainly be more than just deciding how to
implement some spec.  At its best, it&apos;s creating the spec-- though
it turns out the best way to do that is to implement it.<br><br><br><br>Perhaps one day
&quot;computer science&quot; will, like Yugoslavia, get broken up into its
component parts.  That might be a good thing.  Especially if it
meant independence for my native land, hacking.<br><br>Bundling all these different types of work together in one
department may be convenient administratively, but it&apos;s confusing
intellectually. That&apos;s the other reason I don&apos;t like the name
&quot;computer science.&quot;  Arguably the people in the middle are doing
something like an experimental science.  But the people at either
end, the hackers and the mathematicians, are not actually doing science.<br><br>The mathematicians don&apos;t seem bothered by this.  They happily
set to work proving theorems like the other mathematicians
over in the math department, and probably soon stop noticing
that the building they work in says ``computer science&apos;&apos; on the
outside.  But for the hackers this label is a problem.
If what they&apos;re doing is called science, it makes them feel they
ought to be acting scientific.
So instead of doing what they really want to do, which is   
to design beautiful software, hackers in universities and
research labs feel they ought to be writing research papers.<br><br>In the best case, the papers are just a formality.  Hackers write
cool software, and then write a paper about it, and the paper
becomes a proxy for the achievement represented by the software.
But often this mismatch causes problems.  It&apos;s easy to
drift away from building beautiful things toward building ugly
things that make more suitable subjects for research papers.<br><br>Unfortunately, beautiful things don&apos;t always make the
best subjects for papers.
Number one, research must be original-- and
as anyone who has written a PhD dissertation knows, the way to
be sure that you&apos;re exploring virgin territory is to to stake
out a piece of ground that no one wants.  Number two, research must be
substantial-- and awkward systems yield meatier papers,
because you can write about the obstacles you have to overcome
in order to get things done.  Nothing yields meaty problems like
starting with the wrong assumptions.  Most of AI is an example
of this rule; if you assume that knowledge can be represented
as a list of predicate logic expressions whose arguments represent
abstract concepts, you&apos;ll have a lot of
papers to write about how to make this work.  As Ricky Ricardo
used to say, &quot;Lucy, you got a lot of explaining to do.&quot;<br><br>The way to create something beautiful is often to make subtle
tweaks to something that already exists, or to combine existing
ideas in a slightly new way.  This kind of work is hard to
convey in a research paper.<br><br><br><br>So why do universities and research labs continue to judge
hackers by publications?
For the same reason that &quot;scholastic aptitude&quot;
gets measured by simple-minded standardized tests, or
the productivity of programmers gets measured in lines of code.
These tests
are easy to apply, and there is nothing so tempting as an easy test
that kind of works.<br><br>Measuring what hackers are actually trying to do, designing
beautiful software, would be much more difficult.  You need
a good <a href="taste.html">sense of design</a> to judge 
good design.  And
there is no correlation, except possibly
a <a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/features/psp7761121.pdf">negative</a> 
one, between people&apos;s ability to recognize good
design and their confidence that they can.<br><br>The only external test is time.  Over time, beautiful
things tend to thrive, and ugly
things tend to get discarded.  Unfortunately, the amounts of time
involved can be longer than human lifetimes.  Samuel Johnson
said it took a hundred years for a writer&apos;s reputation to
converge.  You have to wait for the writer&apos;s
influential friends to die, and then for all their followers
to die.<br><br>I think hackers just have to resign themselves to having a large random
component in their reputations.  In this they are no different
from other makers.  In fact, they&apos;re lucky by comparison.   
The influence of fashion is not nearly so great in hacking as it
is in painting.<br><br><br><br>There are worse things than having people misunderstand your
work.  A worse danger is that you
will yourself misunderstand your work.  Related fields are
where you go looking for ideas.  If you find yourself in the computer science
department, there is a natural temptation to believe, for example,
that hacking is the applied version of what theoretical computer
science is the theory of.   All
the time I was in graduate school I had an uncomfortable feeling
in the back of my mind that I ought to know more theory,
and that it was very remiss of me to have forgotten all that
stuff within three weeks of the final exam.<br><br>Now I realize I was
mistaken.  Hackers need to understand the theory of computation
about as much as painters need to understand paint chemistry.
You need to know how to calculate time and
space complexity and about
Turing completeness.  You might also want to remember at
least the concept of a state machine, in case you have to write
a parser or a regular expression library.  Painters in fact   
have to remember a good deal more about paint chemistry than 
that.<br><br>I&apos;ve found that the best sources of ideas
are not the other fields that have the word &quot;computer&quot; in
their names, but the other fields inhabited by makers.
Painting has been a much richer source of ideas than the
theory of computation.<br><br>For example, I was taught in college
that one ought to figure out a program
completely on paper
before even going near a computer.  I found that I did not
program this way.  I found that I liked to program
sitting in front of a computer, not a piece of paper.  Worse
still, instead of patiently writing out a complete program
and assuring myself it was correct, I tended to just spew
out code that was hopelessly broken, and gradually beat it into
shape.  Debugging, I was taught, was a kind of final pass where
you caught typos and oversights.  The way I worked, it
seemed like programming consisted of debugging.<br><br>For a long time I felt bad about this, just as I once
felt bad that I didn&apos;t hold my pencil the way they taught me
to in elementary school.
If I had only looked over at
the other makers, the painters or the architects, I would
have realized that there was a name for what I was doing:
sketching.  As far as I can tell, the
way they taught me to program in college was all wrong.
You should figure out programs as you&apos;re writing them,
just as writers and painters and architects do.<br><br>Realizing this has real implications for software design.
It means that a programming language should, above all, be
malleable.  A programming language is for 
<a href="piraha.html">thinking</a> of
programs, not for expressing programs you&apos;ve already thought
of.  It should be a pencil, not a pen.  Static typing would
be a fine idea if people actually did write programs the way
they taught me to in college.  But that&apos;s not how any of the  
hackers I know write programs.  We need a language that lets us
scribble and smudge and smear, not a language where you have
to sit with a teacup of types balanced on your knee and make
polite conversation with a strict old aunt of a compiler.<br><br><br><br>While we&apos;re on the subject of static typing, identifying with
the makers will save us from another problem that afflicts
the sciences: math envy.  Everyone in the sciences
secretly believes that mathematicians are smarter than they are.  
I think mathematicians also believe this.  At any rate,
the result is that scientists tend to make their
work look as mathematical as possible.  In a field like
physics this probably doesn&apos;t do much harm, but the further you
get from the natural sciences, the more of a problem it
becomes.<br><br>A page of formulas just looks so impressive.
(Tip: for extra impressiveness, use Greek variables.)  And
so there is a great temptation to work on problems you
can treat formally, rather than problems that are, say,
important.<br><br>If hackers identified with other makers, like writers and
painters, they wouldn&apos;t feel tempted to do      
this.  Writers and painters don&apos;t suffer from math envy.
They feel as if they&apos;re doing something completely unrelated.
So are hackers, I think.<br><br><br><br>If universities and research labs keep hackers from doing
the kind of work they want to do,
perhaps the place for them is in companies.
Unfortunately, most companies won&apos;t let hackers do what they
want either.  Universities and research labs force hackers
to be scientists, and companies force them to be engineers.<br><br>I only discovered this myself quite recently.  When Yahoo bought
Viaweb, they asked me what I wanted to do.  I had never
liked the business side very much, and said that I just wanted to
hack.  When I got to Yahoo, I found that what hacking meant
to them was implementing software, not designing it.  Programmers
were seen as technicians who translated the visions (if
that is the word) of product managers into code.<br><br>This seems to be the
default plan in big companies.  They do it because
it decreases the standard deviation of the outcome.
Only a small percentage of hackers can actually design software,
and it&apos;s hard for the
people running a company to pick these out.  So instead of
entrusting the future of the software to
one brilliant hacker, most companies set things up so that it is
designed by committee, and the hackers merely
implement the design.<br><br>If you want to make money at some point, remember this,
because this is one of the reasons startups win.  Big companies want
to decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes because they
want to avoid disasters.  But when you damp oscillations, you
lose the high points as well as the low.  This is not a problem for
big companies, because they don&apos;t win by making great
products.  Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies.<br><br>So if you can figure out a way to get in a
design war with a company big enough that its software is   
designed by product managers, they&apos;ll never be able to keep up
with you.  These opportunities are not easy to find, though.
It&apos;s hard to engage a big company in a design war,
just as it&apos;s hard to engage an opponent inside a castle in hand
to hand combat.  It would be pretty easy to write a better
word processor than Microsoft Word, for example, but Microsoft,
within the castle of their operating system monopoly,
probably wouldn&apos;t even notice if you did.<br><br>The place to fight design wars is in new markets, where no one
has yet managed to establish any fortifications.  That&apos;s where
you can win big by taking the bold approach to design, and
having the same people both design and implement the product.  
Microsoft themselves did this at the start.  So did Apple.
And Hewlett-Packard.  I suspect almost every successful startup
has.<br><br><br><br>So one way to build great software is to start your own
startup.  There are two problems with this, though.  One is
that in a startup you have to do so much besides write software.
At Viaweb I considered myself lucky if I
got to hack a quarter of the time.  And the things I had to   
do the other three quarters of the time ranged from tedious
to terrifying.  I have a benchmark for this, because I
once had to leave a board meeting to have
some cavities filled.  I remember sitting back in the
dentist&apos;s chair, waiting for the drill, and feeling like
I was on vacation.<br><br>The other problem with startups is that there is not much
overlap between the kind of software that makes money and the
kind that&apos;s interesting to write.  Programming languages
are interesting to write, and Microsoft&apos;s first product was
one, in fact, but no one will pay for programming languages
now.  If you want to make money, you tend to be forced to work
on problems that are too nasty for anyone to solve for free.<br><br>All makers face this problem.  Prices are
determined by supply and demand, and there is just not as much
demand for things that are fun to work on as there is for
things that solve the mundane problems of individual customers.
Acting in off-Broadway plays just doesn&apos;t pay as well as
wearing a gorilla suit in someone&apos;s booth at a
trade show.  Writing novels doesn&apos;t pay as well as writing
ad copy for garbage disposals.
And hacking programming languages doesn&apos;t pay as well
as figuring out how to connect some company&apos;s
legacy database to their Web server.<br><br><br><br>I think the answer to this problem, in the case of software,
is a concept known to nearly all makers: the day job.
This phrase began with musicians, who
perform at night.  More generally, it means that you have one
kind of work you do for money, and another for love.<br><br>Nearly all makers have day jobs early in their careers.
Painters and writers notoriously do.  If you&apos;re lucky
you can get a day job that&apos;s closely
related to your real work.  Musicians often
seem to work in record stores.  A hacker working on some
programming language or operating system might likewise be able to
get a day job using it.  [1]<br><br>When I say that the answer is for hackers to have day jobs, 
and work on beautiful software on the side, I&apos;m not proposing
this as a new idea.  This is what open-source hacking is all   
about.  What I&apos;m saying is that open-source is probably the right
model, because it has been independently confirmed by all the  
other makers.<br><br>It seems surprising to me that any employer would be reluctant
to let hackers work on open-source projects.
At Viaweb, we would have been reluctant to hire anyone
who didn&apos;t.  When we interviewed
programmers, the main
thing we cared about was what kind of software they
wrote in their spare time.
You can&apos;t do anything really well unless
you love it, and if you love to hack you&apos;ll inevitably
be working on projects of your own. [2]<br><br><br><br>Because hackers are makers rather than scientists,
the right place to look for metaphors is not in the
sciences, but among other kinds of makers.  What else can painting
teach us about hacking?<br><br>One thing we can learn, or at least confirm, from the
example of painting is how to learn to hack.  You learn to
paint mostly by doing it.
Ditto for hacking.  Most hackers don&apos;t learn to hack by
taking college courses in programming.  They learn to hack
by writing programs of their own at age thirteen.  Even in   
college classes, you learn to hack mostly by hacking. [3]<br><br>Because painters leave a trail of work behind them, you
can watch them learn by doing.  If you look at the work
of a painter in chronological order, you&apos;ll find that each  
painting builds on things that have been learned in previous
ones.  When there&apos;s something in
a painting that works very well, you can usually find version 
1 of it in a smaller form in some earlier painting.<br><br>I think most makers work this way.  Writers and architects seem
to as well.  Maybe it would be good for hackers
to act more like painters, and regularly start over from scratch,
instead of continuing to work for years on one project, and
trying to incorporate all their later ideas as revisions.<br><br>The fact that hackers learn to hack by doing it is another
sign of how different hacking is from the sciences.  Scientists
don&apos;t learn science by doing it, but by doing labs and problem sets.
Scientists start out doing work that&apos;s perfect, in the sense
that they&apos;re just trying to reproduce work someone else has 
already done for them.
Eventually, they get
to the point where they can do original work.
Whereas hackers, from the start, are doing original work; it&apos;s
just very bad.  So hackers start original, and get good, and
scientists start good, and get original.<br><br><br><br>
The other way makers learn is from examples.
For a painter, a museum is a reference library of techniques.
For hundreds of years it has been part of the traditional
education of painters to copy the works of the great masters,
because copying forces you to look closely
at the way a painting is made.<br><br>Writers do this too.
Benjamin Franklin learned to write by summarizing the points   
in the essays of Addison and Steele and then trying to
reproduce them.  Raymond Chandler did the same thing
with detective stories.<br><br>Hackers, likewise, can learn to program by looking at 
good programs-- not just at what they do, but the source
code too.  One of the less publicized benefits
of the open-source movement is that it has made it easier
to learn to program.  When I learned to program, we had to rely
mostly on examples in books.  The one big chunk of
code available then was Unix, but even this was not   
open source.  Most of the people who read the source
read it in illicit photocopies of John Lions&apos; book, which
though written in 1977 was not allowed to be published
until 1996.<br><br><br><br>Another example we can take from painting is the way that
paintings are created by gradual refinement.  Paintings usually
begin with a sketch.
Gradually the details get filled in.
But it is not merely a process of filling in. Sometimes   
the original plans turn out to be mistaken.
Countless paintings,
when you look at them in xrays, turn out to have limbs that
have been moved or facial features that have been readjusted.<br><br>Here&apos;s a case where we can learn from painting.  I think hacking
should work this way too.  It&apos;s unrealistic
to expect that the specifications for a program will be
perfect. You&apos;re
better off if you admit this up front, and write programs in
a way that allows specifications to change on the fly.<br><br>(The structure of large companies makes this hard for them
to do, so here is another place where startups have an advantage.)<br><br>Everyone by now presumably knows about the danger of premature
optimization.  I think we should be just as worried about
premature design-- deciding too early what
a program should do.<br><br>The right tools can help us avoid
this danger.
A good programming language should, like oil paint, make it
easy to change your mind.  Dynamic typing is a win here because
you don&apos;t have to
commit to specific data representations up front.
But the key to flexibility, I think, is to make the language
very <a href="power.html">abstract</a>.
The easiest program to change is one that&apos;s very short.<br><br><br><br>
This sounds like a paradox, but a great painting
has to be better than it has to be.
For example, when Leonardo
painted the portrait of <a href="ginevra.html">Ginevra de Benci</a>
in the National Gallery, he put a juniper bush behind her head.
In it he carefully
painted each individual leaf.  Many painters might have thought,
this is just something to put in the background to frame
her head.  No one will look that closely at it.<br><br>Not Leonardo.  How hard he worked on part of a painting didn&apos;t
depend at all on how closely he expected anyone to look at it.
He was like Michael Jordan.  Relentless.<br><br>Relentlessness wins because, in the aggregate, unseen details
become visible.
When people walk by the portrait of Ginevra de Benci,
their attention is often immediately arrested by it,
even before they look at the label and notice that it says
Leonardo da Vinci.  All those unseen details combine to produce
something that&apos;s just stunning, like a thousand barely audible
voices all singing in tune.<br><br>Great software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to
beauty.  If you look inside good software, you find that
parts no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too.
I&apos;m not claiming I write great software, but I
know that when it comes to code I behave in a way that would
make me eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everyday
life the same way.
It drives me crazy to see code that&apos;s badly indented,
or that uses ugly variable names.<br><br><br><br>If a hacker were a mere implementor, turning a spec into code, then
he could just work his way through it from one end to the other like
someone digging a ditch.  But if the hacker is a creator, we have
to take inspiration into account.<br><br>In hacking, like painting,
work comes in cycles.  Sometimes you get excited about some
new project and you want to work sixteen hours a day on it. 
Other times nothing seems interesting.<br><br>To do good work you have to take these cycles into
account, because they&apos;re affected by how you react to them.
When you&apos;re driving a
car with a manual transmission on a hill, you have to back off
the clutch sometimes to avoid stalling.  Backing
off can likewise prevent ambition from stalling.
In both painting and hacking there are some
tasks that are terrifyingly ambitious, and others that are
comfortingly routine.  It&apos;s a good idea to save some easy
tasks for moments when you would otherwise stall.<br><br>In hacking, this can literally mean saving up bugs.
I like debugging: it&apos;s the
one time that hacking is as straightforward as   
people think it is.  You have a
totally constrained problem, and all you have to do is solve
it.  Your program is supposed to do x.  Instead it does y.
Where does it go wrong? You know you&apos;re going to win
in the end.  It&apos;s as relaxing as painting a wall.<br><br><br><br>The example of painting can teach us not only how to manage our
own work, but how to work together.  A lot of the
great art of the past is the work of multiple hands, though
there may only be one name on the wall next to it in the
museum.  Leonardo was an apprentice in the workshop of
Verrocchio and painted one of the angels in his <a href="baptism.html">Baptism of
Christ</a>.  This sort of thing was the rule, not the exception.
Michelangelo was considered especially dedicated for insisting
on painting all the figures on the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel himself.<br><br>As far as I know, when painters worked together on a painting,
they never worked on the same parts.  It was common
for the master to paint the principal figures and for assistants
to paint the others and the background.  But you never had
one guy painting over the work of another.<br><br>I think this is the right model for collaboration in software
too.  Don&apos;t push it too far.  When a piece of code is
being hacked by three or four different people, no one of whom
really owns it, it will end up being like a common-room.  It will
tend to feel bleak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft.
The right
way to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharply
defined modules, each with a definite owner, and with interfaces
between them that are as carefully designed and, if possible,
as articulated as programming languages.<br><br><br><br>Like painting, most software is intended for
a human audience.  And so hackers, like painters, must have
empathy to do really great work.  You have to be able to see
things from the user&apos;s point of view.<br><br>When I was a kid I was always being told to look at things from
someone else&apos;s point of view.  What this always meant in
practice was to do what someone else wanted, instead of what
I wanted.  This of course gave empathy a bad name, and I made a
point of not cultivating it.<br><br>Boy, was I wrong.  It turns out that looking at things from 
other people&apos;s point of view is practically the secret of
success.  It doesn&apos;t necessarily mean being self-sacrificing.
Far from it.  Understanding how someone else sees things
doesn&apos;t imply that you&apos;ll act in his interest; in some
situations-- in war, for example-- you want to do exactly
the opposite. [4]<br><br>Most makers make things for a human audience.
And to engage an audience you have to understand what they need.
Nearly all the greatest paintings are paintings of people,
for example, because people are what people are interested in.<br><br>Empathy is probably the single most important difference
between a good hacker and a great one.  Some hackers
are quite smart, but when it comes to empathy are
practically solipsists.  It&apos;s hard for such      
people to design great software [5], because they can&apos;t
see things from the user&apos;s point of view.<br><br>One way to tell how good people are at empathy is to watch
them explain a technical question to someone without a technical
background.  We probably all know people who, though otherwise smart,
are just comically bad at this.  If someone asks them at
a dinner party what a programming language is, they&apos;ll
say something like ``Oh, a high-level language is what
the compiler uses as input to generate object code.&apos;&apos;
High-level language?  Compiler?  Object code?  Someone who 
doesn&apos;t know what a programming language is obviously doesn&apos;t
know what these things are, either.<br><br>Part of what software has to do is explain itself.  So to   
write good software you have to understand how little users   
understand.
They&apos;re going to walk up to the software with no preparation, and
it had better do what they guess it will, because they&apos;re
not going to read the manual.  The best system I&apos;ve ever seen 
in this respect was the original Macintosh, in 1985.
It did what software almost never does: it just worked. [6]<br><br>Source code, too, should explain itself.  If I could get people to
remember just one quote about programming, it would be the
one at the beginning of <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs.</i>  
<blockquote>
Programs should be written for people to read, and
only incidentally for machines to execute.
</blockquote>
You need to have 
empathy not just for your users, but for your readers.  It&apos;s in  
your interest, because you&apos;ll be one of them.
Many a hacker has written a program only to
find on returning to it six months later that he has no idea   
how it works.  I know several people who&apos;ve sworn off Perl after
such experiences. [7]<br><br>Lack of empathy is associated with intelligence, to the point
that there is even something of a fashion for it in some places.
But I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any correlation.
You can do well in math and
the natural sciences without having to learn empathy, and people in these
fields tend to be smart, so the two qualities have come to be
associated.  But there are plenty of dumb people who are bad at
empathy too.  Just listen to the people who call in with questions on
talk shows.  They ask whatever it is they&apos;re asking in
such a roundabout way
that the hosts often have to rephrase the question for them.<br><br><br><br>So, if hacking works like painting and writing, is it as cool?
After all, you only get one life.
You might as well spend it working on something great.<br><br>Unfortunately, the question is hard to answer.  There is always
a big time lag in prestige.  It&apos;s like light from a distant star.
Painting has prestige now because of great work people did five hundred
years ago.  At the time, no one thought
these paintings were as important as we do today.  It would have
seemed very odd to people at the time that Federico da Montefeltro,
the Duke of Urbino, would one day be known mostly as the guy
with the strange nose in a <a href="montefeltro.html">painting</a> 
by Piero della Francesca.<br><br>So while I admit that hacking doesn&apos;t seem as cool as painting now,
we should remember that painting itself didn&apos;t seem as cool in
its glory days as it does now.<br><br>What we can say with some confidence is that these are the glory
days of hacking.  In most fields the great work is done early on.
The paintings made between 1430 and 1500 are still unsurpassed.
Shakespeare appeared just as professional theater was being born,
<!-- plays were emerging from crude farces put
on in the courtyards of coaching inns, -->
and pushed the medium
so far that every playwright since has had to live in his shadow.
Albrecht Durer did the same thing with engraving, and Jane Austen
with the novel.<br><br>Over and over we see the same pattern.  A new medium appears, and
people are so excited about it that they explore most of its
possibilities in the first couple generations.   Hacking seems
to be in this phase now.<br><br>Painting was not, in Leonardo&apos;s time, as cool as his work
helped make it.
How cool hacking turns out to be will depend on what we can
do with this new medium.  
<!--In some ways, the time lag of
coolness is an advantage.  When you meet someone now who is
writing a compiler or hacking a Unix kernel, at least
you know they're not just doing it to pick up chicks.--><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] The greatest damage that photography has done
to painting may be the fact that it killed the best day job.
Most of the great painters in history supported
themselves by painting portraits.  <!-- Until about 1870, there
was always a cadre of painters trained in the most
difficult task in art, painting the human face from life.  --><br><br>[2] I&apos;ve been told that Microsoft discourages
employees from contributing to open-source projects, even in
their spare time.
But so many of the best hackers work on open-source
projects now that the main effect of this policy may be
to ensure that they won&apos;t be able to hire any first-rate
programmers.<br><br>[3] What you learn about programming in college is much like
what you learn about books or clothes or dating: what bad taste you
had in high school.<br><br>[4] Here&apos;s an example of applied empathy.
At Viaweb, if we couldn&apos;t decide between two alternatives, we&apos;d
ask, what would our competitors hate most?  At one point a
competitor added a feature to their software that was basically
useless, but since it was one of few they had that we didn&apos;t, they
made much of it in the trade press.
We could have tried to explain that the feature was useless,
but we decided it would annoy our competitor more if we
just implemented it ourselves, so we hacked together our own
version that afternoon.<br><br>[5] Except text editors and compilers.  Hackers don&apos;t need empathy to
design these, because they are themselves typical users.<br><br>[6] Well, almost.  They overshot the available RAM somewhat,
causing much inconvenient disk swapping, but this could be fixed
within a few months by buying an additional disk drive.<br><br>[7] The way to make programs easy to read is not to
stuff them with comments. I would take Abelson and Sussman&apos;s
quote a step further.  Programming languages should be designed
to express algorithms, and only incidentally to tell computers
how to execute them.  A good programming language
ought to be better for explaining software than English.
You should only
need comments when there is some kind of kludge you need to warn
readers about, just as on a road there are only
arrows on parts with unexpectedly sharp curves.

-->
We may be able to improve the accuracy of Bayesian spam filters
by having them follow links to see what&apos;s
waiting at the other end.  Richard Jowsey of
<a href="http://death2spam.com">death2spam</a> now does
this in borderline cases, and reports that it works well.<br><br>Why only do it in borderline cases?  And why only do it once?<br><br>As I mentioned in <a href="wfks.html">Will Filters Kill Spam?</a>,
following all the urls in
a spam would have an amusing side-effect.  If popular email clients
did this in order to filter spam, the spammer&apos;s servers
would take a serious pounding.  The more I think about this,
the better an idea it seems.  This isn&apos;t just amusing; it
would be hard to imagine a more perfectly targeted counterattack
on spammers.<br><br>So I&apos;d like to suggest an additional feature to those
working on spam filters: a &quot;punish&quot; mode which,
if turned on, would spider every url
in a suspected spam n times, where n could be set by the user. [1]<br><br>As many people have noted, one of the problems with the
current email system is that it&apos;s too passive.  It does
whatever you tell it.  So far all the suggestions for fixing
the problem seem to involve new protocols.  This one  
wouldn&apos;t.<br><br>If widely used, auto-retrieving spam filters would make
the email system <i>rebound.</i>  The huge volume of the
spam, which has so far worked in the spammer&apos;s favor,
would now work against him, like a branch snapping back in   
his face.   Auto-retrieving spam filters would drive the
spammer&apos;s 
<a href="http://www.bork.ca/pics/?path=incoming&amp;img=bill.jpg">costs</a> up, 
and his sales down:  his bandwidth usage
would go through the roof, and his servers would grind to a
halt under the load, which would make them unavailable
to the people who would have responded to the spam.<br><br>Pump out a million emails an hour, get a
million hits an hour on your servers.<br><br><!--Of course, if any of the urls
are "web bugs" they'll suggest to the spammer that
the mail got opened, and may result in more spam.  (However,
they'll also tend to make "open rates" meaningless, thus
depriving the spammer of valuable information.)
And of course, some links will be unsubscribe links.  The
net effect might be less spam.
-->
We would want to ensure that this is only done to
suspected spams.  As a rule, any url sent to millions of
people is likely to be a spam url, so submitting every http
request in every email would work fine nearly all the time.
But there are a few cases where this isn&apos;t true: the urls
at the bottom of mails sent from free email services like
Yahoo Mail and Hotmail, for example.<br><br>To protect such sites, and to prevent abuse, auto-retrieval
should be combined with blacklists of spamvertised sites.
Only sites on a blacklist would get crawled, and
sites would be blacklisted
only after being inspected by humans. The lifetime of a spam
must be several hours at least, so
it should be easy to update such a list in time to
interfere with a spam promoting a new site. [2]<br><br>High-volume auto-retrieval would only be practical for users
on high-bandwidth
connections, but there are enough of those to cause spammers
serious trouble.   Indeed, this solution neatly
mirrors the problem.  The problem with spam is that in
order to reach a few gullible people the spammer sends 
mail to everyone.  The non-gullible recipients
are merely collateral damage.  But the non-gullible majority
won&apos;t stop getting spam until they can stop (or threaten to
stop) the gullible
from responding to it.  Auto-retrieving spam filters offer
them a way to do this.<br><br>Would that kill spam?  Not quite.  The biggest spammers
could probably protect their servers against auto-retrieving 
filters.  However, the easiest and cheapest way for them
to do it would be to include working unsubscribe links in   
their mails.  And this would be a necessity for smaller fry,
and for &quot;legitimate&quot; sites that hired spammers to promote
them.  So if auto-retrieving filters became widespread,
they&apos;d become auto-unsubscribing filters.<br><br>In this scenario, spam would, like OS crashes, viruses, and
popups, become one of those plagues that only afflict people
who don&apos;t bother to use the right software.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] Auto-retrieving filters will have to follow redirects,
and should in some cases (e.g. a page that just says
&quot;click here&quot;) follow more than one level of links.
Make sure too that
the http requests are indistinguishable from those of
popular Web browsers, including the order and referrer.<br><br>If the response
doesn&apos;t come back within x amount of time, default to
some fairly high spam probability.<br><br>Instead of making n constant, it might be a good idea to
make it a function of the number of spams that have been
seen mentioning the site.  This would add a further level of
protection against abuse and accidents.<br><br>[2] The original version of this article used the term
&quot;whitelist&quot; instead of &quot;blacklist&quot;.  Though they were
to work like blacklists, I preferred to call them whitelists
because it might make them less vulnerable to legal attack.
This just seems to have confused readers, though.<br><br>There should probably be multiple blacklists.  A single point
of failure would be vulnerable both to attack and abuse.<br><br><!--[6] I don't pretend to have worked out all the
<a href="ffbfaq.html">details</a> of this
scheme.  I can't claim to be certain it will work.  (Who
could till it has been tried in practice?)  Fortunately,
unlike solutions that require new protocols, this one can
be tested on a subset of the problem.  Why not try using   
FFBs on, say, domains that begin with A?
If spammers start to avoid such domains, we'll know we're winning,
and we can roll
down the rest of the alphabet one letter at a time.

Have you ever seen an old photo of yourself and
been embarrassed at the way you looked?   <i>Did we actually
dress like that?</i>  We did.  And we had no idea how
silly we looked.
It&apos;s the nature of fashion to be invisible, in the
same way the movement of the earth is invisible to all
of us riding on it.<br><br>What scares me is that there are moral fashions too.
They&apos;re just as arbitrary, and just as invisible to most people.
But they&apos;re much more dangerous.
Fashion is mistaken for good design; 
moral fashion is mistaken for good.
Dressing oddly gets you laughed at.  Violating
moral fashions can get you fired, ostracized, imprisoned, or
even killed.<br><br>If you could travel back in a time machine, one thing
would be true no matter where you went: you&apos;d have to watch
what you said.  
Opinions we consider harmless could have 
gotten you in big trouble.
I&apos;ve already said at least one thing that would have gotten me in big
trouble in most of Europe in the seventeenth century,
and did get Galileo in big trouble when he said
it&#x2014;that the earth moves. [1]<br><br><!--

They say improper things
for the same reason they dress unfashionably and have good ideas:
convention has less hold over them.
-->
It seems to be a constant throughout history: In every
period, people believed things that were just ridiculous,
and believed them so strongly that you would have gotten in
terrible trouble for saying otherwise.<br><br>Is our time any different?
To anyone who has read any amount of history, the answer is
almost certainly no.   It would be a remarkable coincidence if ours
were the first era to get everything just right.<br><br>It&apos;s tantalizing to think we believe
things that people in the future will find ridiculous.
What <i>would</i> someone coming back to visit us in a time machine
have to be careful not to say?
That&apos;s what I want to study here.
But
I want to do more than just shock everyone with
the heresy du jour.  I want to find general
recipes for discovering what you can&apos;t say, in any era.<br><br><b>The Conformist Test</b><br><br>Let&apos;s start with a test:  
Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express
in front of a group of your peers?<br><br>If the answer is no,
you might want to stop and think about that.  If everything
you believe is something you&apos;re supposed to believe, could
that possibly be a coincidence?  Odds are it isn&apos;t.  Odds are
you just think whatever you&apos;re told.<br><br>The other alternative would be that you independently considered
every question and came up with the exact same answers that
are now considered acceptable.  That seems unlikely, because
you&apos;d also have to make the same mistakes.  Mapmakers
deliberately put slight mistakes in their maps so they can
tell when someone copies them.  If another map has the same
mistake, that&apos;s very convincing evidence.<br><br>Like every other era in history, our moral map almost certainly
contains a few mistakes.  And anyone who makes the same mistakes
probably didn&apos;t do it by accident.  It would be
like someone claiming they had independently decided in
1972 that bell-bottom jeans were a good idea.<br><br>If you believe everything you&apos;re supposed to now, how can
you be sure you wouldn&apos;t also have believed everything you
were supposed to if you had grown up among the plantation
owners of the pre-Civil War South, or in Germany in the 1930s&#x2014;or
among the Mongols in 1200, for that matter?  Odds are you
would have.<br><br>Back in the era of terms like &quot;well-adjusted,&quot; the idea
seemed to be that there was something wrong with
you if you thought things you didn&apos;t dare say out loud.
This seems backward.  Almost certainly, there
is something wrong with you if you <i>don&apos;t</i> think things
you don&apos;t dare say out loud.<br><br><b>Trouble</b><br><br>What can&apos;t we say?  One way to find these ideas is simply to look
at things people do say, and get in trouble for.  [2]<br><br>Of course, we&apos;re not just looking for things we can&apos;t say.   
We&apos;re looking for things we can&apos;t say that are true, or at least
have enough chance of being true that the question
should remain open.  But many of the
things people get in trouble for saying probably
do make it over this second, lower threshold.  No one
gets in trouble for saying
that 2 + 2 is 5, or that people in Pittsburgh are ten feet tall.
Such obviously false statements might be treated as jokes, or
at worst as evidence of insanity, but they are not likely to
make anyone mad.  The statements that make people mad are
the ones they worry might be believed.
I suspect the statements that make people maddest
are those they worry might be true.<br><br>If Galileo had said that people in Padua were ten feet tall,
he would have been regarded as a harmless eccentric.  Saying   
the earth orbited the sun was another matter.  The church knew
this would set people thinking.<br><br>Certainly, as we look back on the past, this rule of thumb works
well.  A lot of the statements people got in trouble for seem
harmless now.  So it&apos;s likely that visitors from the
future would agree with at least some of the statements that
get people in trouble today.  Do we have no Galileos?  Not
likely.<br><br>To find them,
keep track of opinions that get
people in trouble, and start asking, could this be true?
Ok, it may be heretical (or whatever modern equivalent), but
might it also be true?<br><br><b>Heresy</b><br><br>This won&apos;t get us all the answers, though.  What if no one
happens to have gotten in trouble for a particular idea yet?
What if some idea would be so radioactively controversial that
no one would dare express it in public?   How can we find these too?<br><br>Another approach is to follow that word, heresy.  In every period
of history, there seem to have been labels that got applied to 
statements to shoot them down before anyone had a chance to ask
if they were true or not.  &quot;Blasphemy&quot;, &quot;sacrilege&quot;, and &quot;heresy&quot;
were such
labels for a good part of western history, as in more recent times
&quot;indecent&quot;, &quot;improper&quot;, and &quot;unamerican&quot; have been.   By now these
labels have lost their sting.  They always do.
By now they&apos;re mostly used ironically.
But in their time,
they had real force.<br><br>The word &quot;defeatist&quot;, for example, has no particular political
connotations now.
But in Germany in 1917 it was a weapon, used by Ludendorff in
a purge of those who favored a negotiated peace.
At the start of World War II it was used
extensively by Churchill and his supporters to silence their
opponents.
In 1940, any argument against Churchill&apos;s aggressive policy was &quot;defeatist&quot;.
Was it right or wrong?  Ideally, no one got far enough to ask
that.<br><br><!--
(I have this commented out while I investigate whether the current 
 fashion for the word "divisive" really began with the Republicans.
 So far it seems not.  Oops; sorry.<br><br>We have such labels today, of course, quite a lot of them.  
Many come from the left, including
the startlingly general "inappropriate", but the most recent comes
from the right: "divisive", which the current
administration uses to silence opponents on almost any topic.
-->
We have such labels today, of course, quite a lot of them,
from the all-purpose &quot;inappropriate&quot; to the dreaded &quot;divisive.&quot;
In any period, it should be easy to figure out what such labels are,
simply by looking at what people call ideas they disagree
with besides untrue.  When a politician says his opponent is
mistaken, that&apos;s a straightforward criticism, but when he
attacks a statement as &quot;divisive&quot; or &quot;racially insensitive&quot;
instead of arguing that it&apos;s false, we should start paying
attention.<br><br>So another way to figure out which of our taboos future generations
will laugh at is to start with the
labels.  Take a label&#x2014;&quot;sexist&quot;, for example&#x2014;and try to think
of some ideas that would be called that.  Then for each ask, might
this be true?<br><br>Just start listing ideas at random?  Yes, because they
won&apos;t really be random.  The ideas that come to mind first
will be the most plausible ones.  They&apos;ll be things you&apos;ve already  
noticed but didn&apos;t let yourself think.<br><br>In 1989 some clever researchers tracked
the eye movements of radiologists as they scanned chest images for
signs of lung cancer. [3]  They found that even when the radiologists
missed a cancerous lesion, their eyes had usually paused at the site of it.
Part of their brain knew there was something there; it just
didn&apos;t percolate all the way up into conscious knowledge. 
I think many interesting heretical thoughts are already mostly   
formed in our minds.  If we turn off our self-censorship
temporarily, those will be the first to emerge.<br><br><b>Time and Space</b><br><br>If we could look into the future it would be obvious which
of our taboos they&apos;d laugh at.
We can&apos;t do that, but we can do something almost as good: we can
look into the past.  Another way to figure out what we&apos;re
getting wrong is to look at what used to be acceptable
and is now unthinkable.<br><br>Changes between the past and the present sometimes do represent
progress.  In a field like physics,
if we disagree with past generations it&apos;s because we&apos;re
right and they&apos;re wrong.  But this becomes rapidly less true as   
you move away from the certainty of the hard sciences.  By the time
you get to social questions, many changes are just fashion.
The age of consent fluctuates like hemlines.<br><br>We may imagine that we are a great deal smarter and more virtuous than
past generations, but the more history you read, the less likely
this seems.  People in past times were much like us.  Not heroes,
not barbarians.  Whatever their ideas were, they were ideas
reasonable people could believe.<br><br>So here is another source of interesting heresies.  Diff present
ideas against those of various past cultures, and see what you   
get. [4]
Some will be
shocking by present standards.  Ok, fine; but which might also be true?<br><br>You don&apos;t have to look into the past to find big differences.   
In our own time, different societies have wildly varying ideas
of what&apos;s ok and what isn&apos;t.
So you can try diffing other cultures&apos; ideas against ours as well.
(The best way to do that is to visit them.)<br><br>You might find contradictory taboos.  In one
culture it might seem shocking to think x, while in another
it was shocking not to.  But 
I think usually the shock is on one side.  In one
culture x is ok, and in another it&apos;s considered shocking.  My
hypothesis is that the side
that&apos;s shocked is most likely to be the mistaken one.
[5]<br><br>I suspect the only taboos that are more than taboos
are the ones that are universal, or nearly so.  Murder for example.
But any idea that&apos;s considered harmless in a significant
percentage of times and places, and yet is taboo in ours,
is a good candidate for something we&apos;re mistaken
about.<br><br>For example, at the high water mark of political correctness
in the early 1990s, Harvard distributed to its
faculty and staff a brochure saying, among other things, that it
was inappropriate to compliment a colleague or student&apos;s
clothes.  No more &quot;nice shirt.&quot;
I think this principle is rare among the world&apos;s cultures, past or present.
There are probably more where it&apos;s considered especially
polite to compliment someone&apos;s clothing than where it&apos;s considered
improper.
So odds are this is, in a mild form, an example of one of
the taboos a visitor from the future would
have to be careful to avoid if he happened to set his time machine for
Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1992.<br><br><b>Prigs</b><br><br>Of course, if they have time machines in the future they&apos;ll
probably have a separate reference manual just for Cambridge.
This has always been a fussy place, a town of i dotters and
t crossers, where you&apos;re liable to get both your grammar and   
your ideas corrected in the same conversation.   And that
suggests another way to find taboos.  Look for prigs,
and see what&apos;s inside their heads.<br><br>Kids&apos; heads are repositories of all our taboos.
It seems fitting to us that kids&apos; ideas should be bright and clean.
The picture we give them of the world is 
not merely simplified, to suit their developing minds, 
but sanitized as well, to suit our
ideas of what kids ought to think. [6]<br><br>You can see this on a small scale in the matter of
dirty words.  A lot of my friends are starting to have children
now, and they&apos;re all trying 
not to use words like
&quot;fuck&quot; and &quot;shit&quot; within baby&apos;s hearing, lest baby start using 
these words too.
But these
words are part of the language, and adults use them all the
time.  So parents are giving their kids an inaccurate idea of 
the language by not using
them.  Why do they do this?  Because they don&apos;t think it&apos;s
fitting that kids should use the whole language.  We like
children to seem innocent. [7]<br><br>Most adults, likewise, deliberately give kids a misleading
view of the world.
One of the most obvious
examples is Santa Claus.  We think it&apos;s cute for little kids to
believe in Santa Claus.  I myself think it&apos;s cute for little
kids to believe in Santa Claus.  But one wonders, do we tell
them this stuff for their sake, or for ours?<br><br>I&apos;m not arguing for or against this idea here.  It is probably
inevitable that parents should want to dress up their kids&apos;
minds in cute little baby outfits.  I&apos;ll probably do it myself.
The important thing for our purposes is that, as a result,
a well brought-up teenage kid&apos;s brain is a more
or less complete collection of all our taboos&#x2014;and in mint
condition, because they&apos;re untainted by experience.  
Whatever we think that will later turn out to be ridiculous, 
it&apos;s almost certainly inside that head.<br><br>How do we get at these ideas?  By the following thought experiment.
Imagine a kind of latter-day Conrad character
who has worked for a time as a mercenary in Africa, for a time
as a doctor in Nepal, for a time as the manager of a
nightclub in Miami.  The specifics don&apos;t matter&#x2014;just
someone who has
seen a lot.  Now imagine comparing what&apos;s inside this guy&apos;s head
with what&apos;s inside the head
of a well-behaved sixteen year old girl from
the suburbs.  What does he think that
would shock her?
He knows the world; she knows, or at least embodies, present
taboos.  Subtract one from the other, and the result is what
we can&apos;t say.
<!-- bowles quote about dentist's son from long island--><br><br><b>Mechanism</b><br><br>I can think of one more way to figure out what we can&apos;t
say: to look at how taboos are created.   How do moral
fashions arise, and why are they adopted?
If we can understand this mechanism, we
may be able to see it at work in our own time.<br><br>Moral fashions don&apos;t seem to be created the way ordinary
fashions are.  Ordinary fashions seem to arise by accident when
everyone imitates the whim of some influential person.
The fashion for broad-toed shoes in
late fifteenth century Europe began because Charles VIII of
France had six toes on one foot.  The fashion for the
name Gary began when the actor Frank Cooper adopted the name
of a tough mill town in Indiana.  Moral fashions more often
seem to be created deliberately.  When there&apos;s something we
can&apos;t say, it&apos;s often because some group doesn&apos;t want us to.<br><br>The prohibition will be strongest when the group is nervous. 
The irony of Galileo&apos;s situation was that he got in trouble
for repeating Copernicus&apos;s ideas.  Copernicus himself didn&apos;t.
In fact, Copernicus was a canon of a cathedral, and dedicated his
book to the pope.  But by Galileo&apos;s time the church was in
the throes of the Counter-Reformation and was much more
worried about unorthodox ideas.<br><br>To launch a taboo, a group has to be poised halfway between
weakness and power.  A confident group doesn&apos;t need taboos
to protect it.  It&apos;s not considered improper to
make disparaging remarks about Americans, or the English.
And yet a group has to be powerful enough to enforce a
taboo.  Coprophiles, as of this writing, don&apos;t seem to be
numerous or energetic enough to have had their
interests promoted to a lifestyle.<br><br>I suspect the biggest source of moral taboos will turn out to
be power struggles in which one side only barely has
the upper hand.  That&apos;s where you&apos;ll find a group
powerful enough to enforce taboos, but weak enough to need them.<br><br>Most struggles, whatever they&apos;re really about, will be cast
as struggles between competing ideas.
The English Reformation was at bottom a struggle for wealth and power,
but it ended up being
cast as a struggle to preserve the souls
of Englishmen from the corrupting influence of Rome.
It&apos;s easier to get people to fight for an idea.
And whichever side wins, their
ideas will also be considered to have triumphed, as if God
wanted to signal his agreement by selecting that side as the victor.<br><br>We often like to think of World War II as a triumph
of freedom over totalitarianism.  We conveniently forget that
the Soviet Union was also one of the winners.<br><br>I&apos;m not saying that struggles are never about ideas,
just that they will always be made to seem to be about
ideas, whether they are or not.   And just as there is nothing
so unfashionable as the last, discarded fashion, there is
nothing so wrong as the principles of the most recently
defeated opponent.
<!-- The ideas of the losers in the last war will always trade
at a discount. -->
Representational art is only now
recovering from the approval of both Hitler and Stalin. [8]<br><br>Although moral fashions tend to arise from different sources
than fashions in clothing, the mechanism of their adoption seems
much the same.  The early adopters will be driven by ambition:
self-consciously cool people who want to distinguish themselves
from the common herd.  As the fashion becomes established they&apos;ll
be joined by a second, much larger group, driven by fear. [9] This
second group adopt the fashion not because they want to stand
out but because they are afraid of standing out.<br><br>So if you want to figure out what we can&apos;t say, look at the
machinery of fashion and try to predict what it would make
unsayable.  What groups are powerful but nervous, and what
ideas would they like to suppress?  What ideas were tarnished by
association when they ended up on the losing side of a recent
struggle?  If a self-consciously cool person wanted to differentiate
himself from preceding fashions (e.g. from his parents), 
which of their ideas would he tend to reject?
What are conventional-minded people afraid of saying?<br><br>This technique won&apos;t find us all the things we can&apos;t say.
I can think of some that aren&apos;t the result of
any recent struggle. Many of our taboos are rooted
deep in the past.  But this approach, combined with the
preceding four, will turn up a good number of unthinkable
ideas.<br><br><b>Why</b><br><br>Some would ask, why would one want to do this?  Why deliberately
go poking around among nasty, disreputable ideas?  Why look 
under rocks?<br><br>I do it, first of all, for the same reason I did look under
rocks as a kid: plain curiosity.  And I&apos;m especially curious about
anything that&apos;s forbidden.  Let me see and decide for myself.<br><br>Second, I do it because I don&apos;t like the idea of being mistaken.
If, like other eras, we believe things that will later seem ridiculous,
I want to know what they are so that I, at least, can avoid
believing them.<br><br>Third, I do it because it&apos;s good for the brain.  To do good work
you need a brain that can go anywhere.  And you especially need a
brain that&apos;s in the habit of going where it&apos;s not supposed to.<br><br>Great work tends to grow out of ideas
that others have overlooked, and no idea is so overlooked as one that&apos;s
unthinkable.
Natural selection, for example.
It&apos;s so simple.  Why didn&apos;t anyone think of it before?  Well,
that is all too obvious.  Darwin himself was careful to tiptoe
around the implications of his theory.  He wanted to spend his
time thinking about biology, not arguing with people who accused
him of being an atheist.<br><br>In the sciences, especially, it&apos;s a great advantage to be able to
question assumptions.
The m.o. of scientists, or at least of the
good ones, is precisely that: look for places where
conventional wisdom is broken, and then try to pry apart the
cracks and see what&apos;s underneath.  That&apos;s where new theories come
from.<br><br>A good scientist, in other words, does not merely ignore
conventional wisdom, but makes a special effort to break it.
Scientists go looking for trouble.
This should be the m.o. of any scholar, but 
scientists seem much more willing to look under rocks. [10]<br><br>Why?  It could
be that the scientists are simply smarter; most physicists could,
if necessary, make it through a PhD program in French literature,
but few professors of French literature could make it through
a PhD program in physics.  Or it could be because it&apos;s clearer
in the sciences whether theories are true or false, and this
makes scientists bolder.  (Or it could be that, because it&apos;s
clearer in the sciences whether theories are true or false, you
have to be smart to get jobs as a scientist, rather than just a
good politician.)<br><br>Whatever the reason, there seems a clear correlation between
intelligence and willingness to consider shocking ideas.
This isn&apos;t just because smart people actively work to find holes in
conventional thinking.  I think conventions also have
less hold over them to start with.
You can see that in the
way they dress.<br><br>It&apos;s not only in the sciences that heresy pays off.
In any competitive field, you can
<a href="avg.html">win big</a> by seeing things that others daren&apos;t.  
And in every
field there are probably heresies few dare utter.  Within
the US car industry there is a lot of hand-wringing now
about declining market share.
Yet the cause is so obvious that any observant outsider could
explain it in a second: they make bad cars.  And they have for
so long that by now the US car brands are antibrands&#x2014;something
you&apos;d buy a car despite, not because of.  Cadillac stopped
being the Cadillac of cars in about 1970.  And yet I suspect
no one dares say this. [11]  Otherwise these companies would have
tried to fix the problem.<br><br>Training yourself to think unthinkable thoughts has advantages
beyond the thoughts themselves.  It&apos;s like stretching.
When you stretch before running, you put your body into positions
much more extreme
than any it will assume during the run.
If you can think things
so outside the box that they&apos;d make people&apos;s hair stand on end,
you&apos;ll have no trouble with the small trips outside the box that
people call innovative.<br><br><b><i>Pensieri Stretti</i></b><br><br>When you find something you can&apos;t say, what do you do with it?
My advice is, don&apos;t say it.   Or at least, pick your battles.<br><br>Suppose in the future there is a movement to ban
the color yellow. Proposals to paint anything yellow are
denounced as &quot;yellowist&quot;, as is anyone suspected of liking the

wrong with yellow.  If you go around saying this, you&apos;ll be
denounced as a yellowist too, and you&apos;ll find yourself having a   
lot of arguments with anti-yellowists.

say everything you think, it may inhibit you from thinking  
improper thoughts.  I think it&apos;s better to follow the opposite
policy.  Draw a sharp line between your thoughts and your
speech.  Inside your head, anything is allowed.
Within my head I make a point of encouraging the most outrageous
thoughts I can imagine. 
But, as in
a secret society, nothing that happens within the building
should be told to outsiders.  The first rule of Fight
Club is, you do not talk about Fight Club.<br><br>When Milton was going to visit Italy in the 1630s,
Sir Henry Wootton, who had been ambassador to Venice, told him
his motto should be
<i>&quot;i pensieri stretti &amp; il viso sciolto.&quot;</i>  Closed thoughts
and an open face.  Smile at everyone, and don&apos;t tell them
what you&apos;re thinking.   This was wise advice.
Milton was an argumentative fellow, and the Inquisition
was a bit restive at that time.  But I think the difference 
between Milton&apos;s situation and ours is only a matter of
degree.
Every era has its heresies, and if you don&apos;t get imprisoned for them you
will at least get in enough trouble that it becomes a complete
distraction.<br><br>I admit it seems cowardly to keep quiet.
When I read about the harassment to which
the Scientologists subject their critics [12], or that pro-Israel groups
are &quot;compiling dossiers&quot; on those who speak out against Israeli
human rights abuses [13], or about people being sued for
violating the DMCA [14], part of me wants
to say, &quot;All right, you bastards, bring it on.&quot;
The problem is, there are so many things you can&apos;t say.
If you said them all you&apos;d 
have no time left for your real work.
You&apos;d have to turn into Noam Chomsky.  [15]<br><br>The trouble with keeping your thoughts secret, though,
is that you lose the advantages of discussion.  Talking
about an idea leads to more ideas.
So the optimal plan, if you can manage it,
is to have a few trusted
friends you can speak openly to.  This is not just a
way to develop ideas; it&apos;s also a good
rule of thumb for choosing friends.  The people
you can say heretical things to without getting jumped on
are also the most interesting to know.<br><br><b><i>Viso Sciolto?</i></b><br><br>I don&apos;t think we need
the <i>viso sciolto</i> so much as the <i>pensieri stretti.</i>
Perhaps the best policy is to make it plain that you don&apos;t
agree with whatever zealotry is current in your time, but
not to be too specific about what you disagree with.  Zealots
will try to draw you out, but you don&apos;t have to answer them.
If they try to force you to treat a question on their
terms by asking &quot;are you with us or against us?&quot; you can
always just answer &quot;neither&quot;.<br><br>Better still, answer &quot;I haven&apos;t decided.&quot;
That&apos;s what Larry Summers
did when a group tried to put
him in this position.  Explaining himself later, he said
&quot;I don&apos;t do litmus tests.&quot; [16]
A lot of the
questions people get hot about are actually quite complicated.
There is no prize for getting the answer quickly.<br><br>If the anti-yellowists seem to be getting out of hand and
you want to fight back, there are ways
to do it without getting yourself accused of being a
yellowist.  Like skirmishers in
an ancient army, you want to avoid directly engaging the
main body of the enemy&apos;s troops.  Better to harass them
with arrows from a distance.<br><br>One way to do this is to ratchet the debate up one level of
abstraction.
If you argue against censorship in general, you can avoid being
accused of whatever heresy is contained
in the book or film that someone is trying to censor.
You can attack labels with meta-labels: labels that refer
to the use of labels to prevent discussion.
The spread of the term &quot;political correctness&quot; meant the beginning of
the end of political correctness, because it enabled one to
attack the phenomenon as a whole without being accused of any
of the specific heresies it sought to suppress.<br><br>Another way to counterattack is with metaphor.  Arthur Miller
undermined the House Un-American Activities Committee
by writing a play, &quot;The Crucible,&quot; about the Salem witch trials.
He never referred directly to the committee and so gave them
no way to reply.
What could HUAC do, defend the Salem witch trials?  And yet
Miller&apos;s metaphor stuck so well that to this day the activities
of the committee are often described as a &quot;witch-hunt.&quot;<br><br>Best of all, probably, is humor.  Zealots, whatever their   
cause, invariably lack a sense of humor.
They can&apos;t reply in kind to jokes.
They&apos;re as unhappy on the territory of
humor as a mounted knight on a skating rink.
Victorian prudishness, for example, seems to have been defeated
mainly by treating it as a joke.  Likewise its reincarnation as
political correctness.
&quot;I am glad that I
managed to write &apos;The Crucible,&apos;&quot; Arthur Miller wrote,
&quot;but looking back I have often wished I&apos;d
had the temperament to do an absurd comedy, which is what the
situation deserved.&quot; [17]<br><br><b>ABQ</b><br><br>A Dutch friend says
I should use Holland as an example of a tolerant society.
It&apos;s true they have a long tradition of
comparative open-mindedness.  For centuries the low countries were the place
to go to say things you couldn&apos;t say anywhere else,
and this helped to make the region a center of scholarship and industry
(which have been closely tied for longer than most people realize).
Descartes, though claimed by the French, did much of his thinking in
Holland.<br><br>And yet, I wonder.  The Dutch seem to live their lives up to their
necks in rules and regulations.  There&apos;s so much you can&apos;t do there;
is there really nothing
you can&apos;t say?<br><br>Certainly the fact that they value open-mindedness is no guarantee.
Who thinks they&apos;re not open-minded?  Our hypothetical prim miss from
the suburbs thinks she&apos;s open-minded.  Hasn&apos;t she been
taught to be?  Ask anyone, and they&apos;ll say the same thing: they&apos;re
pretty open-minded, though they draw the line at things that are really
wrong.  (Some tribes
may avoid &quot;wrong&quot; as
judgemental, and may instead use a more neutral sounding euphemism
like &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;destructive&quot;.)<br><br>When people are bad at math, they know it, because they get the
wrong answers on tests.  But when people are bad at open-mindedness
they don&apos;t know it.  In fact they tend to think the opposite.
Remember, it&apos;s the nature of fashion to be invisible.  It wouldn&apos;t
work otherwise.  Fashion doesn&apos;t
seem like fashion to someone in the grip of it.  It just seems like
the right thing to do.  It&apos;s only by looking from a distance that
we see oscillations in people&apos;s idea of the right thing to do, and
can identify them as fashions.<br><br>Time gives us such distance for free.  Indeed, the arrival of new
fashions makes old fashions easy to see, because they
seem so ridiculous by contrast.  From one end of a pendulum&apos;s
swing, the other end seems especially far away.<br><br>To see fashion in your own time, though, requires a conscious effort.
Without time to give you distance, you have to create distance yourself.
Instead of being part of the mob, stand
as far away from it as you can and watch what it&apos;s
doing.  And pay especially close attention whenever an idea is being
suppressed.  Web filters for children and employees often ban
sites containing pornography, violence, and hate speech.  What
counts as pornography and violence?  And what, exactly, is
&quot;hate speech?&quot; This sounds like a phrase out of <i>1984.</i><br><br>Labels like that are probably the biggest external clue.
If a statement is false,
that&apos;s the worst thing you can say about it.  You don&apos;t
need to say that it&apos;s heretical.  And if it isn&apos;t false, it
shouldn&apos;t be suppressed.  So when you see statements being
attacked as x-ist or y-ic (substitute your current values of
x and y), whether in 1630 or 2030, that&apos;s a sure sign that
something is wrong.  When you hear such labels being used,
ask why.<br><br>Especially if you hear yourself using them.  It&apos;s not just
the mob you need to learn to watch from a distance.  You need to be
able to watch your own thoughts from a distance.  That&apos;s not
a radical idea, by the way; it&apos;s the main difference between
children and adults.  When a child gets angry because he&apos;s
tired, he doesn&apos;t know what&apos;s happening.  An adult can
distance himself enough from the
situation to say &quot;never mind, I&apos;m just tired.&quot;  I don&apos;t
see why one couldn&apos;t, by a similar process, learn to
recognize and discount the effects of moral fashions.<br><br>You have to take that extra step if you want to think clearly.
But it&apos;s harder, because now you&apos;re working against social customs 
instead of with them.  Everyone encourages you to grow up to the 
point where you can discount your own bad moods.  Few encourage   
you to continue to the point where you can discount society&apos;s bad
moods.<br><br>How can you see the wave, when you&apos;re the water?  Always be
questioning.  That&apos;s the only defence.  What can&apos;t you say?  And why?<br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/saynotes.html"><b>Notes</b></a><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sarah Harlin, Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston,

size="2" face="verdana">April 2004<br><br>To the popular press, &quot;hacker&quot; means someone who breaks
into computers.  Among programmers it means a good programmer.
But the two meanings are connected.  To programmers,
&quot;hacker&quot; connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone
who can make a computer do what he wants&#x2014;whether the computer
wants to or not.<br><br>To add to the confusion, the noun &quot;hack&quot; also has two senses.  It can
be either a compliment or an insult.  It&apos;s called a hack when
you do something in an ugly way.  But when you do something
so clever that you somehow beat the system, that&apos;s also
called a hack.  The word is used more often in the former than
the latter sense, probably because ugly solutions are more
common than brilliant ones.<br><br>Believe it or not, the two senses of &quot;hack&quot; are also
connected.  Ugly and imaginative solutions have something in
common: they both break the rules.  And there is a gradual
continuum between rule breaking that&apos;s merely ugly (using
duct tape to attach something to your bike) and rule breaking
that is brilliantly imaginative (discarding Euclidean space).<br><br>Hacking predates computers.  When he
was working on the Manhattan Project, Richard Feynman used to
amuse himself by breaking into safes containing secret documents.
This tradition continues today.
When we were in grad school, a hacker friend of mine who spent too much
time around MIT had
his own lock picking kit.
(He now runs a hedge fund, a not unrelated enterprise.)<br><br>It is sometimes hard to explain to authorities why one would
want to do such things.
Another friend of mine once got in trouble with the government for
breaking into computers.  This had only recently been declared
a crime, and the FBI found that their usual investigative
technique didn&apos;t work.  Police investigation apparently begins with
a motive.  The usual motives are few: drugs, money, sex,
revenge.  Intellectual curiosity was not one of the motives on
the FBI&apos;s list.  Indeed, the whole concept seemed foreign to
them.<br><br>Those in authority tend to be annoyed by hackers&apos;
general attitude of disobedience.  But that disobedience is
a byproduct of the qualities that make them good programmers.
They may laugh at the CEO when he talks in generic corporate
newspeech, but they also laugh at someone who tells them
a certain problem can&apos;t be solved.
Suppress one, and you suppress the other.<br><br>This attitude is sometimes affected.  Sometimes young programmers
notice the eccentricities of eminent hackers and decide to
adopt some of their own in order to seem smarter.
The fake version is not merely
annoying; the prickly attitude of these posers
can actually slow the process of innovation.<br><br>But even factoring in their annoying eccentricities,
the disobedient attitude of hackers is a net win.  I wish its
advantages were better understood.<br><br>For example, I suspect people in Hollywood are
simply mystified by
hackers&apos; attitudes toward copyrights.  They are a perennial
topic of heated discussion on Slashdot.
But why should people who program computers
be so concerned about copyrights, of all things?<br><br>Partly because some companies use <i>mechanisms</i> to prevent
copying.  Show any hacker a lock and his first thought is
how to pick it.  But there is a deeper reason that
hackers are alarmed by measures like copyrights and patents.
They see increasingly aggressive measures to protect
&quot;intellectual property&quot;
as a threat to the intellectual
freedom they need to do their job.
And they are right.<br><br>It is by poking about inside current technology that
hackers get ideas for the next generation.  No thanks,
intellectual homeowners may say, we don&apos;t need any
outside help.  But they&apos;re wrong.
The next generation of computer technology has
often&#x2014;perhaps more often than not&#x2014;been developed by outsiders.<br><br>In 1977 there was no doubt some group within IBM developing
what they expected to be
the next generation of business computer.  They were mistaken.
The next generation of business computer was
being developed on entirely different lines by two long-haired
guys called Steve in a <a href="garage.html">garage</a> in Los Altos.  At about the
same time, the powers that be
were cooperating to develop the
official next generation operating system, Multics.
But two guys who thought Multics excessively complex went off
and wrote their own.  They gave it a name that
was a joking reference to Multics: Unix.<br><br>The latest intellectual property laws impose
unprecedented restrictions on the sort of poking around that
leads to new ideas. In the past, a competitor might use patents
to prevent you from selling a copy of something they
made, but they couldn&apos;t prevent you from
taking one apart to see how it worked.   The latest
laws make this a crime.  How are we
to develop new technology if we can&apos;t study current
technology to figure out how to improve it?<br><br>Ironically, hackers have brought this on themselves.
Computers are responsible for the problem.  The control systems
inside machines used to be physical: gears and levers and cams.
Increasingly, the brains (and thus the value) of products is
in software. And by this I mean software in the general sense:
i.e. data.  A song on an LP is physically stamped into the
plastic.  A song on an iPod&apos;s disk is merely stored on it.<br><br>Data is by definition easy to copy.  And the Internet
makes copies easy to distribute.  So it is no wonder
companies are afraid.  But, as so often happens, fear has
clouded their judgement.  The government has responded
with draconian laws to protect intellectual property.
They probably mean well. But
they may not realize that such laws will do more harm
than good.<br><br>Why are programmers so violently opposed to these laws?
If I were a legislator, I&apos;d be interested in this
mystery&#x2014;for the same reason that, if I were a farmer and suddenly
heard a lot of squawking coming from my hen house one night,
I&apos;d want to go out and investigate.  Hackers are not stupid,
and unanimity is very rare in this world.
So if they&apos;re all squawking,   
perhaps there is something amiss.<br><br>Could it be that such laws, though intended to protect America,
will actually harm it?  Think about it.  There is something
very <i>American</i> about Feynman breaking into safes during
the Manhattan Project.  It&apos;s hard to imagine the authorities
having a sense of humor about such things over
in Germany at that time.  Maybe it&apos;s not a coincidence.<br><br>Hackers are unruly.  That is the essence of hacking.  And it
is also the essence of Americanness.  It is no accident
that Silicon Valley
is in America, and not France, or Germany,
or England, or Japan. In those countries, people color inside
the lines.<br><br>I lived for a while in Florence.  But after I&apos;d been there
a few months I realized that what I&apos;d been unconsciously hoping
to find there was back in the place I&apos;d just left.
The reason Florence is famous is that in 1450, it was New York.
In 1450 it was filled with the kind of turbulent and ambitious
people you find now in America.  (So I went back to America.)<br><br>It is greatly to America&apos;s advantage that it is
a congenial atmosphere for the right sort of unruliness&#x2014;that
it is a home not just for the smart, but for smart-alecks.
And hackers are invariably smart-alecks.  If we had a national
holiday, it would be April 1st.  It says a great deal about
our work that we use the same word for a brilliant or a
horribly cheesy solution.   When we cook one up we&apos;re not
always 100% sure which kind it is.  But as long as it has
the right sort of wrongness, that&apos;s a promising sign.
It&apos;s odd that people
think of programming as precise and methodical.  <i>Computers</i>
are precise and methodical.  Hacking is something you do
with a gleeful laugh.<br><br>In our world some of the most characteristic solutions
are not far removed from practical
jokes.  IBM was no doubt rather surprised by the consequences
of the licensing deal for DOS, just as the hypothetical
&quot;adversary&quot; must be when Michael Rabin solves a problem by
redefining it as one that&apos;s easier to solve.<br><br>Smart-alecks have to develop a keen sense of how much they
can <a href="say.html">get away</a> with.  And lately hackers 
have sensed a change
in the atmosphere.
Lately hackerliness seems rather frowned upon.<br><br>To hackers the recent contraction in civil liberties seems
especially ominous.  That must also mystify outsiders. 
Why should we care especially about civil
liberties?  Why programmers, more than
dentists or salesmen or landscapers?<br><br>Let me put the case in terms a government official would appreciate.
Civil liberties are not just an ornament, or a quaint
American tradition.  Civil liberties make countries rich.
If you made a graph of
GNP per capita vs. civil liberties, you&apos;d notice a definite
trend.  Could civil liberties really be a cause, rather
than just an effect?  I think so.  I think a society in which
people can do and say what they want will also tend to
be one in which the most efficient solutions win, rather than
those sponsored by the most influential people.
Authoritarian countries become corrupt;
corrupt countries become poor; and poor countries are weak. 
It seems to me there is
a Laffer curve for government power, just as for
tax revenues.  At least, it seems likely enough that it
would be stupid to try the experiment and find out.  Unlike
high tax rates, you can&apos;t repeal totalitarianism if it
turns out to be a mistake.<br><br>This is why hackers worry.  The government spying on people doesn&apos;t
literally make programmers write worse code.  It just leads
eventually to a world in which bad ideas win.  And because
this is so important to hackers, they&apos;re especially sensitive
to it.  They can sense totalitarianism approaching from a
distance, as animals can sense an approaching  
thunderstorm.<br><br>It would be ironic if, as hackers fear, recent measures
intended to protect national security and intellectual property
turned out to be a missile aimed right at what makes   
America successful.  But it would not be the first time that
measures taken in an atmosphere of panic had
the opposite of the intended effect.<br><br>There is such a thing as Americanness.
There&apos;s nothing like living abroad to teach you that.   
And if you want to know whether something will nurture or squash
this quality, it would be hard to find a better focus
group than hackers, because they come closest of any group
I know to embodying it.  Closer, probably,  than
the men running our government,
who for all their talk of patriotism
remind me more of Richelieu or Mazarin
than Thomas Jefferson or George Washington.<br><br>When you read what the founding fathers had to say for
themselves, they sound more like hackers.
&quot;The spirit of resistance to government,&quot;
Jefferson wrote, &quot;is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wish
it always to be kept alive.&quot;<br><br>Imagine an American president saying that today.
Like the remarks of an outspoken old grandmother, the sayings of
the founding fathers have embarrassed generations of
their less confident successors.  They remind us where we come from.
They remind us that it is the people who break rules that are
the source of America&apos;s wealth and power.<br><br>Those in a position to impose rules naturally want them to be
obeyed.  But be careful what you ask for. You might get it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Ken Anderson, Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Giffin,

(This essay was originally published in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596006624/104-0572701-7443937">Hackers 
&amp; Painters</a>.)
</i><br><br>If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best
bet would be to start or join a startup.  That&apos;s been a 
reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years.  The word &quot;startup&quot; 
dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is 
very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the
Middle Ages.<br><br>Startups usually involve technology, so much so that the phrase
&quot;high-tech startup&quot; is almost redundant.  A startup is a small
company that takes on a hard technical problem.<br><br>Lots of people get rich knowing nothing more than that.
You don&apos;t have to know physics to be a good pitcher.  But
I think it could give you an edge to understand the underlying principles.
Why do startups have to be small?  
Will a startup inevitably stop being a startup as it
grows larger?  
And why do they so often work on
developing new technology?   Why are there so many startups
selling new drugs or computer software, and none selling corn oil
or laundry detergent?<br><br><b>The Proposition</b><br><br>Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to 
compress your whole working life into a few years.  Instead
of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as
hard as you possibly can for four.  This pays especially well
in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.<br><br>Here is a brief sketch of the economic proposition.  If you&apos;re
a good hacker in your mid twenties, you can
get a job paying about $80,000 per year.  So on average 
such a hacker must be
able to do at least $80,000 worth of work per year for the 
company just to break even.  You could probably
work twice as many hours as a corporate employee, and if
you focus you can probably get three times as much done in
an hour. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font>
You should get another multiple of two, at
least, by eliminating the drag 
of the pointy-haired middle
manager who would be your boss in a big company.
Then there is one more multiple: how much smarter are you
than your job description expects you to be?
Suppose another multiple of three.  Combine all these multipliers, and I&apos;m
claiming you could be 36 times more 
productive than you&apos;re expected to be in a random corporate
job. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>
  If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a 
big company, then a smart
hacker working very hard without any corporate
bullshit to slow him down should be able to do work worth about
$3 million a year.<br><br>Like all back-of-the-envelope calculations, this one
has a lot of wiggle room.  I wouldn&apos;t try to
defend the actual numbers.  But I stand by the 
structure of the calculation.  I&apos;m not claiming
the multiplier is precisely 36, but it is certainly more
than 10, and probably rarely as high as 100.<br><br>If $3 million a year seems
high, remember that we&apos;re talking about the limit case:
the case where you not only have zero leisure time
but indeed work so hard that you endanger your health.<br><br>Startups are not magic.  They don&apos;t change the laws of
wealth creation.  They just represent a point at the far end of the curve.
There is a conservation law at work here: if
you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a 
million dollars&apos; worth of pain.  
For example, one way to
make a million dollars would be to work for the 
Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your 
salary.  Imagine the stress of working for the Post 
Office for fifty years.   In a startup you compress all
this stress into three or four years.  You do tend to get a 
certain 
bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain,
but you can&apos;t evade the fundamental conservation law.
If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it.<br><br><b>Millions, not Billions</b><br><br>If $3 million a year seems high to some people, it will seem
low to others.  Three <i>million?</i> 
How do I get to be a billionaire, like Bill Gates?<br><br>So let&apos;s get Bill Gates out of the way right now.  It&apos;s not
a good idea to use famous rich people 
as examples, because the press only 
write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers.
Bill Gates is a smart, determined, and hardworking man,
but you need more than
that to make as much money as he has.  You also need to be
very lucky.<br><br>There is a large random
factor in the success of any company.  So the guys you end 
up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very 
smart, totally dedicated, <i>and</i> win the lottery.
Certainly Bill is smart and dedicated, but Microsoft also 
happens to have been the beneficiary of one of the most spectacular
blunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for
DOS.  No doubt Bill did 
everything he could to steer IBM into making that blunder, 
and he has done an excellent job of exploiting it, but if
there had been one person with a brain on IBM&apos;s side,
Microsoft&apos;s future would have been very different.
Microsoft at that stage had little leverage over IBM.
They were effectively a component supplier.  If IBM had 
required an exclusive license, as they should have, Microsoft
would still have signed the deal.  It would still have
meant a lot of money for them,  and IBM
could easily have gotten an operating system elsewhere.<br><br>Instead IBM ended up using all its power in the market
to give Microsoft control of the PC standard.  From 
that point, all Microsoft had to do was execute.  They
never had to bet the company on a bold decision.  All they
had to do was play hardball with licensees and copy more
innovative products reasonably promptly.<br><br>If IBM hadn&apos;t made this mistake, Microsoft would
still have been a successful company, but it
could not have grown so big so fast. 
Bill Gates would be rich, but he&apos;d be somewhere
near the bottom of the Forbes 400 with the other guys his age.<br><br>There are a lot of ways to get
rich, and this essay is about only one of them.  This
essay is about how to make money by creating wealth and
getting paid for it.  There are plenty of other ways to 
get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance, 
theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly,
graft, lobbying,
counterfeiting, and prospecting.  Most of the greatest fortunes
have probably involved several of these.<br><br>The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich,
is not just that it&apos;s more legitimate 
(many of the other methods are now illegal) 
but that it&apos;s more
<i>straightforward.</i>  You just have to do something people want.<br><br><b>Money Is Not Wealth</b><br><br>If you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is.  
Wealth is not the same thing as money. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
  Wealth is as old as
human history.  Far older, in fact; ants have wealth. 
Money is a comparatively recent invention.<br><br>Wealth is the fundamental thing.  Wealth is stuff we want: food, 
clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places,
and so on.  You can have wealth without
having money.  If you had a magic machine that
could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your
laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn&apos;t need money.
Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is
nothing to buy, it wouldn&apos;t matter how much money you had.<br><br>Wealth is what you want, not money.  But if wealth is the important
thing, why does everyone talk about making money?   It is
a kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving wealth, and in practice
they are usually interchangeable.  But they are not the same thing,
and unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting, talking about
<i>making money</i> can make it harder to understand how to 
make money.<br><br>Money is a side effect of specialization.
In a specialized society, most of the
things you need, you can&apos;t make for yourself.  If you want a potato
or a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someone
else.<br><br>How do you get the person who grows the potatoes to give you some?
By giving him something he wants in return.  But you can&apos;t get
very far by trading things directly with the people who
need them.  If you make violins, and none of the local
farmers wants one, how will you eat?<br><br>The solution societies find, as they get more specialized, is to
make the trade into a two-step process.  Instead of trading violins
directly for potatoes, you trade violins for, say, silver, 
which you can then trade again for anything else you need.  The
intermediate stuff-- the <i>medium of exchange</i>-- can be anything that&apos;s
rare and portable.  Historically metals have been the most common,
but recently we&apos;ve been using a medium of exchange, called the <i>dollar</i>,
that doesn&apos;t physically exist.  It works as a medium of exchange,
however, because its rarity 
is guaranteed by the U.S. Government.<br><br>The advantage of a medium of exchange is that it makes trade work.
The disadvantage is that it tends to obscure what trade really
means.  People think that what a business does is make money.
But money is just the intermediate stage-- just
a shorthand-- for whatever people want.
What most businesses really do is make  
wealth.  They do something people want. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>The Pie Fallacy</b><br><br>A surprising number of people retain from childhood the idea
that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world. 
There is, in any normal family, a fixed amount of <i>money</i> at 
any moment.  But that&apos;s not the same thing.<br><br>When wealth is talked about in this context, it is often
described as a pie.  &quot;You can&apos;t make the pie larger,&quot;
say politicians.
When you&apos;re
talking about the amount of money in one family&apos;s bank
account, or the amount available to a government from one
year&apos;s tax revenue, this is true.  
If one person gets more, someone else has to get less.<br><br>I can remember believing, as a child, that if a few
rich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else.
Many people seem to continue to believe something like this
well into adulthood.  This fallacy is usually there in the 
background when you hear someone talking about how x percent
of the population have y percent of the wealth.  If you plan
to start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you&apos;re
planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.<br><br>What leads people astray here is the abstraction of
money.  Money is not wealth.  It&apos;s
just something we use to move wealth around.
So although there may be, in certain specific moments (like
your family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to
trade with other people for things you want,
there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world.  
<i>You can make more wealth.</i>  Wealth has been getting created and
destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.<br><br>Suppose you own a beat-up old car. 
Instead of sitting on your butt next
summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition.
In doing so you create wealth.  The world is-- and
you specifically are-- one pristine old car the richer.  And not
just in some metaphorical way.  If you sell your car,
you&apos;ll get more for it.<br><br>In restoring your old car you have made yourself
richer.  You haven&apos;t made anyone else poorer.  So there is
obviously not a fixed pie.  And in fact, when you look at 
it this way, you wonder why anyone would think there was. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Kids know, without knowing they know, that they can create
wealth.  If you need to give someone a present and don&apos;t
have any money, you make one.  But kids are so bad at making
things that they consider home-made presents to be a distinct,
inferior, sort of thing to store-bought ones-- a mere expression
of the proverbial thought that counts. 
And indeed, the lumpy ashtrays
we made for our parents did not have much of a resale market.<br><br><b>Craftsmen</b><br><br>The people most likely to grasp that wealth can be
created are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen.
Their hand-made objects become store-bought ones. 
But with the rise of industrialization there are fewer and
fewer craftsmen.  One of the biggest remaining groups  is
computer programmers.<br><br>A programmer can sit down in front of a computer and
<i>create wealth</i>.  A good piece of software is, in itself, 
a valuable thing.
There is no manufacturing to confuse the issue.  Those
characters you type 
are a complete, finished product.
If someone sat down and wrote a web
browser that didn&apos;t suck (a fine idea, by the way), the world
would be that much richer.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5bn"><font color="#777777">5b</font></a>]</font><br><br>Everyone in a company works together to create
wealth, in the sense of making more things people want.
Many of the employees (e.g. the people in the mailroom or
the personnel department) work at one remove from the 
actual making of stuff.  Not the programmers.  They
literally think the product, one line at a time.
And so it&apos;s clearer to programmers that wealth is something
that&apos;s made, rather than being distributed, like slices of a
pie, by some imaginary Daddy.<br><br>It&apos;s also obvious to programmers that there are huge variations
in the rate at which wealth is created.  At Viaweb we had one
programmer who was a sort of monster of productivity.  
I remember watching what he did one long day and estimating that
he had added several hundred thousand dollars
to the market value of the company. 
A great programmer, on a roll, could 
create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks.
A mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero or
even negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs).<br><br>This is
why so many of the best programmers are libertarians.
In our world, you sink or swim, and there are no excuses.
When those far removed from the creation of wealth-- undergraduates,
reporters, politicians-- hear
that the richest 5% of the people have 
half the total wealth, they tend to think <i>injustice!</i>
An experienced programmer would be more likely to think
<i>is that all?</i>  The top 5% of programmers
probably write 99% of the good software.<br><br>Wealth can be created without being sold.  Scientists, till
recently at least, effectively donated the wealth they 
created.  We are all richer for knowing about penicillin,
because we&apos;re less likely to die from infections.  Wealth
is whatever people want, and not dying is certainly something
we want.  Hackers often donate their work by 
writing open source software that anyone can use for free.
I am much the richer for the operating system
FreeBSD, which I&apos;m running on the computer I&apos;m using now,
and so is Yahoo, which runs it on all their servers.<br><br><b>What a Job Is</b><br><br>In industrialized countries, people belong to one institution or
another at least until their twenties.  After all those years you get
used to the idea of belonging to a group of people who all get up
in the morning, go to some set of buildings, and do things that they
do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing.  Belonging to such a group becomes
part of your identity: name, age, role, institution.
If you have to introduce yourself, or
someone else describes you, it will be as something like, John
Smith, age 10, a student at such and such elementary school, or
John Smith, age 20, a student at such and such college.<br><br>When John Smith finishes school he is expected to get a job.  And
what getting a job seems to mean is joining another institution.
Superficially it&apos;s a lot like college.  You pick the companies you
want to work for and apply to join them.  If one likes you, you
become a member of this new group.  You get up in the morning and
go to a new set of buildings, and do things that you do not, ordinarily,
enjoy doing.  There are a few differences: life is not as much fun,
and you get paid, instead of paying, as you did in college.  But
the similarities feel greater than the differences.  John Smith is
now John Smith, 22, a software developer at such and such corporation.<br><br>In fact John Smith&apos;s
life has changed more than he realizes.  Socially, a company
looks much like college, but the deeper you go into the
underlying reality, the more different it gets.<br><br>What a company does, and has to do if it wants to continue to
exist, is earn money.  And the way most companies make money
is by creating wealth.  Companies can be so specialized that this
similarity is concealed, but it is not only manufacturing 
companies that create wealth.  A big component of wealth is
location. 
Remember that magic machine that could
make you cars and cook you dinner and so on?  It would not be
so useful if it delivered your dinner to a random location
in central Asia.  
If wealth means what people want, companies that move
things also create wealth.  Ditto for
many other kinds of companies that don&apos;t make anything
physical.  Nearly all companies exist to do something people
want.<br><br>And that&apos;s what you do, as well, when you go to work for a company.
But here there is another layer that tends to obscure the underlying
reality.  In a company, the work you do is averaged together with
a lot of other people&apos;s.  
You may not even be aware you&apos;re doing something people
want.  Your contribution may be indirect.  But the company as a
whole must be giving people something they want, or they won&apos;t make
any money.  And if they are paying you x dollars a year, then on
average you must be contributing at least x dollars a year worth
of work, or the company will be spending more than it makes,
and will go out of business.<br><br>Someone graduating from college thinks, and is told, that he needs
to get a job, as if the important thing were becoming a member of 
an institution.  A more direct way to put it would be: you need to
start doing something people want.  You don&apos;t
need to
join a company to do that.  All a company is is a group of people
working together to do something people want.  It&apos;s doing something people
want that matters, not joining the group. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>For most people the   
best plan probably is to go to work for some existing
company.  But it is a good idea to understand what&apos;s happening   
when you do this.  A job means doing something people want,
averaged together with everyone else in that company.<br><br><b>Working Harder</b><br><br>That averaging gets to be a problem.
I think the single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the   
difficulty of assigning a value to each person&apos;s work. 
For the most part they punt.  In a
big company you get paid a fairly predictable salary for working 
fairly hard.  You&apos;re expected not to be obviously incompetent or
lazy, but you&apos;re not expected to devote your whole life to your
work.<br><br>It turns out, though, that there are economies of scale in how much of your
life you devote to your work.  In the right kind of business,  
someone who really devoted himself to work could generate ten or
even a hundred times as much wealth as an average
employee.  A programmer, for example, instead of chugging along
maintaining and updating an existing piece of software, could write
a whole new piece of software, and with it create a new source of
revenue.<br><br>Companies are not set up to reward people who want to do this. 
You can&apos;t go to your boss and say, I&apos;d like to start working ten
times as hard, so will you please pay me ten times as much? For
one thing, the official fiction is that you are already working as
hard as you can.  But a more serious problem is that the company
has no way of measuring the value of your work.<br><br>Salesmen are an exception.  It&apos;s easy 
to measure how much revenue they generate, and they&apos;re
usually paid a percentage of it.  If a salesman wants to work harder,
he can just start doing it, and he will automatically
get paid proportionally more.<br><br>There is one other job besides sales where big companies can
hire first-rate people: in the top management jobs. 
And for the same reason: their performance can
be measured.  The top managers are
held responsible for the performance of the entire company.
Because an ordinary employee&apos;s performance can&apos;t usually
be measured, he is not expected to do
more than put in a solid effort.  Whereas top management, like
salespeople, have to actually come up with the numbers.
The CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in  
a solid effort.  If the company does badly, he&apos;s done badly.<br><br>A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly   
would be enormously successful.  Many employees would work harder
if they could get paid for it.  More importantly,
such a company would attract people who wanted to work
especially hard. 
It would crush its competitors.<br><br>Unfortunately, companies can&apos;t pay everyone like salesmen.  Salesmen
work alone.  Most employees&apos; work is tangled together.  Suppose
a company makes some kind of consumer gadget.  The 
engineers build a reliable gadget with all kinds of new features;
the industrial designers design a beautiful case for it; and then
the marketing people convince everyone that
it&apos;s something they&apos;ve got to have.  How do you know how much of the
gadget&apos;s sales are due to each group&apos;s efforts?  Or, for that
matter, how much is due to the creators of past gadgets that gave
the company a reputation for quality?  There&apos;s no way to  
untangle all their contributions.  Even if you could read the minds
of the consumers, you&apos;d find these factors were all blurred together.<br><br>If you want to go faster, it&apos;s a problem to have your work
tangled together with a large number of other people&apos;s.  In a  
large group, your performance is not separately measurable-- and 
the rest of the group slows you down.<br><br><b>Measurement and Leverage</b><br><br>To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two
things, measurement and leverage.  You need to be in a
position where your performance can be measured, or there is
no way to get paid more by doing more.  And you have to
have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have   
a big effect.<br><br>Measurement alone is not enough.  An example of a job with
measurement but not leverage is doing piecework in a
sweatshop.  Your performance is measured and you get paid  
accordingly, but you have no scope for decisions.  The only
decision you get to make is how fast you work, and that
can probably only increase your earnings by a factor
of two or three.<br><br>An example of a job with both measurement and leverage would
be lead actor in a movie.  Your performance can be measured in the
gross of the movie.  And you have leverage in the sense that your
performance can make or break it.<br><br>CEOs also have both measurement and leverage.  They&apos;re measured,
in that the performance of the company is their performance.
And they have leverage in that their decisions
set the whole company moving in one direction or another.<br><br>I think everyone who gets rich by their own efforts will be
found to be in a situation with measurement and leverage.    
Everyone I can think of does: CEOs, movie stars, 
hedge fund managers, professional athletes.  A good hint to the
presence of leverage is the possibility of failure.
Upside must be balanced by downside, so if there is 
big potential for gain there must also be a terrifying
possibility of loss.  CEOs, stars, fund managers, and athletes
all live with the sword hanging over their heads;
the moment they start to suck, they&apos;re out.  If you&apos;re in
a job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich,
because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage.<br><br>But you don&apos;t have to become a CEO or a movie star to
be in a situation with measurement and leverage.  All you        
need to do is be part of a small group working on a
hard problem.<br><br><b>Smallness = Measurement</b><br><br>If you can&apos;t measure the value of the work done by individual  
employees, you can get close.  You can measure the value
of the work done by small groups.<br><br>One level at which you can accurately measure the revenue
generated by employees is at the level of the whole company.   
When the company is small, you are thereby fairly close to 
measuring the contributions of individual employees.  A viable
startup might only have ten employees, which puts you within a
factor of ten of measuring individual effort.<br><br>Starting or joining a startup is thus as close as most
people can get to saying to one&apos;s boss, I want to work ten times
as hard, so please pay me ten times as much.  There are two
differences: you&apos;re not saying it to your boss, but directly to the
customers (for whom your boss is only a proxy after all), and
you&apos;re not doing it individually, but along with a small group
of other ambitious people.<br><br>It will, ordinarily, be a group.  Except in a few unusual kinds
of work, like acting or writing books, you can&apos;t be a company 
of one person.  
And the people you work with had better be good, because it&apos;s their work that
yours is going to be averaged with.<br><br>A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers.
Two things keep the speed of the
galley down.  One is that individual rowers don&apos;t see any
result from working harder. 
The other is that, in a group of a
thousand people, the average rower is likely  to be
pretty average.<br><br>If you took ten people at random out of the big galley and
put them in a boat by themselves, they could probably go  
faster.  They would have both carrot and stick to motivate   
them.  An energetic rower would be encouraged by the thought
that he could have a visible effect on the speed of
the boat.  And if someone was lazy, the others would be more likely
to notice and complain.<br><br>But the real advantage of the ten-man boat shows when 
you take the ten <i>best</i> rowers out of the big galley
and put them in a boat together.  They will have all
the extra motivation that comes from being in a small group.
But more importantly, by selecting that small a group
you can get the best rowers.  Each one will be in
the top 1%.  It&apos;s a much better deal for them to average  
their work together with a small group of their peers than to    
average it with everyone.<br><br>That&apos;s the real point of startups.  Ideally, you are getting
together with a group of other people who also want to work
a lot harder, and get paid a lot more, than they would in
a big company.  And because startups tend to get founded 
by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already 
know one another (at least by reputation), the level of 
measurement is more precise than you get from smallness alone.
A startup is not merely ten people, but ten people like you.<br><br>Steve Jobs once said that the success or failure of a startup
depends on the first ten employees.  I agree. If 
anything, it&apos;s more like the first five.
Being small is not, in itself, what makes startups kick butt,   
but rather that small groups can be select.
You don&apos;t want small in the sense of a
village, but small in the sense of an all-star team.<br><br>The larger a group, the closer its average member will be to the average
for the population as a whole.   So all other things being
equal, a very able person in a big company is probably
getting a bad deal, because his performance is dragged down by
the overall lower performance of the others.  Of course,
all other things often are not equal: the able person may 
not care about money, or may prefer the stability of a large
company.  But a very able person who does care about money
will ordinarily do better to go off and work with a small
group of peers.<br><br><b>Technology = Leverage</b><br><br>Startups offer anyone a way to be in a situation with
measurement and leverage.
They allow measurement because they&apos;re small,
and they offer leverage because they
make money by inventing new technology.<br><br>What is technology?  It&apos;s <i>technique</i>. It&apos;s the way  
we all do things.  And when
you discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied
by all the people who use it.  It is the proverbial fishing
rod, rather than the fish.  That&apos;s the difference between a
startup and a restaurant or a barber shop.  You fry eggs or cut 
hair one customer at a time.  Whereas if 
you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about,
you help everyone who uses your solution.  
That&apos;s leverage.<br><br>If you look at history, it seems that most people
who got rich by creating wealth did it by developing
new technology.  You just can&apos;t fry eggs or cut hair fast enough.
What made the Florentines rich in 1200 
was the discovery of new techniques for making the high-tech 
product of the time, fine woven cloth.  What made the
Dutch rich in 1600 was the discovery of shipbuilding and
navigation techniques that enabled them to dominate the seas
of the Far East.<br><br>Fortunately there is a natural fit between smallness and
solving hard problems.  The leading edge of technology moves
fast.  Technology that&apos;s valuable today could be worthless
in a couple years.  Small companies are more at home in this
world, because they don&apos;t have layers of bureaucracy to
slow them down.
Also, technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches,
and small companies are less constrained by convention.<br><br>Big companies can develop technology.  They just can&apos;t do it
quickly.  Their size makes them slow and prevents
them from rewarding employees for the extraordinary
effort required.  So in practice big companies only get to develop 
technology in fields where large capital requirements prevent startups from
competing with them, like microprocessors, power plants, 
or passenger aircraft.  And even in those fields they depend heavily
on startups for components and ideas.<br><br>It&apos;s obvious that biotech or software startups exist to solve
hard technical problems, but 
I think it will also be found to be true 
in businesses that don&apos;t seem to be about technology.  McDonald&apos;s,
for example, grew big by designing a system, the McDonald&apos;s 
franchise, that could then be reproduced at will all over the 
face of the earth.  A McDonald&apos;s franchise is controlled by rules
so precise that it is practically
a piece of software.  Write once, run everywhere.
Ditto for Wal-Mart.  Sam Walton got rich not by being a 
retailer, but by designing a new kind of store.<br><br>Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall
aim of your company, but also at decision points along the way.
At Viaweb one of our rules of thumb was <i>run upstairs.</i>
Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big,
fat, bully.  You open a door and find yourself in a    
staircase.  Do you go up or down?  I say up.  The
bully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can.
Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage.
Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him.<br><br>What this meant in practice was that we deliberately sought      
hard problems.  If there were two features we could add to our
software, both equally valuable in proportion to their difficulty,
we&apos;d always take the harder one.  Not just because it was 
more valuable, but <i>because it was harder.</i>
We delighted in forcing bigger, slower competitors
to follow us over difficult ground.
Like guerillas, startups prefer the difficult terrain of the
mountains, where the troops of the central government
can&apos;t follow.  I can remember times when we were just
exhausted after wrestling all day with some horrible technical
problem.  And I&apos;d be delighted, because something that was 
hard for us would be impossible for our competitors.<br><br>This is not just a good way to run a startup.  It&apos;s what
a startup is.
Venture capitalists know about this and have a phrase for it:
<i>barriers to entry.</i>  If you go to a VC with a new 
idea and ask him to invest in it, one of the first things
he&apos;ll ask is, how hard would this be for someone else to  
develop?  That is, how much difficult ground
have you put between yourself and potential pursuers? 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font>
And you had better have a convincing explanation of why 
your technology would be hard to duplicate.  Otherwise as
soon as some big company becomes aware of it, they&apos;ll make
their own, and with their brand name, capital, and
distribution clout, they&apos;ll take away your market overnight.
You&apos;d be like guerillas caught in the open field by regular
army forces.<br><br>One way to put up barriers to entry is through patents. 
But patents may not provide much protection. 
Competitors commonly find ways to work around a patent.
And if they can&apos;t, they 
may simply violate it and invite you to sue them.
A big company is not afraid to be sued; it&apos;s an everyday thing
for them.  They&apos;ll make sure that suing them is expensive and
takes a long time.
Ever heard of Philo Farnsworth?  He invented
television.  The reason you&apos;ve never
heard of him is that his company was not the one to make
money from it. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font>
The company that did was RCA, and
Farnsworth&apos;s reward for his efforts was a decade of
patent litigation.<br><br>Here, as so often, the best defense is a good offense.  If
you can develop technology that&apos;s simply too hard for
competitors to duplicate, you don&apos;t need to rely on other
defenses.  Start by picking a hard problem, and
then at every decision point, take the harder choice. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>The Catch(es)</b><br><br>If it were simply a matter of working harder than 
an ordinary employee and getting paid proportionately, it would
obviously be a good deal to start a startup.  Up to a point it
would be more fun. I don&apos;t think many people 
like the slow pace of big companies, the interminable meetings,
the water-cooler conversations, the clueless middle managers,
and so on.<br><br>Unfortunately there are a couple catches.  One is that you
can&apos;t choose the point on the curve that you want to inhabit.
You can&apos;t decide, for example, that you&apos;d like to work just
two or three times as hard, and get paid that much more.  When
you&apos;re running a startup, your competitors decide how
hard you work.  And they pretty much all make the same decision:
as hard as you possibly can.<br><br>The other catch is that the payoff is only on average proportionate
to your productivity.  There is, as I said before, a large
random multiplier in the success of any company.  So in
practice the deal is not that you&apos;re 30 times as productive and get 
paid 30 times as much.  It is that you&apos;re 30 times as productive,
and get paid between zero and a thousand times as much.
If the mean is 30x, the median is probably zero.
Most startups tank, and not just the dogfood 
portals we all heard about during
the Internet Bubble.  It&apos;s common for a startup
to be developing a genuinely good product, take slightly
too long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut down.<br><br>A startup is like a mosquito.  A bear can absorb a hit and a crab
is armored against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing:
to score.  No energy is wasted on defense.  The defense of mosquitos, 
as a species, is that there are a lot of them, but this is little 
consolation to the individual mosquito.<br><br>Startups, like mosquitos, tend to be an all-or-nothing proposition.
And you don&apos;t generally know which of the two you&apos;re going to
get till the last minute. 
Viaweb came close to tanking several times. Our trajectory
was like a sine wave.  Fortunately we got bought at
the top of the cycle, but it was damned close.   While we were
visiting Yahoo in California to talk about selling the company
to them, we had to borrow a conference room to reassure
an investor who was about to back out of a new round of funding 
that we needed to stay alive.<br><br>The all-or-nothing aspect of startups was not something we wanted.
Viaweb&apos;s hackers were all extremely risk-averse.
If there had been some way just to work super hard and get
paid for it, without having a lottery mixed in, we would have
been delighted.  We would have much preferred a 100% chance of
$1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, even though 
theoretically the second is worth twice as much.   Unfortunately,
there is not currently any space in the business world where
you can get the first deal.<br><br>The closest you can get is by
selling your startup in the early stages, giving up upside  
(and risk) for a smaller but guaranteed payoff.  We had a 
chance to do this, and stupidly, as we then thought, let it slip by.
After that we became comically eager to sell.
For the next year or so,
if anyone expressed the slightest curiosity about Viaweb
we would try to sell them the company.  But there were no takers,
so we had to keep going.<br><br>It would have been a bargain to 
buy us at an early stage, but companies doing acquisitions are not
looking for bargains.  A company big enough to acquire 
startups will be big enough to be fairly conservative, and 
within the company the people in charge of acquisitions will
be among the more conservative, because they are likely to be
business school types who joined the company late.  
They would rather overpay for a safe choice.  So
it is easier to sell an established startup, even at a large
premium, than an early-stage one.<br><br><b>Get Users</b><br><br>I think it&apos;s a good idea to get bought, if you can.  Running a
business is different from growing one.
It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach 
cruising altitude.  It&apos;s
also financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify.
What would you think of a financial advisor who put all his
client&apos;s assets into one volatile stock?<br><br>How do you get bought?  Mostly by doing the same things 
you&apos;d do if you didn&apos;t intend to sell the company.  Being 
profitable, for example.   But getting bought is also an art
in its own right, and one that we spent a lot of time trying
to master.<br><br>Potential buyers will
always delay if they can.  The hard part about getting
bought is getting them to act.  For most people, the most powerful motivator
is not the hope of gain, but the fear of loss.  For potential
acquirers, the most powerful motivator is the prospect that 
one of their competitors will buy you.  This, as we found, 
causes CEOs to take red-eyes.  
The second biggest is the worry that, if they don&apos;t buy you 
now, you&apos;ll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more to
acquire later, or even become a competitor.<br><br>In both cases, what it all comes down to is users.  
You&apos;d think that a company about to buy you would do a lot of
research and decide for themselves how valuable your technology
was.  Not at all.  What they go by is the number of users you
have.<br><br>In effect, acquirers assume the customers know who has the
best technology.  And this is not as stupid as it sounds.  Users 
are the only real proof that you&apos;ve created wealth.  Wealth is 
what people want, and if people aren&apos;t using your software,
maybe it&apos;s not just because you&apos;re bad at marketing.  Maybe it&apos;s
because you haven&apos;t made what they want.<br><br>Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch out for.
Near the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are 
obsessed with solving interesting technical problems, instead
of making users happy.  In a startup, you&apos;re not just trying to
solve problems.  You&apos;re trying to solve problems <i>that 
users care about.</i><br><br>So I think you should make users the test, just as 
acquirers do.  Treat a startup as an optimization problem 
in which performance is measured by number of users.  As anyone
who has tried to optimize software knows, the key is measurement.
When you try to guess where your program is slow, and what would
make it faster, you almost always guess wrong.<br><br>Number of users may not be the perfect test, but it will 
be very close.  It&apos;s what acquirers care about.  It&apos;s what 
revenues depend on.  
It&apos;s what makes competitors unhappy.
It&apos;s what impresses reporters, and potential
new users.  Certainly it&apos;s a better test than your a priori
notions of what problems are important to solve, no matter how
technically adept you are.<br><br>Among other things, treating a startup as an optimization
problem will help you avoid another
pitfall that VCs worry about, and rightly-- taking a long time
to develop a product.  Now we can recognize this as something
hackers already know to avoid: premature optimization.  Get a version 
1.0 out there as soon as you can.  Until you have some users to
measure, you&apos;re optimizing based on guesses.<br><br>The ball you need to keep your eye on here is the underlying
principle that wealth is what people want.  If you plan to get 
rich by creating wealth, you have to know what people want.  
So few businesses really pay attention to making customers happy.
How often do you walk into a store, or call a company on the
phone, with a feeling of dread in the back of your mind?
When you hear &quot;your call is important to us, please stay on
the line,&quot; do you think, oh good, now everything will be all right?<br><br>A restaurant can afford to serve the occasional burnt dinner.
But in technology, you cook one thing and that&apos;s what everyone
eats.  So any difference between what people want and what
you deliver is multiplied.  
You please or annoy
customers wholesale.  The closer you can get to what they want,
the more wealth you generate.<br><br><b>Wealth and Power</b><br><br>Making wealth is not the only way to get rich.  For most of
human history it has not even been the most common.  Until
a few centuries ago,
the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs,
land, and cattle,
and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance,
marriage, conquest, or confiscation.  
Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.<br><br>Two things changed.  The first was the rule of law.  For most of the world&apos;s
history, if you did somehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his 
henchmen 
would find a way to steal it.
But in medieval Europe something new happened.
A new class of merchants and manufacturers
began to collect in towns. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#777777">10</font></a>]</font>
Together they were able to withstand the local feudal
lord.  So 
for the first time in our history, the bullies stopped stealing the
nerds&apos; lunch money.
This was naturally a great incentive,
and possibly indeed the main cause of the second big change,
industrialization.<br><br>A great deal has been written about the causes of the Industrial 
Revolution.  But surely a necessary, if not sufficient, condition
was that people who made fortunes be able to enjoy them in peace.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#777777">11</font></a>]</font>
One piece of evidence is what happened to countries
that tried to return to the old model, like the Soviet
Union, and to a lesser extent Britain under the labor
governments of the 1960s and early 1970s.  Take away the incentive
of wealth, and technical innovation grinds to a halt.<br><br>Remember what a startup is, economically: 
a way of saying, I want to work faster.  Instead of accumulating
money slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I 
want to get it over with as soon as possible.  So governments
that forbid you to accumulate wealth are in effect decreeing
that you work slowly.  They&apos;re willing to let you earn $3 million over
fifty years, but they&apos;re not willing to let you work so hard that
you can do it in two.  They are like
the corporate boss that you can&apos;t go to and say, I want to work
ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times a much.
Except this is not a boss you can escape by starting your own
company.<br><br>The problem with working slowly is not just that technical
innovation happens slowly.  It&apos;s that it tends not to happen at all.
It&apos;s only when you&apos;re deliberately looking for hard problems,
as a way to use speed to the greatest advantage, that you take
on this kind of project.  Developing new technology is a 
pain in the ass. It is, as Edison said, one percent 
inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.  
Without the incentive of wealth, no one wants to do it.
Engineers will work on sexy projects like fighter planes and moon
rockets for ordinary salaries, but more mundane technologies
like light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs.<br><br>Startups
are not just something that happened in Silicon Valley in 
the last couple decades.  Since it became possible to
get rich by creating wealth, everyone who has done it has
used essentially the same recipe: measurement and leverage,
where measurement comes from working with a small
group, and leverage from developing new techniques.
The recipe was the same in Florence in 1200 as it is 
in Santa Clara today.<br><br>Understanding this may help to answer an important question:
why Europe grew so powerful.
Was it something about the geography of 
Europe?  Was it that Europeans are somehow racially superior?
Was it their religion?  The answer (or at least
the proximate cause) may be that the
Europeans 
rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who
made a lot of money to keep it.<br><br>Once you&apos;re allowed to do that, 
people who want to get rich can do it by generating
wealth instead of stealing it.
The resulting technological growth translates not only 
into wealth but into military power.  The theory that led to
the stealth plane was developed by a Soviet mathematician.
But because the Soviet Union didn&apos;t have a computer industry,
it remained for them a theory;
they didn&apos;t have hardware capable of executing the calculations
fast enough to design an actual airplane.<br><br>In that respect the Cold War teaches the same lesson as
World War II and, for that matter, most wars in recent history.
Don&apos;t let a ruling
class of warriors and politicians squash the entrepreneurs.
The same recipe that makes individuals rich
makes countries powerful.  Let the nerds keep their lunch
money, and you rule the world.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
One valuable thing you tend to get only in startups is
<i>uninterruptability</i>.  Different kinds of
work have different time quanta.  Someone proofreading a
manuscript
could probably be interrupted every fifteen minutes
with little loss of productivity.  But the time quantum for
hacking is very long: it might take an hour just to load
a problem into your head.  So the
cost of having someone from personnel
call you about a form you forgot to fill out can be huge.<br><br>This is why hackers give you such a baleful stare as they
turn from their screen to answer your question.  Inside
their heads a giant house of cards is tottering.<br><br>The mere possibility of being interrupted deters hackers
from starting hard projects.  This is why they
tend to work late at night, and why it&apos;s next to impossible
to write great software in a cubicle (except late at night).<br><br>One great advantage of startups is that they don&apos;t yet have
any of the people who interrupt you.  There is no personnel
department, and thus no form nor anyone to call you about it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Faced with the idea that people working for startups might be
20 or 30 times as productive as those working for large companies,
executives at large companies will naturally wonder, how could
I get the people working for me to do that?  The answer is
simple: pay them to.<br><br>Internally most companies are run like Communist states.
If you believe in free markets, why not turn your company into one?<br><br>Hypothesis: A company will be maximally profitable when each
employee is paid in proportion to the wealth they generate.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Until recently even governments sometimes didn&apos;t grasp the
distinction between money and wealth.  Adam
Smith (<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, v:i) mentions several
that tried to preserve their
&quot;wealth&quot; by forbidding the export of gold or silver.
But having more of the medium of exchange would not make
a country richer; if you have more money chasing the same
amount of material wealth, the only result is higher prices.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
There are many senses of the word &quot;wealth,&quot; not all of
them material.  I&apos;m not trying to make a deep philosophical
point here about which
is the true kind.  I&apos;m writing about one specific,
rather technical sense of the word &quot;wealth.&quot;  What
people will give you money for.
This is an interesting sort of wealth to study, because
it is the kind that prevents you from starving.
And what people will give you money for depends on them,
not you.<br><br>When you&apos;re starting a business,
it&apos;s easy to slide into thinking that customers
want what you do.  During the Internet Bubble I talked
to a woman who, because she liked the outdoors, was
starting an &quot;outdoor portal.&quot; You know what
kind of business you should start if you like
the outdoors?  One to recover data from crashed hard disks.<br><br>What&apos;s the connection?  None at all.  Which is precisely my point.
If you want
to create wealth (in the narrow technical sense of not
starving) then you should be especially skeptical about any
plan that centers on things you like doing.
That is where your idea of what&apos;s valuable is least
likely to coincide with other people&apos;s.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
In the average car restoration you probably do make everyone
else microscopically poorer, by doing a small amount of damage to
the environment.  While environmental costs should be taken
into account, they don&apos;t
make wealth a zero-sum game.  For example, if you repair
a machine that&apos;s broken because a part has come unscrewed,
you create wealth with no environmental cost.<br><br>[<a name="f5bn"><font color="#000000">5b</font></a>]

Many people feel confused and depressed in
their early twenties.  Life seemed so much more fun in college.
Well, of course it was.  Don&apos;t be fooled by the surface similarities.
You&apos;ve gone from guest to servant.
It&apos;s possible to have fun in this new world. 
Among other things, you now get to go behind the doors that say
&quot;authorized personnel only.&quot;
But the change is a shock at first, and all the worse

When VCs asked us how long it would take another startup
to duplicate our software, we used to reply that they probably
wouldn&apos;t be able to at all. I think this made us seem naive,

Few technologies have one clear inventor.  So as
a rule, if you know the &quot;inventor&quot; of something
(the telephone, the assembly line, the airplane, 
the light bulb, the transistor) it is because their
company made money from it, and the company&apos;s PR people worked
hard to spread the story.  If you don&apos;t know who invented
something (the automobile, the television, the computer,
the jet engine, the laser), it&apos;s because other companies
made all the money.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
This is a good plan for life in general.
If you have two choices, choose the harder.
If you&apos;re trying to decide whether to go out running or
sit home and watch TV, go running.
Probably the reason this trick works so well is that
when you have two choices and one is harder, the
only reason you&apos;re even considering the other is laziness.
You know in the back of your mind what&apos;s the right thing
to do, and this trick merely forces you to acknowledge it.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
It is probably no accident that the middle class
first appeared in northern Italy and the low countries,
where there were no strong central governments.   These two
regions were the richest of their time and became the twin
centers from which Renaissance civilization radiated.
If they no longer play that role, it is because
other places, like the United States, have been truer to the
principles they discovered.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
It may indeed be a sufficient condition.  But if so, why didn&apos;t
the Industrial Revolution happen earlier?  Two possible (and
not incompatible) answers: (a) It did.  
The Industrial Revolution was one in a series.
(b) Because in medieval towns, monopolies
and guild regulations initially slowed the development of new means
of production.<br><br><a href="http://reddit.com"><img src="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/redditino.png" border="0"></a>

do it best tend to be far better than everyone else.  There&apos;s a
huge gap between Leonardo and second-rate contemporaries like
Borgognone.  You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the
average writer of detective novels.  A top-ranked professional chess
player could play ten thousand games against an ordinary club player
without losing once.<br><br>Like chess or painting or writing novels, making money is a very
specialized skill.   But for some reason we treat this skill
differently.  No one complains when a few people surpass all the
rest at playing chess or writing novels, but when a few people make
more money than the rest, we get editorials saying this is wrong.<br><br>Why?  The pattern of variation seems no different than for any other
skill.  What causes people to react so strongly when the skill is
making money?<br><br>I think there are three reasons we treat making money as different:
the misleading model of wealth we learn as children; the disreputable
way in which, till recently, most fortunes were accumulated; and
the worry that great variations in income are somehow bad for
society.  As far as I can tell, the first is mistaken, the second
outdated, and the third empirically false.  Could it be that, in a
modern democracy, variation in income is actually a sign of health?<br><br><b>The Daddy Model of Wealth</b><br><br>When I was five I thought electricity was created by electric
sockets.  I didn&apos;t realize there were power plants out there
generating it.  Likewise, it doesn&apos;t occur to most kids that wealth
is something that has to be generated.  It seems to be something
that flows from parents.<br><br>Because of the circumstances in which they encounter it, children
tend to misunderstand wealth.  They confuse it with money.  They
think that there is a fixed amount of it.  And they think of it as
something that&apos;s distributed by authorities (and so should be
distributed equally), rather than something that has to be created
(and might be created unequally).<br><br>In fact, wealth is not money.  Money is just a convenient way of
trading one form of wealth for another.  Wealth is the underlying
stuff&#x2014;the goods and services we buy.  When you travel to a
rich or poor country, you don&apos;t have to look at people&apos;s bank
accounts to tell which kind you&apos;re in.  You can <i>see</i>
wealth&#x2014;in buildings and streets, in the clothes and the health
of the people.<br><br>Where does wealth come from?  People make it.  This was easier to
grasp when most people lived on farms, and made many of the things
they wanted with their own hands.  Then you could see in the house,
the herds, and the granary the wealth that each family created.  It
was obvious then too that the wealth of the world was not a fixed
quantity that had to be shared out, like slices of a pie.  If you
wanted more wealth, you could make it.<br><br>This is just as true today, though few of us create wealth directly
for ourselves (except for a few vestigial domestic tasks).  Mostly
we create wealth for other people in exchange for money, which we
then trade for the forms of wealth we want. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Because kids are unable to create wealth, whatever they have has
to be given to them.  And when wealth is something you&apos;re given,
then of course it seems that it should be distributed equally.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>
As in most families it is.  The kids see to that.  &quot;Unfair,&quot; they
cry, when one sibling gets more than another.<br><br>In the real world, you can&apos;t keep living off your parents.  If you
want something, you either have to make it, or do something of
equivalent value for someone else, in order to get them to give you
enough money to buy it.  In the real world, wealth is (except for
a few specialists like thieves and speculators) something you have
to create, not something that&apos;s distributed by Daddy.  And since
the ability and desire to create it vary from person to person,
it&apos;s not made equally.<br><br>You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those
who make more money are often simply better at doing what people
want.  Top actors make a lot more money than B-list actors.  The
B-list actors might be almost as charismatic, but when people go
to the theater and look at the list of movies playing, they want
that extra oomph that the big stars have.<br><br>Doing what people want is not the only way to get money, of course.
You could also rob banks, or solicit bribes, or establish a monopoly.
Such tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed for
some of the biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the root
cause of variation in income.  The root cause of variation in income,
as Occam&apos;s Razor implies, is the same as the root cause of variation
in every other human skill.<br><br>In the United States, the CEO of a large public company makes about
100 times as much as the average person. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
Basketball players
make about 128 times as much, and baseball players 72 times as much.
Editorials quote this kind of statistic with horror.  But I have
no trouble imagining that one person could be 100 times as productive
as another.  In ancient Rome the price of <i>slaves</i> varied by
a factor of 50 depending on their skills. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
And that&apos;s without
considering motivation, or the extra leverage in productivity that
you can get from modern technology.<br><br>Editorials about athletes&apos; or CEOs&apos; salaries remind me of early
Christian writers, arguing from first principles about whether the
Earth was round, when they could just walk outside and check.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font>
How much someone&apos;s work is worth is not a policy question.  It&apos;s
something the market already determines.<br><br>&quot;Are they really worth 100 of us?&quot; editorialists ask.  Depends on
what you mean by worth.  If you mean worth in the sense of what
people will pay for their skills, the answer is yes, apparently.<br><br>A few CEOs&apos; incomes reflect some kind of wrongdoing.  But are there
not others whose incomes really do reflect the wealth they generate?
Steve Jobs saved a company that was in a terminal decline.  And not
merely in the way a turnaround specialist does, by cutting costs;
he had to decide what Apple&apos;s next products should be.  Few others
could have done it.  And regardless of the case with CEOs, it&apos;s
hard to see how anyone could argue that the salaries of professional
basketball players don&apos;t reflect supply and demand.<br><br>It may seem unlikely in principle that one individual could really
generate so much more wealth than another.  The key to this mystery
is to revisit that question, are they really worth 100 of us?
<i>Would</i> a basketball team trade one of their players for 100
random people?  What would Apple&apos;s next product look like if you
replaced Steve Jobs with a committee of 100 random people? 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font>
These
things don&apos;t scale linearly.  Perhaps the CEO or the professional
athlete has only ten times (whatever that means) the skill and
determination of an ordinary person.  But it makes all the difference
that it&apos;s concentrated in one individual.<br><br>When we say that one kind of work is overpaid and another underpaid,
what are we really saying?  In a free market, prices are determined
by what buyers want.  People like baseball more than  poetry, so
baseball players make more than poets.  To say that a certain kind
of work is underpaid is thus identical with saying that people want
the wrong things.<br><br>Well, of course people want the wrong things.  It seems odd to be
surprised by that.  And it seems even odder to say that it&apos;s
<i>unjust</i> that certain kinds of work are underpaid. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font>
Then
you&apos;re saying that it&apos;s unjust that people want the wrong things.
It&apos;s  lamentable that people prefer reality TV and corndogs to
Shakespeare and steamed vegetables, but unjust?  That seems like
saying that blue is heavy, or that up is circular.<br><br>The appearance of the word &quot;unjust&quot; here is the unmistakable spectral
signature of the Daddy Model.  Why else would this idea occur in
this odd context?  Whereas if the speaker were still operating on
the Daddy Model, and saw wealth as something that flowed from a
common source and had to be shared out, rather than something
generated by doing what other people wanted, this is exactly what
you&apos;d get on noticing that some people made much more than others.<br><br>When we talk about &quot;unequal distribution of income,&quot; we should
also ask, where does that income come from?
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font>
Who made the wealth
it represents?  Because to the extent that income varies simply
according to how much wealth people create, the distribution may
be unequal, but it&apos;s hardly unjust.<br><br><b>Stealing It</b><br><br>The second reason we tend to find great disparities of wealth
alarming is that for most of human history the usual way to accumulate
a fortune was to steal it: in pastoral societies by cattle raiding;
in agricultural societies by appropriating others&apos; estates in times
of war, and taxing them in times of peace.<br><br>In conflicts, those on the winning side would receive the estates
confiscated from the losers.  In England in the 1060s, when William
the Conqueror distributed the estates of the defeated Anglo-Saxon
nobles to his followers, the conflict was military.  By the 1530s,
when Henry VIII distributed the estates of the monasteries to his
followers, it was mostly political. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font>
But the principle was the
same.  Indeed, the same principle is at work now in Zimbabwe.<br><br>In more organized societies, like China, the ruler and his officials
used taxation instead of confiscation.  But here too we see the
same principle: the way to get rich was not to create wealth, but
to serve a ruler powerful enough to appropriate it.<br><br>This started to change in Europe with the rise of the middle class.
Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor
poor, but originally they were a distinct group.  In a feudal
society, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the
serfs who work their estates.  The middle class were a new, third
group who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing
and trade.<br><br>Starting in the tenth and eleventh centuries, petty nobles and
former serfs banded together in towns that gradually became powerful
enough to ignore the local feudal lords. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#777777">10</font></a>]</font>
Like serfs, the middle
class made a living largely by creating wealth.  (In port cities
like Genoa and Pisa, they also engaged in piracy.) But unlike serfs
they had an incentive to create a lot of it.  Any wealth a serf
created belonged to his master.  There was not much point in making
more than you could hide.  Whereas the independence of the townsmen
allowed them to keep whatever wealth they created.<br><br>Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as
a whole started to get richer very rapidly.  Nearly everything we
have was created by the middle class.  Indeed, the other two classes
have effectively disappeared in industrial societies, and their
names been given to either end of the middle class.  (In the original
sense of the word, Bill Gates is middle class.)<br><br>But it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation
definitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich.  In
England, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and in
fact only started to be called &quot;corruption&quot;) when there started to
be other, faster ways to get rich.<br><br>Seventeenth-century England was much like the third world today,
in that government office was a recognized route to wealth.  The
great fortunes of that time still derived more from what we would
now call corruption than from commerce. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#777777">11</font></a>]</font>
By the nineteenth
century that had changed.  There continued to be bribes, as there
still are everywhere, but politics had by then been left to men who
were driven more by vanity than greed.  Technology had made it
possible to create wealth faster than you could steal it.  The
prototypical rich man of the nineteenth century was not a courtier
but an industrialist.<br><br>With the rise of the middle class, wealth stopped being a zero-sum
game.  Jobs and Wozniak didn&apos;t have to make us poor to make themselves
rich.  Quite the opposite: they created things that made our lives
materially richer.  They had to, or we wouldn&apos;t have paid for them.<br><br>But since for most of the world&apos;s history the main route to wealth
was to steal it, we tend to be suspicious of rich people.  Idealistic
undergraduates find their unconsciously preserved child&apos;s model of
wealth confirmed by eminent writers of the past.  It is a case of
the mistaken meeting the outdated.<br><br>&quot;Behind every great fortune, there is a crime,&quot; Balzac wrote.  Except
he didn&apos;t.  What he actually said was that a great fortune with no
apparent cause was probably due to a crime well enough executed
that it had been forgotten.  If we were talking about Europe in
1000, or most of the third world today, the standard misquotation
would be spot on.  But Balzac lived in nineteenth-century France,
where the Industrial Revolution was well advanced.  He knew you
could make a fortune without stealing it.  After all, he did himself,
as a popular novelist.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#777777">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>Only a few countries (by no coincidence, the richest ones) have
reached this stage.  In most, corruption still has the upper hand.
In most, the fastest way to get wealth is by stealing it.  And so
when we see increasing differences in income in a rich country,
there is a tendency to worry that it&apos;s sliding back toward becoming
another Venezuela.  I think the opposite is happening. I think
you&apos;re seeing a country a full step ahead of Venezuela.<br><br><b>The Lever of Technology</b><br><br>Will technology increase the gap between rich and poor?  It will
certainly increase the gap between the productive and the unproductive.
That&apos;s the whole point of technology.   With a tractor an energetic
farmer could plow six times as much land in a day as he could with
a team of horses.  But only if he mastered a new kind of farming.<br><br>I&apos;ve seen the lever of technology grow visibly in my own time.  In
high school I made money by mowing lawns and scooping ice cream at
Baskin-Robbins.  This was the only kind of work available at the
time.  Now high school kids could write software or design web
sites.  But only some of them will; the rest will still be scooping
ice cream.<br><br>I remember very vividly when in 1985 improved technology made it
possible for me to buy a computer of my own.  Within months I was
using it to make money as a freelance programmer.  A few years
before, I couldn&apos;t have done this.  A few years before, there was
no such <i>thing</i> as a freelance programmer.  But Apple created
wealth, in the form of powerful, inexpensive computers, and programmers
immediately set to work using it to create more.<br><br>As this example suggests, the rate at which technology increases
our productive capacity is probably polynomial, rather than linear.
So we should expect to see ever-increasing variation in individual
productivity as time goes on.   Will that increase the gap between
rich and the poor?  Depends which gap you mean.<br><br>Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to
decrease other gaps.  A hundred years ago, the rich led a different
<i>kind</i> of life from ordinary people.  They lived in houses
full of servants, wore elaborately uncomfortable clothes, and
travelled about in carriages drawn by teams of horses which themselves
required their own houses and servants.  Now, thanks to technology,
the rich live more like the average person.<br><br>Cars are a good example of why.  It&apos;s possible to buy expensive,
handmade cars that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.  But there
is not much point.  Companies make more money by building a large
number of ordinary cars than a small number of expensive ones.  So
a company making a mass-produced car can afford to spend a lot more
on its design.  If you buy a custom-made car, something will always
be breaking.  The only point of buying one now is to advertise that
you can.<br><br>Or consider watches.  Fifty years ago, by spending a lot of money
on a watch you could get better performance.  When watches had
mechanical movements, expensive watches kept better time.  Not any
more.  Since the invention of the quartz movement, an ordinary Timex
is more accurate than a Patek Philippe costing hundreds of thousands
of dollars.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#777777">13</font></a>]</font>
Indeed, as with expensive cars, if you&apos;re determined
to spend a lot of money on a watch, you have to put up with some
inconvenience to do it: as well as keeping worse time, mechanical
watches have to be wound.<br><br>The only thing technology can&apos;t cheapen is brand.  Which is precisely
why we hear ever more about it.  Brand is the residue left as the
substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate.  But what
label you have on your stuff is a much smaller matter than having
it versus not having it.  In 1900, if you kept a carriage, no one
asked what year or brand it was.  If you had one, you were rich.
And if you weren&apos;t rich, you took the omnibus or walked.  Now even
the poorest Americans drive cars, and it is only because we&apos;re so
well trained by advertising that we can even recognize the especially
expensive ones.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#777777">14</font></a>]</font><br><br>The same pattern has played out in industry after industry.  If
there is enough demand for something, technology will make it cheap
enough to sell in large volumes, and the mass-produced versions
will be, if not better, at least more convenient.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#777777">15</font></a>]</font>
And there
is nothing the rich like more than convenience.  The rich people I
know drive the same cars, wear the same clothes, have the same kind
of furniture, and eat the same foods as my other friends.  Their
houses are in different neighborhoods, or if in the same neighborhood
are different sizes, but within them life is similar.  The houses
are made using the same construction techniques and contain much
the same objects.  It&apos;s inconvenient to do something expensive and
custom.<br><br>The rich spend their time more like everyone else too.  Bertie
Wooster seems long gone.  Now, most people who are rich enough not
to work do anyway.  It&apos;s not just social pressure that makes them;
idleness is lonely and demoralizing.<br><br>Nor do we have the social distinctions there were a hundred years
ago.   The novels and etiquette manuals of that period read now
like descriptions of some strange tribal society.  &quot;With respect
to the continuance of friendships...&quot; hints <i>Mrs. Beeton&apos;s Book
of Household Management</i> (1880), &quot;it may be found necessary, in
some cases, for a mistress to relinquish, on assuming the responsibility
of a household, many of those commenced in the earlier part of her
life.&quot; A woman who married a rich man was expected to drop friends
who didn&apos;t.  You&apos;d seem a barbarian if you behaved that way today.
You&apos;d also have a very boring life.  People still tend to segregate
themselves somewhat, but much more on the basis of education than
wealth.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#777777">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>Materially and socially, technology seems to be decreasing the gap
between the rich and the poor, not increasing it.  If Lenin walked
around the offices of a company like Yahoo or Intel or Cisco, he&apos;d
think communism had won.  Everyone would be wearing the same clothes,
have the same kind of office (or rather, cubicle) with the same
furnishings, and address one another by their first names instead
of by honorifics.  Everything would seem exactly as he&apos;d predicted,
until he looked at their bank accounts.  Oops.<br><br>Is it a problem if technology increases that gap?  It doesn&apos;t seem
to be so far.  As it increases the gap in income, it seems to
decrease most other gaps.<br><br><b>Alternative to an Axiom</b><br><br>One often hears a policy criticized on the grounds that it would
increase the income gap between rich and poor.  As if it were an
axiom that this would be bad.  It might be true that increased
variation in income would be bad, but I don&apos;t see how we can say
it&apos;s <i>axiomatic.</i><br><br>Indeed, it may even be false, in industrial democracies.  In a
society of serfs and warlords, certainly, variation in income is a
sign of an underlying problem.  But serfdom is not the only cause
of variation in income.  A 747 pilot doesn&apos;t make 40 times as much
as a checkout clerk because he is a warlord who somehow holds her
in thrall.  His skills are simply much more valuable.<br><br>I&apos;d like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society,
increasing variation in income is a sign of health.  Technology
seems to increase the variation in productivity at faster than
linear rates.  If we don&apos;t see corresponding variation in income,
there are three possible explanations: (a) that technical innovation
has stopped, (b) that the people who would create the most wealth
aren&apos;t doing it, or (c) that they aren&apos;t getting paid for it.<br><br>I think we can safely say that (a) and (b) would be bad.  If you
disagree, try living for a year using only the resources available
to the average Frankish nobleman in 800, and report back to us.
(I&apos;ll be generous and not send you back to the stone age.)<br><br>The only option, if you&apos;re going to have an increasingly prosperous
society without increasing variation in income, seems to be (c),
that people will create a lot of wealth without being paid for it.
That Jobs and Wozniak, for example, will cheerfully work 20-hour
days to produce the Apple computer for a society that allows them,
after taxes, to keep just enough of their income to match what they
would have made working 9 to 5 at a big company.<br><br>Will people create wealth if they can&apos;t get paid for it?  Only if
it&apos;s fun.  People will write operating systems for free.  But they
won&apos;t install them, or take support calls, or train customers to
use them.  And at least 90% of the work that even the highest tech
companies do is of this second, unedifying kind.<br><br>All the unfun kinds of wealth creation slow dramatically in a society
that confiscates private fortunes.  We can confirm this empirically.
Suppose you hear a strange noise that you think may be due to a
nearby fan.  You turn the fan off, and the noise stops.  You turn
the fan back on, and the noise starts again.  Off, quiet.  On,
noise.  In the absence of other information, it would seem the noise
is caused by the fan.<br><br>At various times and places in history, whether you could accumulate
a fortune by creating wealth has been turned on and off.  Northern
Italy in 800, off (warlords would steal it).  Northern Italy in
1100, on.  Central France in 1100, off (still feudal).  England in
1800, on.  England in 1974, off (98% tax on investment income).
United States in 1974, on.  We&apos;ve even had a twin study: West
Germany, on;  East Germany, off.  In every case, the creation of
wealth seems to appear and disappear like the noise of a fan as you
switch on and off the prospect of keeping it.<br><br>There is some momentum involved.  It probably takes at least a
generation to turn people into East Germans (luckily for England).
But if it were merely a fan we were studying, without all the extra
baggage that comes from the controversial topic of wealth, no one
would have any doubt that the fan was causing the noise.<br><br>If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private
fortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as
some modern governments have done, the result always seems to be
the same.    Society as a whole ends up poorer.<br><br>If I had a choice of living in a society where I was materially
much better off than I am now, but was among the poorest, or in one
where I was the richest, but much worse off than I am now, I&apos;d take
the first option.  If I had children, it would arguably be immoral
not to.  It&apos;s absolute poverty you want to avoid, not relative
poverty.  If, as the evidence so far implies, you have to have one
or the other in your society, take relative poverty.<br><br>You need rich people in your society not so much because in spending
their money they create jobs, but because of what they have to do
to <i>get</i> rich.  I&apos;m not talking about the trickle-down effect
here.  I&apos;m not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich, he&apos;ll
hire you as a waiter at his next party.  I&apos;m saying that he&apos;ll make
you a tractor to replace your horse.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Part of the reason this subject is so contentious is that some
of those most vocal on the subject of wealth&#x2014;university
students, heirs, professors, politicians, and journalists&#x2014;have
the least experience creating it.  (This phenomenon will be familiar
to anyone who has overheard conversations about sports in a bar.)<br><br>Students are mostly still on the parental dole, and have not stopped
to think about where that money comes from.  Heirs will be on the
parental dole for life.  Professors and politicians live within
socialist eddies of the economy, at one remove from the creation
of wealth, and are paid a flat rate regardless of how hard they
work.  And journalists as part of their professional code segregate
themselves from the revenue-collecting half of the businesses they
work for (the ad sales department).  Many of these people never
come face to face with the fact that the money they receive represents
wealth&#x2014;wealth that, except in the case of journalists, someone
else created earlier.  They live in a world in which income <i>is</i>
doled out by a central authority according to some abstract notion
of fairness (or randomly, in the case of heirs), rather than given
by other people in return for something they wanted, so it may seem
to them unfair that things don&apos;t work the same in the rest of the
economy.<br><br>(Some professors do create a great deal of wealth for
society.  But the money they&apos;re paid isn&apos;t a <i>quid pro quo</i>.
It&apos;s more in the nature of an investment.)<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]

In the early empire the price of an ordinary adult slave seems
to have been about 2,000 sestertii (e.g. Horace, <i>Sat.</i> ii.7.43).
A servant girl cost 600 (Martial vi.66), while Columella (iii.3.8)
says that a skilled vine-dresser was worth 8,000.  A doctor, P.
Decimus Eros Merula, paid 50,000 sestertii for his freedom (Dessau,
<i>Inscriptiones</i> 7812).  Seneca (<i>Ep.</i> xxvii.7) reports
that one Calvisius Sabinus paid 100,000 sestertii apiece for slaves
learned in the Greek classics.  Pliny (<i>Hist. Nat.</i> vii.39)
says that the highest price paid for a slave up to his time was
700,000 sestertii, for the linguist (and presumably teacher) Daphnis,
but that this had since been exceeded by actors buying their own
freedom.<br><br>Classical Athens saw a similar variation in prices.  An ordinary
laborer was worth about 125 to 150 drachmae.  Xenophon (<i>Mem.</i>
ii.5) mentions prices ranging from 50 to 6,000 drachmae (for the
manager of a silver mine).<br><br>For more on the economics of ancient slavery see:<br><br>Jones, A. H. M., &quot;Slavery in the Ancient World,&quot; <i>Economic History

One of the biggest divergences between the Daddy Model and
reality is the valuation of hard work.  In the Daddy Model, hard
work is in itself deserving.  In reality, wealth is measured by
what one delivers, not how much effort it costs.  If I paint someone&apos;s
house, the owner shouldn&apos;t pay me extra for doing it with a toothbrush.<br><br>It will seem to someone still implicitly operating on the Daddy
Model that it is unfair when someone works hard and doesn&apos;t get
paid much.  To help clarify the matter, get rid of everyone else
and put our worker on a desert island, hunting and gathering fruit.
If he&apos;s bad at it he&apos;ll work very hard and not end up with much
food.  Is this unfair?  Who is being unfair to him?<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Part of the reason for the tenacity of the Daddy Model may be
the dual meaning of &quot;distribution.&quot; When economists talk about
&quot;distribution of income,&quot; they mean statistical distribution.  But
when you use the phrase frequently, you can&apos;t help associating it
with the other sense of the word (as in e.g. &quot;distribution of alms&quot;),
and thereby subconsciously seeing wealth as something that flows
from some central tap.  The word &quot;regressive&quot; as applied to tax
rates has a similar effect, at least on me; how can anything
<i>regressive</i> be good?<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
&quot;From the beginning of the reign Thomas Lord Roos was an assiduous
courtier of the young Henry VIII and was soon to reap the rewards.
In 1525 he was made a Knight of the Garter and given the Earldom
of Rutland.  In the thirties his support of the breach with Rome,
his zeal in crushing the Pilgrimage of Grace, and his readiness to
vote the death-penalty in the succession of spectacular treason
trials that punctuated Henry&apos;s erratic matrimonial progress made
him an obvious candidate for grants of monastic property.&quot;<br><br>Stone, Lawrence, <i>Family and Fortune: Studies in Aristocratic

took bribery to the point of treason.  &quot;As Secretary of State and

To say anything meaningful about income trends, you have to
talk about real income, or income as measured in what it can buy.
But the usual way of calculating real income ignores much of the
growth in wealth over time, because it depends on a consumer price
index created by bolting end to end a series of numbers that are
only locally accurate, and that don&apos;t include the prices of new
inventions until they become so common that their prices stabilize.<br><br>So while we might think it was very much better to live in a world
with antibiotics or air travel or an electric power grid than
without, real income statistics calculated in the usual way will
prove to us that we are only slightly richer for having these things.<br><br>Another approach would be to ask, if you were going back to the
year x in a time machine, how much would you have to spend on trade
goods to make your fortune?  For example, if you were going back
to 1970 it would certainly be less than $500, because the processing
power you can get for $500 today would have been worth at least
$150 million in 1970.  The function goes asymptotic fairly quickly,
because for times over a hundred years or so you could get all you
needed in present-day trash.  In 1800 an empty plastic drink bottle
with a screw top would have seemed a miracle of workmanship.<br><br>[<a name="f16n"><font color="#000000">16</font></a>]
Some will say this amounts to the same thing, because the rich
have better opportunities for education.  That&apos;s a valid point.  It
is still possible, to a degree, to buy your kids&apos; way into top
colleges by sending them to private schools that in effect hack the
college admissions process.<br><br>According to a 2002 report by the National Center for Education
Statistics, about 1.7% of American kids attend private, non-sectarian
schools.  At Princeton, 36% of the class of 2007 came from such
schools.  (Interestingly, the number at Harvard is significantly
lower, about 28%.)  Obviously this is a huge loophole.  It does at
least seem to be closing, not widening.<br><br>Perhaps the designers of admissions processes should take a lesson
from the example of computer security, and instead of just assuming
that their system can&apos;t be hacked, measure the degree to which it
is.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="413"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.liberalismo.org/articulo/392/">Spanish Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="gh">Great Hackers</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">

July 2004<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at Oscon 2004.)</i><br><br><!-- Some programmers are much better than others.  This variation
is one of the most distinctive things about our field.  But I think
it's something more and more fields will see in time.  So if we
can understand this phenomenon, we may be learning about
more than programming.  We may be learning the pattern
for the future.<br><br><b>Edisons</b>
-->
A few months ago I finished a new 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596006624">book</a>, 
and in reviews I keep
noticing words like &quot;provocative&apos;&apos; and &quot;controversial.&apos;&apos; To say
nothing of &quot;idiotic.&apos;&apos;<br><br>I didn&apos;t mean to make the book controversial.  I was trying to make
it efficient.  I didn&apos;t want to waste people&apos;s time telling them
things they already knew.  It&apos;s more efficient just to give them
the diffs.  But I suppose that&apos;s bound to yield an alarming book.<br><br><b>Edisons</b><br><br>There&apos;s no controversy about which idea is most controversial:
the suggestion that variation in wealth might not be as big a
problem as we think.<br><br>I didn&apos;t say in the book that variation in wealth was in itself a
good thing.  I said in some situations it might be a sign of good
things.  A throbbing headache is not a good thing, but it can be
a sign of a good thing-- for example, that you&apos;re recovering
consciousness after being hit on the head.<br><br>Variation in wealth can be a sign of variation in productivity.
(In a society of one, they&apos;re identical.) And <i>that</i>
is almost certainly a good thing: if your society has no variation
in productivity, it&apos;s probably not because everyone is Thomas
Edison.  It&apos;s probably because you have no Thomas Edisons.<br><br>In a low-tech society you don&apos;t see much variation in productivity.
If you have a tribe of nomads collecting sticks for a fire, how
much more productive is the best stick gatherer going to be than
the worst?  A factor of two?  Whereas when you hand people a complex tool
like a computer, the variation in what they can do with
it is enormous.<br><br>That&apos;s not a new idea.  Fred Brooks wrote about it in 1974, and
the study he quoted was published in 1968.  But I think he
underestimated the variation between programmers.  He wrote about productivity in lines
of code:  the best programmers can solve a given problem in a tenth
the time.  But what if the problem isn&apos;t given? In programming, as
in many fields, the hard part isn&apos;t solving problems, but deciding
what problems to solve.  Imagination is hard to measure, but
in practice it dominates the kind of productivity that&apos;s measured
in lines of code.<br><br>Productivity varies in any field, but there are few in which it
varies so much.  The variation between programmers
is so great that it becomes a difference in kind.  I don&apos;t
think this is something intrinsic to programming, though.  In every field,
technology magnifies differences in productivity.  I think what&apos;s
happening in programming is just that we have a lot of technological
leverage.  But in every field the lever is getting longer, so the
variation we see is something that more and more fields will see
as time goes on.  And the success of companies, and countries, will
depend increasingly on how they deal with it.<br><br>If variation in productivity increases with technology, then the
contribution of the most productive individuals will not only be
disproportionately large, but will actually grow with time.  When
you reach the point where 90% of a group&apos;s output is created by 1%
of its members, you lose big if something (whether Viking raids,
or central planning) drags their productivity down to the average.<br><br>If we want to get the most out of them, we need to understand these
especially productive people.  What motivates them?  What do they
need to do their jobs?  How do you recognize them? How do you
get them to come and work for you?  And then of course there&apos;s the
question, how do you become one?<br><br><b>More than Money</b><br><br>I know a handful of super-hackers, so I sat down and thought about
what they have in common.  Their defining quality is probably that
they really love to program.  Ordinary programmers write code to pay
the bills.  Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun,
and which they&apos;re delighted to find people will pay them for.<br><br>Great programmers are sometimes said to be indifferent to money.
This isn&apos;t quite true.  It is true that all they really care about
is doing interesting work.  But if you make enough money, you get
to work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackers <i>are</i>
attracted by the idea of making really large amounts of money.
But as long as they still have to show up for work every day, they
care more about what they do there than how much they get paid for
it.<br><br>Economically, this is a fact of the greatest importance, because
it means you don&apos;t have to pay great hackers anything like what
they&apos;re worth.  A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times
as productive as an ordinary one, but he&apos;ll consider himself lucky
to get paid three times as much.  As I&apos;ll explain later, this is
partly because great hackers don&apos;t know how good they are.  But
it&apos;s also because money is not the main thing they want.<br><br>What do hackers want?  Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools.
In fact, that&apos;s an understatement.  Good hackers find it unbearable
to use bad tools.  They&apos;ll simply refuse to work on projects with
the wrong infrastructure.<br><br>At a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on our
bulletin board was an ad from IBM.  It was a picture of an AS400,
and the headline read, I think, &quot;hackers despise
it.&apos;&apos; [1]<br><br>When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you&apos;re
not just making a technical decision.  You&apos;re also making a social
decision, and this may be the more important of the two.  For
example, if your company wants to write some software, it might
seem a prudent choice to write it in Java.  But when you choose a
language, you&apos;re also choosing a community.  The programmers you&apos;ll
be able to hire to work on a Java project won&apos;t be as
<a href="pypar.html">smart</a> as the
ones you could get to work on a project written in Python.
And the quality of your hackers probably matters more than the
language you choose.  Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers
prefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relative
merits of those languages.<br><br>Business types prefer the most popular languages because they view
languages as standards. They don&apos;t want to bet the company on
Betamax.  The thing about languages, though, is that they&apos;re not
just standards.  If you have to move bits over a network, by all
means use TCP/IP.  But a programming language isn&apos;t just a format.
A programming language is a medium of expression.<br><br>I&apos;ve read that Java has just overtaken Cobol as the most popular
language.  As a standard, you couldn&apos;t wish for more.  But as a
medium of expression, you could do a lot better.  Of all the great
programmers I can think of, I know of only one who would voluntarily
program in Java.  And of all the great programmers I can think of
who don&apos;t work for Sun, on Java, I know of zero.<br><br>Great hackers also generally insist on using open source software.
Not just because it&apos;s better, but because it gives them more control.
Good hackers insist on control.  This is part of what makes them
good hackers:  when something&apos;s broken, they need to fix it.  You
want them to feel this way about the software they&apos;re writing for
you.  You shouldn&apos;t be surprised when they feel the same way about
the operating system.<br><br>A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new
startup he was involved with.  It sounded promising.  But the next
time I talked to him, he said they&apos;d decided to build their software
on Windows NT, and had just hired a very experienced NT developer
to be their chief technical officer.  When I heard this, I thought,
these guys are doomed.  One, the CTO couldn&apos;t be a first rate
hacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would have
had to use NT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn&apos;t imagine
a great hacker doing that; and two, even if he was good, he&apos;d have
a hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project had
to be built on NT. [2]<br><br><b>The Final Frontier</b><br><br>After software, the most important tool to a hacker is probably
his office.  Big companies think the function of office space is to express
rank.  But hackers use their offices for more than that: they
use their office as a place to think in.  And if you&apos;re a technology
company, their thoughts are your product.  So making hackers work
in a noisy, distracting environment is like having a paint factory
where the air is full of soot.<br><br>The cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles, and with
good reason.  All the hackers I know despise them.  The mere prospect
of being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from working on
hard problems.  If you want to get real work done in an office with
cubicles, you have two options: work at home, or come in early or
late or on a weekend, when no one else is there.  Don&apos;t companies
realize this is a sign that something is broken?  An office
environment is supposed to be something that <i>helps</i>
you work, not something you work despite.<br><br>Companies like Cisco are proud that everyone there has a cubicle,
even the CEO.  But they&apos;re not so advanced as they think; obviously
they still view office space as a badge of rank.  Note too that
Cisco is famous for doing very little product development in house.
They get new technology by buying the startups that created it-- where
presumably the hackers did have somewhere quiet to work.<br><br>One big company that understands what hackers need is Microsoft.
I once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of a
door.  Work for us, the premise was, and we&apos;ll give you a place to
work where you can actually get work done.   And you know, Microsoft
is remarkable among big companies in that they are able to develop
software in house.  Not well, perhaps, but well enough.<br><br>If companies want hackers to be productive, they should look at
what they do at home.  At home, hackers can arrange things themselves
so they can get the most done.  And when they work at home, hackers
don&apos;t work in noisy, open spaces; they work in rooms with doors.  They
work in cosy, neighborhoody places with people around and somewhere
to walk when they need to mull something over, instead of in glass
boxes set in acres of parking lots.  They have a sofa they can take
a nap on when they feel tired, instead of sitting in a coma at
their desk, pretending to work.  There&apos;s no crew of people with
vacuum cleaners that roars through every evening during the prime
hacking hours.  There are no meetings or, God forbid, corporate
retreats or team-building exercises.  And when you look at what
they&apos;re doing on that computer, you&apos;ll find it reinforces what I
said earlier about tools.  They may have to use Java and Windows
at work, but at home, where they can choose for themselves, you&apos;re
more likely to find them using Perl and Linux.<br><br>Indeed, these statistics about Cobol or Java being the most popular
language can be misleading.  What we ought to look at, if we want
to know what tools are best, is what hackers choose when they can
choose freely-- that is, in projects of their own.  When you ask
that question, you find that open source operating systems already
have a dominant market share, and the number one language is probably
Perl.<br><br><b>Interesting</b><br><br>Along with good tools, hackers want interesting projects.  What
makes a project interesting?  Well, obviously overtly sexy
applications like stealth planes or special effects software would
be interesting to work on.  But any application can be interesting
if it poses novel technical challenges.  So it&apos;s hard to predict
which problems hackers will like, because some become
interesting only when the people working on them discover a new
kind of solution.  Before ITA
(who wrote the software inside Orbitz),
the people working on airline fare searches probably thought it
was one of the most boring applications imaginable.  But ITA made
it interesting by 
<a href="carl.html">redefining</a> the problem in a more ambitious way.<br><br>I think the same thing happened at Google.  When Google was founded,
the conventional wisdom among the so-called portals was that search
was boring and unimportant.  But the guys at Google didn&apos;t think
search was boring, and that&apos;s why they do it so well.<br><br>This is an area where managers can make a difference.  Like a parent
saying to a child, I bet you can&apos;t clean up your whole room in
ten minutes, a good manager can sometimes redefine a problem as a
more interesting one.  Steve Jobs seems to be particularly good at
this, in part simply by having high standards.  There were a lot
of small, inexpensive computers before the Mac.  He redefined the
problem as: make one that&apos;s beautiful.  And that probably drove
the developers harder than any carrot or stick could.<br><br>They certainly delivered.  When the Mac first appeared, you didn&apos;t
even have to turn it on to know it would be good; you could tell
from the case.  A few weeks ago I was walking along the street in
Cambridge, and in someone&apos;s trash I saw what appeared to be a Mac
carrying case.  I looked inside, and there was a Mac SE.  I carried
it home and plugged it in, and it booted.  The happy Macintosh
face, and then the finder.  My God, it was so simple.  It was just
like ... Google.<br><br>Hackers like to work for people with high standards.  But it&apos;s not
enough just to be exacting.  You have to insist on the right things.
Which usually means that you have to be a hacker yourself.  I&apos;ve
seen occasional articles about how to manage programmers.  Really
there should be two articles: one about what to do if
you are yourself a programmer, and one about what to do if you&apos;re not.  And the 
second could probably be condensed into two words:  give up.<br><br>The problem is not so much the day to day management.  Really good
hackers are practically self-managing.  The problem is, if you&apos;re
not a hacker, you can&apos;t tell who the good hackers are.  A similar
problem explains why American cars are so ugly.  I call it the
<i>design paradox.</i>  You might think that you could make your products
beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them.  But if
you yourself don&apos;t have good <a href="taste.html">taste</a>, 
how are you going to recognize
a good designer?  By definition you can&apos;t tell from his portfolio.
And you can&apos;t go by the awards he&apos;s won or the jobs he&apos;s had,
because in design, as in most fields, those tend to be driven by
fashion and schmoozing, with actual ability a distant third.
There&apos;s no way around it:  you can&apos;t manage a process intended to
produce beautiful things without knowing what beautiful is.  American
cars are ugly because American car companies are run by people with
bad taste.<br><br>Many people in this country think of taste as something elusive,
or even frivolous.  It is neither.  To drive design, a manager must
be the most demanding user of a company&apos;s products.  And if you
have really good taste, you can, as Steve Jobs does, make satisfying
you the kind of problem that good people like to work on.<br><br><b>Nasty Little Problems</b><br><br>It&apos;s pretty easy to say what kinds of problems are not interesting:
those where instead of solving a few big, clear, problems, you have
to solve a lot of nasty little ones.  One of the worst kinds of
projects is writing an interface to a piece of software that&apos;s
full of bugs.  Another is when you have to customize
something for an individual client&apos;s complex and ill-defined needs.
To hackers these kinds of projects are the death of a thousand
cuts.<br><br>The distinguishing feature of nasty little problems is that you
don&apos;t learn anything from them.   Writing a compiler is interesting
because it teaches you what a compiler is.  But writing an interface
to a buggy piece of software doesn&apos;t teach you anything, because the
bugs are random.  [3] So it&apos;s not just fastidiousness that makes good
hackers avoid nasty little problems.  It&apos;s more a question of
self-preservation.  Working on nasty little problems makes you
stupid.  Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid
cheeseburgers.<br><br>Of course some problems inherently have this character.  And because
of supply and demand, they pay especially well.  So a company that
found a way to get great hackers to work on tedious problems would
be very successful.  How would you do it?<br><br>One place this happens is in startups.  At our startup we had 
Robert Morris working as a system administrator.  That&apos;s like having the
Rolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah.  You can&apos;t hire that kind of
talent.  But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies
of which they&apos;re the founders.  [4]<br><br>Bigger companies solve the problem by partitioning the company.
They get smart people to work for them by establishing a separate
R&amp;D department where employees don&apos;t have to work directly on
customers&apos; nasty little problems. [5] In this model, the research
department functions like a mine. They produce new ideas; maybe
the rest of the company will be able to use them.<br><br>You may not have to go to this extreme.  
<a href="progbot.html">Bottom-up programming</a>
suggests another way to partition the company: have the smart people
work as toolmakers.  If your company makes software to do x, have
one group that builds tools for writing software of that type, and
another that uses these tools to write the applications.  This way
you might be able to get smart people to write 99% of your code,
but still keep them almost as insulated from users as they would
be in a traditional research department.  The toolmakers would have
users, but they&apos;d only be the company&apos;s own developers.  [6]<br><br>If Microsoft used this approach, their software wouldn&apos;t be so full
of security holes, because the less smart people writing the actual
applications wouldn&apos;t be doing low-level stuff like allocating
memory.  Instead of writing Word directly in C, they&apos;d be plugging
together big Lego blocks of Word-language.  (Duplo, I believe, is
the technical term.)<br><br><b>Clumping</b><br><br>Along with interesting problems, what good hackers like is other
good hackers.  Great hackers tend to clump together-- sometimes
spectacularly so, as at Xerox Parc.   So you won&apos;t attract good
hackers in linear proportion to how good an environment you create
for them.  The tendency to clump means it&apos;s more like the square
of the environment.  So it&apos;s winner take all.  At any given time,
there are only about ten or twenty places where hackers most want to
work, and if you aren&apos;t one of them, you won&apos;t just have fewer
great hackers, you&apos;ll have zero.<br><br>Having great hackers is not, by itself, enough to make a company
successful.  It works well for Google and ITA, which are two of
the hot spots right now, but it didn&apos;t help Thinking Machines or
Xerox.  Sun had a good run for a while, but their business model
is a down elevator.  In that situation, even the best hackers can&apos;t
save you.<br><br>I think, though, that all other things being equal, a company that
can attract great hackers will have a huge advantage.  There are
people who would disagree with this.  When we were making the rounds
of venture capital firms in the 1990s, several told us that software
companies didn&apos;t win by writing great software, but through brand,
and dominating channels, and doing the right deals.<br><br>They really seemed to believe this, and I think I know why.  I
think what a lot of VCs are looking for, at least unconsciously,
is the next Microsoft.  And of course if Microsoft is your model,
you shouldn&apos;t be looking for companies that hope to win by writing
great software.  But VCs are mistaken to look for the next Microsoft,
because no startup can be the next Microsoft unless some other
company is prepared to bend over at just the right moment and be
the next IBM.<br><br>It&apos;s a mistake to use Microsoft as a model, because their whole
culture derives from that one lucky break.  Microsoft is a bad data
point.  If you throw them out, you find that good products do tend
to win in the market.  What VCs should be looking for is the next
Apple, or the next Google.<br><br>I think Bill Gates knows this.  What worries him about Google is
not the power of their brand, but the fact that they have
better hackers. [7]<br><br>
<b>Recognition</b><br><br>So who are the great hackers?  How do you know when you meet one?
That turns out to be very hard.  Even hackers can&apos;t tell.  I&apos;m
pretty sure now that my friend Trevor Blackwell is a great hacker.
You may have read on Slashdot how he made his 
<a href="http://www.tlb.org/scooter.html">own Segway</a>.  The
remarkable thing about this project was that he wrote all the
software in one day (in Python, incidentally).<br><br>For Trevor, that&apos;s
par for the course.  But when I first met him, I thought he was a
complete idiot.  He was standing in Robert Morris&apos;s office babbling
at him about something or other, and I remember standing behind
him making frantic gestures at Robert to shoo this nut out of his
office so we could go to lunch.  Robert says he misjudged Trevor
at first too.  Apparently when Robert first met him, Trevor had
just begun a new scheme that involved writing down everything about
every aspect of his life on a stack of index cards, which he carried
with him everywhere.  He&apos;d also just arrived from Canada, and had
a strong Canadian accent and a mullet.<br><br>The problem is compounded by the fact that hackers, despite their
reputation for social obliviousness, sometimes put a good deal of
effort into seeming smart.  When I was in grad school I used to
hang around the MIT AI Lab occasionally. It was kind of intimidating
at first.  Everyone there spoke so fast.  But after a while I
learned the trick of speaking fast.  You don&apos;t have to think any
faster; just use twice as many words to say everything.  <!-- At the
time I used to consult on the side, and when I was talking to
clients I would sometimes put on this MIT manner deliberately to
overawe them, especially during demos of software I'd supposedly
been working on for weeks but had in fact written the night before. --><br><br>With this amount of noise in the signal, it&apos;s hard to tell good
hackers when you meet them.  I can&apos;t tell, even now.  You also
can&apos;t tell from their resumes.  It seems like the only way to judge
a hacker is to work with him on something.<br><br>And this is the reason that high-tech areas 
only happen around universities.  The active ingredient
here is not so much the professors as the students.  Startups grow up
around universities because universities bring together promising young
people and make them work on the same projects.  The
smart ones learn who the other smart ones are, and together
they cook up new projects of their own.<br><br>Because you can&apos;t tell a great hacker except by working with him,
hackers themselves can&apos;t tell how good they are.  This is true to
a degree in most fields.  I&apos;ve found that people who
are great at something are not so much convinced of their own
greatness as mystified at why everyone else seems so incompetent.
<!-- The people I've met who do great work rarely think that they're
doing great work.  They generally feel that they're stupid and
lazy, that their brain only works properly one day out of ten, and
that it's only a matter of time until they're found out. --><br><br>But it&apos;s particularly hard for hackers to know how good they are,
because it&apos;s hard to compare their work.  This is easier in most
other fields.  In the hundred meters, you know in 10 seconds who&apos;s
fastest.  Even in math there seems to be a general consensus about
which problems are hard to solve, and what constitutes a good
solution.  But hacking is like writing.  Who can say which of two
novels is better?  Certainly not the authors.<br><br>With hackers, at least, other hackers can tell.  That&apos;s because,
unlike novelists, hackers collaborate on projects.  When you get
to hit a few difficult problems over the net at someone, you learn
pretty quickly how hard they hit them back.  But hackers can&apos;t
watch themselves at work.  So if you ask a great hacker how good
he is, he&apos;s almost certain to reply, I don&apos;t know.  He&apos;s not just
being modest.  He really doesn&apos;t know.<br><br>And none of us know, except about people we&apos;ve actually worked
with.  Which puts us in a weird situation: we don&apos;t know who our
heroes should be.  The hackers who become famous tend to become
famous by random accidents of PR.  Occasionally I need to give an
example of a great hacker, and I never know who to use.  The first
names that come to mind always tend to be people I know personally,
but it seems lame to use them.  So, I think, maybe I should say
Richard Stallman, or Linus Torvalds, or Alan Kay, or someone famous
like that.  But I have no idea if these guys are great hackers.
I&apos;ve never worked with them on anything.<br><br>If there is a Michael Jordan of hacking, no one knows, including
him.<br><br><b>Cultivation</b><br><br>Finally, the question the hackers have all been wondering about:
how do you become a great hacker?  I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s possible
to make yourself into one.  But it&apos;s certainly possible to do things
that make you stupid, and if you can make yourself stupid, you
can probably make yourself smart too.<br><br>The key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like.
When I think about the great hackers I know, one thing they have
in common is the extreme 
<a href="procrastination.html">difficulty</a> of making them work 
on anything they
don&apos;t want to.  I don&apos;t know if this is cause or effect; it may be
both.<br><br>To do something well you have to <a href="love.html">love</a> it.  
So to the extent you
can preserve hacking as something you love, you&apos;re likely to do it
well.  Try to keep the sense of wonder you had about programming at
age 14.  If you&apos;re worried that your current job is rotting your
brain, it probably is.<br><br>The best hackers tend to be smart, of course, but that&apos;s true in
a lot of fields.  Is there some quality that&apos;s unique to hackers?
I asked some friends, and the number one thing they mentioned was
curiosity.  
I&apos;d always supposed that all smart people were curious--
that curiosity was simply the first derivative of knowledge.  But
apparently hackers are particularly curious, especially about how
things work.  That makes sense, because programs are in effect
giant descriptions of how things work.<br><br>Several friends mentioned hackers&apos; ability to concentrate-- their
ability, as one put it, to &quot;tune out everything outside their own
heads.&apos;&apos;  I&apos;ve certainly noticed this.  And I&apos;ve heard several 
hackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can&apos;t program at
all.   So maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus.
Perhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into their
head, so that when they look at a line of code, they see not just
that line but the whole program around it.  John McPhee
wrote that Bill Bradley&apos;s success as a basketball player was due
partly to his extraordinary peripheral vision.  &quot;Perfect&apos;&apos; eyesight
means about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision.  Bill Bradley
had 70; he could see the basket when he was looking at the floor.
Maybe great hackers have some similar inborn ability.  (I cheat by
using a very <a href="power.html">dense</a> language, 
which shrinks the court.)<br><br>This could explain the disconnect over cubicles.  Maybe the people
in charge of facilities, not having any concentration to shatter,
have no idea that working in a cubicle feels to a hacker like having
one&apos;s brain in a blender.  (Whereas Bill, if the rumors of autism
are true, knows all too well.)<br><br>One difference I&apos;ve noticed between great hackers and smart people
in general is that hackers are more 
<a href="say.html">politically incorrect</a>.  To the
extent there is a secret handshake among good hackers, it&apos;s when they
know one another well enough to express opinions that would get
them stoned to death by the general public.  And I can see why
political incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming.
Programs are very complex and, at least in the hands of good
programmers, very fluid.  In such situations it&apos;s helpful to have
a habit of questioning assumptions.<br><br>Can you cultivate these qualities?  I don&apos;t know.  But you can at
least not repress them.  So here is my best shot at a recipe.  If
it is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do
it may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have
to work on boring projects (unless your family will starve otherwise),
and in return, you&apos;ll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job.
All the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal, though
perhaps none of them had any choice in the matter.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br><!--[h] The most productive individuals at different stages of technology
are not necessarily the same people.  Energy and determination are
always important, but physical strength, for example, decreases in
importance as technology increases.<br><br>In early modern Europe, the most important quality may have been
organization.  The kind of brilliance that distinguished Isaac
Newton had little practical effect.  It would have more now.-->
[1] In fairness, I have to say that IBM makes decent hardware.  I
wrote this on an IBM laptop.<br><br>[2] They did turn out to be doomed.  They shut down a few months
later.<br><br>[3] I think this is what people mean when they talk
about the &quot;meaning of life.&quot;  On the face of it, this seems an 
odd idea.  Life isn&apos;t an expression; how could it have meaning?
But it can have a quality that feels a lot like meaning.  In a project
like a compiler, you have to solve a lot of problems, but the problems
all fall into a pattern, as in a signal.  Whereas when the problems
you have to solve are random, they seem like noise.
<!-- What's the meaning of life?  A metaphor.--><br><br>[4] Einstein at one point worked designing refrigerators. (He had equity.)<br><br>[5] It&apos;s hard to say exactly what constitutes research in the
computer world, but as a first approximation, it&apos;s software that
doesn&apos;t have users.<br><br>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s publication that makes the best hackers want to work
in research departments.  I think it&apos;s mainly not having to have a
three hour meeting with a product manager about problems integrating
the Korean version of Word 13.27 with the talking paperclip.<br><br>[6] Something similar has been happening for a long time in the
construction industry. When you had a house built a couple hundred
years ago, the local builders built everything in it.  But increasingly
what builders do is assemble components designed and manufactured
by someone else.  This has, like the arrival of desktop publishing,
given people the freedom to experiment in disastrous ways, but it
is certainly more efficient.<br><br>[7] Google is much more dangerous to Microsoft than Netscape was.
Probably more dangerous than any other company has ever been.  Not
least because they&apos;re determined to fight.  On their job listing
page, they say that one of their &quot;core values&apos;&apos; is &quot;Don&apos;t be evil.&apos;&apos;
From a company selling soybean oil or mining equipment, such a

people: that you could get smarter programmers to work on
a Python project than you could to work on a Java project.<br><br>I didn&apos;t mean by this that Java programmers are dumb.  I
meant that Python programmers are smart. It&apos;s a lot of
work to learn a new programming language.  And people don&apos;t
learn Python because it will get them a job; they learn it
because they genuinely like to program and aren&apos;t satisfied with the languages they
already know.<br><br>Which makes them exactly the kind of programmers
companies should want to hire.  Hence what, for lack of a better
name, I&apos;ll call the Python paradox: if a company chooses to write
its software in a comparatively esoteric language, they&apos;ll be able 
to hire better programmers, because they&apos;ll attract only those
who cared enough to learn it.  And for 
programmers the paradox is even more pronounced: the language
to learn, if you want to get a good job, is a language that
people don&apos;t learn merely to get a job.<br><br>Only a few companies have been smart enough to realize this 
so far.  But there is a kind of selection going on here too: they&apos;re 
exactly the companies programmers would
most like to work for.  Google, for example.  When they     
advertise Java programming jobs, they also want Python experience.<br><br>A friend of mine who knows nearly all the widely used languages
uses Python for most of his projects.  He says the main reason
is that he likes the way source code looks.  That may seem
a frivolous reason to choose one language over another.
But it is not so frivolous as it sounds: when you program,
you spend more time reading code than writing it.
You push blobs of source code around the way a sculptor does
blobs of clay.  So a language that makes source code ugly is
maddening to an exacting programmer, as clay full of lumps
would be to a sculptor.<br><br>At the mention of ugly source code, people will of course think
of Perl.  But the superficial ugliness of Perl is not the sort
I mean.  Real ugliness is not harsh-looking
syntax, but having to build programs out of the wrong
concepts.  Perl may look like a cartoon character swearing,
but there are 
<a href="icad.html">cases</a> where it surpasses Python conceptually.<br><br>So far, anyway. Both languages are of course 
<a href="hundred.html">moving</a> targets.  But they
share, along with Ruby (and Icon, and Joy, and J, and Lisp,
and Smalltalk) the fact that
they&apos;re created by, and used by, people who really care about
programming.   And those tend to be the ones who do it well.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img

Topic sentence, introductory paragraph,
supporting paragraphs, conclusion.  The conclusion being,
say, that Ahab in <i>Moby Dick</i> was a Christ-like figure.<br><br>Oy.  So I&apos;m going to try to give the other side of the
story: what an essay really is, and how you write one.
Or at least, how I write one.<br><br><b>Mods</b><br><br>The most obvious difference between real essays and
the things one has to write in school is that real
essays are not exclusively about English literature.
Certainly schools should teach students how to
write.  But due to a series of historical accidents
the teaching of
writing has gotten mixed together with the study
of literature.  And so all over the country students are
writing not about how a baseball team with a small budget
might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in
fashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about
symbolism in Dickens.<br><br>With the result that writing is made to seem boring and
pointless.  Who cares about symbolism in Dickens?
Dickens himself would be more interested in an essay
about color or baseball.<br><br>How did things get this way?  To answer that we have to go back
almost a thousand years.  Around 1100, Europe at last began to
catch its breath after centuries of chaos, and once they
had the luxury of curiosity they rediscovered
what we call &quot;the classics.&quot;  The effect was rather as if
we were visited by beings from another solar system.
These earlier civilizations were so much more sophisticated
that for the next several centuries the main work of
European scholars, in almost every field, was to assimilate
what they knew.<br><br>During this period the study of ancient texts acquired great
prestige.  It seemed the essence of what scholars did.  As
European scholarship gained momentum it became less and less important;
by 1350
someone who wanted to learn about science could find better
teachers than Aristotle in his own era. [1]
But schools change slower than scholarship.  In the
19th century the study of ancient texts was still the backbone
of the curriculum.<br><br>The time was then ripe for the question: if the study of
ancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not modern
texts?  The answer, of course, is that the original raison d&apos;etre
of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaeology that
does not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors.
But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer.
The archaeological work being mostly done, it implied that
those studying the classics were, if not wasting their
time, at least working on problems of minor importance.<br><br>And so began the study of modern literature.  There was a good
deal of resistance at first.
The first courses in English literature
seem to have been offered by the newer colleges, particularly
American ones.  Dartmouth, the University of Vermont, Amherst,
and University College, London
taught English literature in the 1820s.
<!--The newly founded University
of London had the first professor of English language and literature
in 1828, and Lafayette College the second in 1857.-->
But Harvard didn&apos;t have a professor of English literature until
1876, and Oxford not till 1885. (Oxford had a chair of Chinese before
it had one of English.) [2]<br><br>What tipped the scales, at least in the US, seems to have
been the idea that professors should do research as well
as teach.  This idea (along with the PhD, the department, and
indeed the whole concept of the modern university) was imported
from Germany in the late 19th century. Beginning at
Johns Hopkins in 1876, the new model spread rapidly.<br><br>Writing was one of the casualties.  Colleges had long taught
English composition.  But how do you do research on composition?
The professors who taught math could be required to do original
math, the professors who taught history could be required to
write scholarly articles about history, but what about the  
professors who taught rhetoric or composition?  What should they
do research on?  The closest thing seemed to be English literature. [3]<br><br>And so in the late 19th century the teaching of writing was inherited
by English professors.  This had two drawbacks:
(a) an expert on literature need not himself be a good writer,
any more than an art historian has to be a good painter, and (b)
the subject of writing now tends to be literature, since that&apos;s
what the professor is interested in.<br><br>High schools imitate universities.  The seeds of our miserable
high school experiences were sown in 1892, when
the National Education Association
&quot;formally recommended that literature
and composition be unified in the high school course.&quot; [4]
The &apos;riting component of the 3 Rs then morphed into English,
with the bizarre consequence that high school students now
had to write about English literature-- to write, without
even realizing it, imitations of whatever
English professors had been publishing in their journals a   
few decades before.<br><br>It&apos;s no wonder if this seems to the
student a pointless exercise, because we&apos;re now three steps
removed from real work: the students are imitating English
professors, who are imitating classical scholars, who are
merely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what
was, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.<br><br><b>No Defense</b><br><br>The other big difference between a real essay and the things
they make you write in school is that a real essay doesn&apos;t
take a position and then defend it.  That principle,
like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature,
turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long
forgotten origins.<br><br>It&apos;s often mistakenly believed that
medieval universities were mostly seminaries.  In fact they
were more law schools.  And at least in our tradition
lawyers are advocates, trained to take
either side of an argument and make as good a case for it
as they can.
Whether cause or effect, this spirit pervaded
early universities.  The study of rhetoric, the art of arguing
persuasively, was a third of the undergraduate curriculum. [5]
And after the lecture the most common form
of discussion was the disputation.  This is at least
nominally preserved in our present-day thesis defense:
most people treat the words thesis
and dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least,
a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation was
the argument by which one defended it.<br><br>Defending a position may be a necessary evil in a
legal dispute, but it&apos;s not the best way to get at the truth,
as I think lawyers would be the first to admit.  It&apos;s not
just that you miss subtleties this way.
The real problem is that you can&apos;t change the question.<br><br>And yet this principle is built into the very structure of
the things they teach you to write in high school.  The topic  
sentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the supporting
paragraphs the blows you strike in the conflict, and the
conclusion-- uh, what is the conclusion?  I was never sure
about that in high school.  It seemed as if we were just
supposed to restate what we said in the first paragraph,
but in different enough words that no one could tell.
Why bother?
But when you understand the origins
of this sort of &quot;essay,&quot; you can see where the
conclusion comes from.  It&apos;s the concluding remarks to the   
jury.<br><br>Good writing should be convincing, certainly, but it
should be convincing because you got the right answers,
not because you did a good job of arguing.  When I give a 
draft of an essay to friends, there are two things
I want to know: which parts bore them, and which seem   
unconvincing.  The boring bits can usually be fixed by   
cutting.  But I don&apos;t try to fix the unconvincing bits by
arguing more cleverly.  I need to talk the matter over.<br><br>At the very least I must have explained something badly.  In
that case, in the course of the conversation I&apos;ll be forced
to come up a with a clearer explanation, which I can just
incorporate in the essay.  More often than not I have
to change what I was saying as well.
But the aim is never to be convincing per se.
As the reader gets smarter, convincing and true become identical,
so if I can convince smart readers I must be near the truth.<br><br>The sort of writing that attempts to persuade may be
a valid (or at least inevitable) form, but it&apos;s historically
inaccurate to call it an essay.  An essay is 
something else.<br><br><b>Trying</b><br><br>To understand what a real essay is, we have to
reach back into history again, though this time not so far.
To Michel de Montaigne, who in 1580 published a book of
what he called &quot;essais.&quot; He was
doing something quite different from what lawyers do, and
the difference is embodied in the name.  <i>Essayer</i> is the French
verb meaning &quot;to try&quot;
and an <i>essai</i> is an attempt.  An essay is something you
write to try to figure something out.<br><br>Figure out what?  You don&apos;t know yet.  And so you can&apos;t begin with a
thesis, because you don&apos;t have one, and may never have
one.  An essay doesn&apos;t begin with a statement, but with a
question.  In a real essay, you don&apos;t take a position and
defend it.  You notice a door that&apos;s ajar, and you open it and
walk in to see what&apos;s inside.<br><br>If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you need
to write anything, though?  Why not just sit and think?  Well,
there precisely is Montaigne&apos;s great discovery.  Expressing    
ideas helps to form them.  Indeed, helps is far too weak a
word.  Most of what ends up in my essays I only
thought of when I sat down to write them.  That&apos;s why I   
write them.<br><br>In the things you write in school you are, in theory,
merely explaining yourself to the reader.
In a real essay you&apos;re writing for yourself.
You&apos;re thinking out loud.<br><br>But not quite.
Just as inviting people over forces you to
clean up your apartment, writing something that
other people will read forces you to think well.  So it
does matter to have an audience.  The things I&apos;ve written
just for myself are no good.
They tend to peter out.  When I run into
difficulties, I find I conclude with a few vague
questions and then drift off to get a cup of tea.<br><br>Many published essays peter out in the same way.
Particularly the sort written by the staff writers 
of newsmagazines.  Outside writers tend to supply
editorials of the defend-a-position variety, which
make a beeline toward a rousing (and
foreordained) conclusion.   But the staff writers feel
obliged to write something &quot;balanced.&quot;
Since they&apos;re writing for a popular magazine, they start with the
most radioactively controversial questions, from which-- because
they&apos;re writing for a popular magazine-- they
then proceed to recoil in terror.
Abortion, for or against?
This group says one thing.  That group says
another.  One thing is certain: the question is a
complex one.  (But don&apos;t get mad at us.  We didn&apos;t
draw any conclusions.)<br><br><b>The River</b><br><br>Questions aren&apos;t enough.  An essay has to come up with answers.
They don&apos;t always, of course.  Sometimes you start with a
promising question and get nowhere.  But those you don&apos;t   
publish.  Those are like experiments that get inconclusive
results.   An essay you publish ought to tell the reader       
something he didn&apos;t already know.<br><br>But <i>what</i> you tell him doesn&apos;t matter, so long as    
it&apos;s interesting.  I&apos;m sometimes accused of meandering.
In defend-a-position writing that would be a flaw.
There you&apos;re not concerned with truth.  You already
know where you&apos;re going, and you want to go straight there,
blustering through obstacles, and hand-waving
your way across swampy ground.  But that&apos;s not what
you&apos;re trying to do in an essay.  An essay is supposed to
be a search for truth.  It would be suspicious if it didn&apos;t
meander.<br><br>The Meander (aka Menderes) is a river in Turkey.
As you might expect, it winds all over the place.
But it doesn&apos;t do this out of frivolity.
The path it has discovered is the most
economical route to the sea. [6]<br><br>The river&apos;s algorithm is simple.  At each step, flow down.
For the essayist this translates to: flow interesting.   
Of all the places to go next, choose the most interesting.
One can&apos;t have quite as little foresight as a river.  I always
know generally what I want to write about.
But not the
specific conclusions I want to reach; from paragraph to
paragraph I let the ideas take their course.<br><br>This doesn&apos;t always work.  Sometimes, like a river,
one runs up against a wall.  Then I do the same thing the river does:
backtrack.  At one point in this essay
I found that after following a certain thread I ran out
of ideas.  I had to go back seven paragraphs and start over
in another direction.<br><br>Fundamentally an essay is a train of thought-- but a cleaned-up
train of thought, as dialogue is cleaned-up conversation.
Real thought, like real conversation, is full of false starts.
It would be exhausting to read.  You need to 
cut and fill to
emphasize the central thread, like an
illustrator inking over a pencil drawing.  But don&apos;t
change so much that you lose the spontaneity of the original.<br><br>Err on the side of the river.  An essay is not a reference
work.  It&apos;s not something you read looking for a specific
answer, and feel cheated if you don&apos;t find it.  I&apos;d much
rather read an essay that went off in an unexpected but
interesting direction than one that plodded dutifully along
a prescribed course.<br><br><b>Surprise</b><br><br>So what&apos;s interesting?  For me, interesting means surprise.
Interfaces, as Geoffrey James has said, should follow the principle of
least astonishment.   A button that looks like it will make a
machine stop should make it stop, not speed up.  Essays    
should do the opposite.  Essays should aim for maximum
surprise.<br><br>I was afraid of flying for a long time and could only travel
vicariously.  When friends came back from faraway places,
it wasn&apos;t just out of politeness that I asked
what they saw.  I really wanted to know.  And I found
the best way to get information out of them was to ask
what surprised them.  How was the place different from what
they expected?  This is an extremely useful question.
You can ask it of the most unobservant people, and it will 
extract information they didn&apos;t even know they were
recording.<br><br>Surprises are things that you not only didn&apos;t know, but that
contradict things you
thought you knew.  And so they&apos;re the most valuable sort of
fact you can get.  They&apos;re like a food that&apos;s not merely
healthy, but counteracts the unhealthy effects of things
you&apos;ve already eaten.<br><br>How do you find surprises?  Well, therein lies half
the work of essay writing.  (The other half is expressing
yourself well.)   The trick is to use yourself as a
proxy for the reader.  You should only write about things
you&apos;ve thought about a lot.  And anything you come across
that surprises you, who&apos;ve thought about the topic a lot,
will probably surprise most readers.<br><br>For example, in a recent 
<a href="gh.html">essay</a> I pointed out that because
you can only judge computer programmers by working with
them, no one knows who the best programmers are overall.
I didn&apos;t realize this when I began
that essay, and even now I find it kind of weird.  That&apos;s
what you&apos;re looking for.<br><br>So if you want to write essays, you need two ingredients:
a few topics you&apos;ve thought about a lot, and
some ability to ferret out the unexpected.<br><br>What should you think about?  My guess is that it
doesn&apos;t matter-- that anything can be interesting if you get deeply
enough into it.  One possible exception might be things
that have deliberately had all the variation sucked out of them,
like working in fast food.  In retrospect, was there
anything interesting about working at Baskin-Robbins?
Well, it was interesting how important color was
to the customers.  Kids a certain age would point into
the case and say that they wanted yellow.  Did they want 
French Vanilla or Lemon?  They would just look at you   
blankly.  They wanted yellow.  And then there was the  
mystery of why the perennial favorite Pralines &apos;n&apos; Cream   
was so appealing.  (I think now it was the salt.)
<!--And the mystery of why Passion Fruit tasted so awful.
People would order it because of the name, and were always
disappointed.-->
And the difference in the way fathers and
mothers bought ice cream for their kids: the fathers
like benevolent kings bestowing largesse, the mothers
harried, giving in to pressure.
So, yes, there does seem to be some material even in
fast food.<br><br>I didn&apos;t notice those things at the time, though.  At sixteen
I was about as observant as a lump of rock.  I can see more now in
the fragments of memory I preserve of that age than I could see
at the time from having it all happening live, right in front of me.<br><br><b>Observation</b><br><br>So the ability to ferret out the unexpected must not merely be an
inborn one.  It must be something you can learn.
How do you learn it?<br><br>To some extent it&apos;s like learning history.
When you first read
history, it&apos;s just a whirl of names
and dates.  
Nothing seems to stick.  But the more you learn, the more hooks you have
for new facts to stick onto-- which means
you accumulate knowledge at what&apos;s colloquially called an
exponential rate.  Once you
remember that Normans conquered
England in 1066, it will catch your attention when you hear
that other Normans conquered southern Italy at about the same time.
Which will make you wonder about Normandy, and take note
when a third book mentions that Normans
were not, like most of what is now
called France, tribes that flowed in as the Roman empire collapsed,
but Vikings (norman = north man) who arrived
four centuries later in 911.  Which makes
it easier to remember that Dublin was also established by
Vikings in the 840s.  Etc, etc squared.<br><br>Collecting surprises is a similar process.
The more anomalies you&apos;ve seen, the more easily you&apos;ll notice
new ones.   Which means, oddly enough, that as you grow older,
life should become more and more surprising.  When I was a
kid, I used to think adults had it all figured out.
I had it backwards.  Kids are the ones who have it all figured  
out.  They&apos;re just mistaken.<br><br>When it comes to surprises, the rich get richer.  But
(as with wealth) there
may be habits of mind that will help the process along.  It&apos;s
good to have a habit of asking questions, especially questions
beginning with Why.
But not in the random way that three year
olds ask why.  There are an infinite number of questions.
How do you find the fruitful ones?<br><br>I find it especially
useful to ask why about things that seem wrong.
For example, why should there be a connection between
humor and misfortune?  Why do we find it funny when a
character, even one we like, slips on a banana peel?
There&apos;s a whole essay&apos;s worth of surprises there for sure.<br><br>If you want to notice things that seem wrong, you&apos;ll find a
degree of skepticism helpful.  I take it as an axiom
that we&apos;re only achieving 1% of what we could.
This helps counteract the rule that gets beaten into our
heads as children: that things are the way they are because
that is how things have to be.
For example, everyone I&apos;ve talked to while writing this essay  
felt the same about
English classes-- that the whole process seemed pointless.
But none of us had the balls at the time to hypothesize that
it was, in fact, all a mistake.
We all thought there was just something we weren&apos;t getting.<br><br>I have a hunch you want to pay attention not just to things
that seem wrong, but things that seem wrong in a humorous way.  
I&apos;m always pleased when I see someone laugh as they
read a draft of an essay.  But why should I be?  I&apos;m aiming
for good ideas.  Why should good ideas be funny?
The connection may be surprise.
Surprises make us laugh, and surprises are what
one wants to deliver.<br><br>I write down things that surprise me in notebooks.  I never
actually get around to reading them and using
what I&apos;ve written, but I do tend to
reproduce the same thoughts later.  So the main value
of notebooks may be what writing things down leaves in your
head.<br><br>People trying to be cool will find themselves at a disadvantage
when collecting surprises.  To be surprised is to be mistaken.
And the essence of cool, as any fourteen year old could tell
you, is <i>nil admirari.</i>  When you&apos;re mistaken, don&apos;t
dwell on it; just act like nothing&apos;s wrong and maybe no one
will notice.<br><br>One of the keys to coolness is to avoid situations where
inexperience may make you look foolish. 
If you want to find surprises you should do the opposite.
Study lots of different things,
because some of the most interesting surprises are unexpected
connections between different fields.  For example, 
jam, bacon, pickles, and cheese, which are among the most pleasing
of foods, were all originally intended as methods of preservation.
And so were books and paintings.<br><br>Whatever you study, include history-- but social and economic
history, not political history.  History seems to me so important
that it&apos;s misleading to treat it as a mere field of study.
Another way to describe it is <i>all the data we have so far.</i><br><br>Among other things, studying history gives one confidence that
there are good ideas waiting to be discovered right under our noses.
Swords evolved during the Bronze Age out of daggers, which
(like their flint predecessors) had a hilt separate from the
blade.  Because swords are longer
the hilts kept breaking off.  But it took five hundred years
before someone thought of casting hilt and blade as one
piece.<br><br><b>Disobedience</b><br><br>Above all, make a habit of paying
attention to things you&apos;re not supposed to, either because 
they&apos;re &quot;<a href="say.html">inappropriate</a>,&quot; 
or not important, or not what you&apos;re
supposed to be working on.  If you&apos;re curious about something,
trust your instincts.
Follow the threads that attract your
attention.  If there&apos;s something you&apos;re really interested
in, you&apos;ll find they have an uncanny way of leading back to
it anyway, just as the conversation of people who are especially
proud of something always tends to lead back to it.<br><br>For example, I&apos;ve always been fascinated by comb-overs, especially
the extreme sort that
make a man look as if he&apos;s wearing a beret made of his own hair.
Surely this is a lowly sort of thing to be interested in-- the
sort of superficial quizzing
best left to teenage girls.  And yet there is something underneath.
The key question, I realized, is how does the comber-over not
see how odd he looks?
And the answer is that he got to look that way <i>incrementally.</i>
What began as combing his hair a little carefully over a
thin patch has gradually, over 20 years, grown into a monstrosity.
Gradualness is very powerful.  And that power can be
used for constructive purposes too: just as you can trick
yourself into looking like a freak, you can trick yourself into
creating something so grand that you would never have dared to
<i>plan</i> such a thing.  Indeed, this is just how most good
software gets created.  You start by writing a stripped-down
kernel (how hard can it be?) and gradually it grows
into a complete operating system.  Hence the next leap: could
you do the same thing in painting, or in a novel?<br><br>See what you can extract from a frivolous question?
If there&apos;s one piece of advice I would give about writing essays,
it would be: don&apos;t do as you&apos;re told.
Don&apos;t believe what you&apos;re supposed to.
Don&apos;t write the
essay readers expect; one learns nothing from
what one expects.
And
don&apos;t write the way they taught you to in school.<br><br>The most important sort of disobedience is to write
essays at all.  Fortunately, this sort of disobedience shows
signs of becoming 
<a href="http://www.ojr.org/ojr/glaser/1056050270.php">rampant</a>. 
It used to be that only a tiny
number of officially approved writers were allowed to
write essays.  Magazines published few of them, and judged
them less by what they said than who wrote them;
a magazine might publish a story by an
unknown writer if it was good enough, but if they published
an essay on x it had to be by someone who was at least
forty and whose job title had x in it.  Which is a problem,
because there are a lot of things insiders can&apos;t say precisely
because they&apos;re insiders.<br><br>The Internet is changing that.
Anyone can publish an essay on the Web, and it gets judged, as any
writing should, by what it says, not who wrote it.
Who are you to write about x?  You are whatever you wrote.<br><br>Popular magazines made the period between the spread
of literacy and the arrival of TV the golden age of the
short story.
The Web may well make this the golden age of the essay.
And that&apos;s certainly not something I realized when
I started writing this.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] I&apos;m thinking of Oresme (c. 1323-82).  But it&apos;s hard to pick
a date, because there was a sudden drop-off in scholarship
just as Europeans finished assimilating classical science.

scientific progress matches the population curve.<br><br>[2] Parker, William R. &quot;Where Do College English Departments

complete waste of time.  Blogging sounded like a long-play version 
of netnews.  But I was mistaken; people care more about something
that stays on their site, and the Web supplies a filter that's  
missing in newsgroups.

because I worked at Yahoo during 1998 and 1999.  One day,
when the stock was trading around $200, I sat down and calculated
what I thought the price should be. The 
answer I got was $12.  I went to
the next cubicle and told my friend Trevor.  &quot;Twelve!&quot; he said.
He tried to sound indignant, but he didn&apos;t quite manage it.  He
knew as well as I did that our valuation was crazy.<br><br>Yahoo was a special case.  It was not just our price to earnings
ratio that was bogus.  Half our earnings were too.  Not in
the Enron way, of course.  The finance guys seemed
scrupulous about reporting earnings.  What made our
earnings bogus was that Yahoo was, in effect, the center of
a Ponzi scheme.  Investors looked at Yahoo&apos;s earnings
and said to themselves, here is proof that Internet companies can make
money.  So they invested in new
startups that promised to be the next Yahoo.  And as soon as these startups
got the money, what did they do with it?
Buy millions of dollars worth of advertising on Yahoo to promote
their brand.  Result: a capital investment in a startup this
quarter shows up as Yahoo earnings next quarter&#x2014;stimulating
another round of investments in startups.<br><br>As in a Ponzi scheme, what seemed to be the returns of this system
were simply the latest round of investments in it.
What made it not a Ponzi scheme was that it was unintentional.  
At least, I think it was.  The venture capital business is pretty incestuous,
and there were presumably people in a position, if not to create
this situation, to realize what was happening and to milk it.<br><br>A year later the game was up.  Starting in January 2000, Yahoo&apos;s
stock price began to crash, ultimately losing 95% of its
value.<br><br>Notice, though, that even with all the fat trimmed off its market
cap, Yahoo was still worth a lot.  Even at the morning-after
valuations of March and April 2001, the people at Yahoo had managed
to create a company worth about $8 billion in just six years.<br><br>The fact is, despite all the nonsense we heard
during the Bubble about the &quot;new economy,&quot; there was a
core of truth.  You need
that to get a really big bubble: you need to have something
solid at the center, so that even smart people are sucked in.
(Isaac Newton and Jonathan Swift both lost money
in the South Sea Bubble of 1720.)<br><br>Now the pendulum has swung the other way.  Now anything that
became fashionable during the Bubble is ipso facto unfashionable.
But that&apos;s a mistake&#x2014;an even bigger mistake than believing
what everyone was saying in 1999.  Over the long term,
what the Bubble got right will be more important than what
it got wrong.<br><br><b>1. Retail VC</b><br><br>After the excesses of the Bubble, it&apos;s now
considered dubious to take companies public before they have earnings.
But there is nothing intrinsically wrong with
that idea.  Taking a company public at an early stage is simply
retail VC: instead of going to venture capital firms for the last round of
funding, you go to the public markets.<br><br>By the end of the Bubble, companies going public with no
earnings were being derided as &quot;concept stocks,&quot; as if it
were inherently stupid to invest in them.
But investing in concepts isn&apos;t stupid; it&apos;s what VCs do,
and the best of them are far from stupid.<br><br>The stock of a company that doesn&apos;t yet have earnings is  
worth <i>something.</i>
It may take a while for the market to learn
how to value such companies, just as it had to learn to
value common stocks in the early 20th century.   But markets
are good at solving that kind of problem.  I wouldn&apos;t be
surprised if the market ultimately did a better
job than VCs do now.<br><br>Going public early will not be the right plan
for every company.
And it can of course be
disruptive&#x2014;by distracting the management, or by making the early
employees suddenly rich.  But just as the market will learn
how to value startups, startups will learn how to minimize
the damage of going public.<br><br><b>2. The Internet</b><br><br>The Internet genuinely is a big deal.  That was one reason
even smart people were fooled by the Bubble.  Obviously 
it was going to have a huge effect.  Enough of an effect to
triple the value of Nasdaq companies in two years?  No, as it
turned out.  But it was hard to say for certain at the time. [1]<br><br>The same thing happened during the Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles.
What drove them was the invention of organized public finance
(the South Sea Company, despite its name, was really a competitor
of the Bank of England).  And that did turn out to be
a big deal, in the long run.<br><br>Recognizing an important trend turns out to be easier than 
figuring out how to profit from it.  The mistake
investors always seem to make is to take the trend too literally.
Since the Internet was the big new thing, investors supposed
that the more Internettish the company, the better.  Hence
such parodies as Pets.Com.<br><br>In fact most of the money to be made from big trends is made
indirectly.  It was not the railroads themselves that 
made the most money during the railroad boom, but the companies
on either side, like Carnegie&apos;s steelworks, which made the rails,
and Standard Oil, which used railroads to get oil to the East Coast,
where it could be shipped to Europe.<br><br>I think the Internet will have great effects,
and that what we&apos;ve seen so far is nothing compared to what&apos;s
coming.  But most of the winners will only indirectly be
Internet companies; for every Google there will be ten
JetBlues.<br><br><b>3. Choices</b><br><br>Why will the Internet have great effects?  The general   
argument is that new forms of communication always do.  They happen
rarely (till industrial times there were just speech, writing, and printing),
but when they do, they always cause a big splash.<br><br>The specific argument, or one of them, is the Internet gives us  
more choices.  In the &quot;old&quot; economy,
the high cost of presenting information to people meant they
had only a narrow range of options to choose from.  The tiny,
expensive pipeline to consumers was tellingly named &quot;the channel.&quot;
Control the channel and you
could feed them what you wanted, on your terms.  And it
was not just big corporations that depended
on this principle.  So, in their way, did
labor unions, the traditional news media,
and the art and literary establishments.
Winning depended not on doing good work, but on gaining control
of some bottleneck.<br><br>There are signs that this is changing.
Google has over 82 million unique users a month and
annual revenues of about three billion dollars. [2]
And yet have you ever seen
a Google ad?
Something is going on here.<br><br>Admittedly, Google is an extreme case.  It&apos;s very easy for
people to switch to a new search engine.  It costs little
effort and no money to try a new one, and it&apos;s easy to
see if the results are better.  And so Google doesn&apos;t <i>have</i>
to advertise.  In a business like theirs, being the best is
enough.<br><br>The exciting thing about the Internet is that it&apos;s
shifting everything in that direction.
The hard part, if you want to win by making the best stuff,
is the beginning.  Eventually everyone
will learn by word of mouth that you&apos;re the best,
but how do you survive to that point?  And it is in this crucial
stage that the Internet has the most effect.  First, the
Internet lets anyone find you at almost zero cost.
Second, it dramatically speeds up the rate at which
reputation spreads by word of mouth.  Together these mean that in many
fields the rule will be: Build it, and they will come.
Make something great and put it online.
That is a big change from the recipe for winning in the
past century.<br><br><b>4. Youth</b><br><br>The aspect of the Internet Bubble that the press seemed most
taken with was the youth of some of the startup founders.
This too is a trend that will last.
There is a huge standard deviation among 26 year olds.  Some
are fit only for entry level jobs, but others are
ready to rule the world if they can find someone to handle
the paperwork for them.<br><br>A 26 year old may not be very good at managing people or
dealing with the SEC.  Those require experience.
But those are also commodities, which can be handed off to
some lieutenant.  The most important quality in a CEO is his
vision for the company&apos;s future.  What will they build next?
And in that department, there are 26 year olds who can
compete with anyone.<br><br>In 1970 a company president meant someone in his fifties, at
least.   If he had technologists working for him, they were 
treated like a racing stable: prized, but not powerful.  But 
as technology has grown more important, the power of nerds
has grown to reflect it.  Now it&apos;s not enough for a CEO to
have someone smart he can ask about technical matters.   Increasingly,
he has to be that person himself.<br><br>As always, business has clung to old forms.  VCs still seem
to want to install a legitimate-looking 
talking head as the CEO.  But increasingly the founders of
the company are the real powers, and the grey-headed man
installed by the VCs more like a
music group&apos;s manager than a general.<br><br><b>5. Informality</b><br><br>In New York, the Bubble had dramatic consequences:
suits went out of fashion.  They made one seem old.  So in
1998 powerful New York types were suddenly wearing
open-necked shirts and khakis and oval wire-rimmed glasses,
just like guys in Santa Clara.<br><br>The pendulum has swung back a bit, driven in part by a panicked
reaction by the clothing industry.  But I&apos;m betting on the
open-necked shirts.  And this is not as frivolous a question
as it might seem.  Clothes are important, as all nerds can sense,
though they may not realize it consciously.<br><br>If you&apos;re a nerd, you can understand how important clothes are
by asking yourself how you&apos;d feel about a company
that made you wear a suit and tie to work.  The idea sounds
horrible, doesn&apos;t it?  In fact, horrible far out of proportion
to the mere discomfort of wearing such clothes.  A company that
made programmers wear suits would have something deeply wrong
with it.<br><br>And what would be wrong would be that how one presented oneself
counted more than the quality of one&apos;s ideas.  <i>That&apos;s</i>
the problem with formality.  Dressing up is not so much bad in
itself.  The problem is the receptor it binds to: dressing
up is inevitably a substitute
for good ideas.   It is no coincidence that technically
inept business types are known as &quot;suits.&quot;<br><br>Nerds don&apos;t just happen to dress informally.  They do it too
consistently.  Consciously or not, they dress informally as
a prophylactic measure against stupidity.<br><br><b>6. Nerds</b><br><br>Clothing is only the most visible battleground in the war
against formality.  Nerds tend to eschew formality of any sort.
They&apos;re not impressed by one&apos;s job title, for example,
or any of the other appurtenances of authority.<br><br>Indeed, that&apos;s practically the definition of a nerd.  I found
myself talking recently to someone from Hollywood who was planning
a show about nerds.  I thought it would be useful if I
explained what a nerd was.  What I came up with was: someone who
doesn&apos;t expend any effort on marketing himself.<br><br>A nerd, in other words, is someone who concentrates on substance.
So what&apos;s the connection between nerds and technology? Roughly
that you can&apos;t fool mother nature. In technical matters, you
have to get the right answers.  If your software miscalculates
the path of a space probe, you can&apos;t finesse your way out of
trouble by saying that your code is patriotic, or avant-garde,
or any of the other dodges people use in nontechnical
fields.<br><br>And as technology becomes increasingly important in the
economy, nerd culture is 
<a href="nerdad.html">rising</a> with it.  Nerds are already
a lot cooler than they were when I was a kid.  When I was in
college in the mid-1980s, &quot;nerd&quot; was still an insult.  People
who majored in computer science generally tried to conceal it.
Now women ask me where they can meet nerds.  (The answer that
springs to mind is &quot;Usenix,&quot; but that would be like drinking
from a firehose.)<br><br>I have no illusions about why nerd culture is becoming
more accepted.  It&apos;s not because people are
realizing that substance is more important than marketing.
It&apos;s because the nerds are getting 
rich.  But that is not going
to change.<br><br><b>7. Options</b><br><br>What makes the nerds rich, usually, is stock options.  Now there
are moves afoot to make it harder for companies to grant   
options.  To the extent there&apos;s some genuine accounting abuse 
going on, by all means correct it.  But don&apos;t kill the golden  
goose.  Equity is the fuel that drives technical innovation.<br><br>Options are a good idea because (a) they&apos;re fair, and (b) they
work.  Someone who goes to work for a company is (one hopes)   
adding to its value, and it&apos;s only fair to give them a share
of it.  And as a purely practical measure, people work a <i>lot</i>
harder when they have options.  I&apos;ve seen that first hand.<br><br>The fact that a few crooks during the Bubble robbed their
companies by granting themselves options doesn&apos;t mean options
are a bad idea.  During the railroad boom, some executives
enriched themselves by selling watered stock&#x2014;by issuing more
shares than they said were outstanding.  But that doesn&apos;t  
make common stock a bad idea.  Crooks just use whatever
means are available.<br><br>If there is a problem with options, it&apos;s that they reward
slightly the wrong thing.  Not surprisingly, people do what you
pay them to. If you pay them by the hour, they&apos;ll work a lot of
hours.  If you pay them by the volume of work done, they&apos;ll
get a lot of work done (but only as you defined work).
And if you pay them to raise the
stock price, which is what options amount to, they&apos;ll raise
the stock price.<br><br>But that&apos;s not quite what you want.  What you want is to
increase the actual value of the company, not its market cap.
Over time the two inevitably meet, but not always as quickly
as options vest.  Which means options tempt employees, if
only unconsciously, to &quot;pump and dump&quot;&#x2014;to do things
that will make the company <i>seem</i> valuable.
I found that when I was at Yahoo, I couldn&apos;t help thinking,   
&quot;how will this sound to investors?&quot;  when I should have been
thinking &quot;is this a good idea?&quot;<br><br>So maybe the standard option deal needs to be tweaked slightly.
Maybe options should be replaced with something tied more
directly to earnings.  It&apos;s still early days.<br><br><b>8. Startups</b><br><br>What made the options valuable, for the most part, is
that they were options on the stock of 
<a href="start.html">startups</a>.  Startups   
were not of course a creation of the Bubble, but they
were more visible during the Bubble than ever before.<br><br>One thing most people did learn about for the first time
during the Bubble was the startup
created with the intention of selling it.
Originally a
startup meant a small company that hoped to grow into a
big one.  But increasingly startups are evolving into a
vehicle for developing technology on spec.<br><br>As I wrote in
<a href="hackpaint.html">Hackers &amp; Painters</a>, employees seem to be most
productive when they&apos;re paid in proportion to the wealth
they generate.  And the advantage of a startup&#x2014;indeed,   
almost its raison d&apos;etre&#x2014;is that it offers something
otherwise impossible to obtain: a way of <i>measuring</i> that.<br><br>In many businesses, it just makes more sense for companies
to get technology by buying startups rather than developing   
it in house.  You pay more, but there is less risk,
and risk is what big companies don&apos;t want.  It makes the
guys developing the technology more accountable, because they
only get paid if they build the winner.  And you end up   
with better technology, created faster, because things are
made in the innovative atmosphere of startups instead of 
the bureaucratic atmosphere of big companies.<br><br>Our startup, Viaweb, was built to be sold.  We were open
with investors about that from the start.  And we were     
careful to create something that could slot easily into a
larger company.  That is the pattern for the future.<br><br><b>9. California</b><br><br>The Bubble was a California phenomenon.  When I showed up
in Silicon Valley in 1998, I felt like an immigrant from
Eastern Europe arriving in America in 1900.  Everyone
was so cheerful and healthy and rich.  It seemed a new
and improved world.<br><br>The press, ever eager to exaggerate small trends, now gives  
one the impression that Silicon Valley is a ghost town.
Not at all.  When I drive down 101 from the airport,
I still feel a buzz of energy, as if there were a giant
transformer nearby.  Real estate is still more expensive
than just about anywhere else in the country.  The people     
still look healthy, and the weather is still fabulous.
The future is there.
(I say &quot;there&quot; because I moved back to the East Coast after
Yahoo.  I still wonder if this was a smart idea.)<br><br>What makes the Bay Area superior is the attitude of the
people.  I notice that when I come home to Boston.
The first thing I see when I walk out of the airline terminal
is the fat, grumpy guy in
charge of the taxi line.  I brace myself for rudeness:
<i>remember, you&apos;re back on the East Coast now.</i><br><br>The atmosphere varies from city to city, and fragile
organisms like startups are exceedingly sensitive to such variation.
If it hadn&apos;t already been hijacked as a new euphemism
for liberal, the word to describe the atmosphere in
the Bay Area would be &quot;progressive.&quot;  People there are trying
to build the future.
Boston has MIT and Harvard, but it also has a lot of
truculent, unionized employees like the police who
recently held the Democratic National Convention for   
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-04-30-boston-police-convention_x.htm">ransom</a>, and a lot of people trying to be
 Thurston Howell.
Two sides of an obsolete coin.<br><br>Silicon Valley may not be the next Paris or London, but it
is at least the next Chicago.  For the next fifty years,   
that&apos;s where new wealth will come from.<br><br><b>10. Productivity</b><br><br>During the Bubble, optimistic analysts used to justify high
price to earnings ratios by saying that technology was going 
to increase productivity dramatically.  They were wrong about
the specific companies, but not so wrong about the underlying
principle.  I think one of the big trends we&apos;ll see in the
coming century is a huge increase in productivity.<br><br>Or more precisely, a huge increase in <a href="gh.html">variation</a> in
productivity.  Technology is a lever.  It doesn&apos;t add;     
it multiplies.  If the present range of productivity is  
0 to 100, introducing a multiple of 10 increases the range
from 0 to 1000.<br><br>One upshot of which is that the companies of the future may
be surprisingly small.  I sometimes daydream about how big
you could grow a company (in revenues) without ever having
more than ten people.  What would happen if you outsourced
everything except product development?  If you tried this experiment,
I think you&apos;d be surprised at how far you could get. 
As Fred Brooks pointed out, small groups are
intrinsically more productive, because the
internal friction in a group grows as the
square of its size.<br><br>Till quite recently, running a major company
meant managing an army of workers.  Our standards about how
many employees a company should have are still influenced by
old patterns.  Startups are perforce small, because they can&apos;t
afford to hire a lot of people.  But I think it&apos;s a big mistake for
companies to loosen their belts as revenues increase.  The
question is not whether you can afford the extra salaries.   
Can you afford the loss in productivity that comes from making
the company bigger?<br><br>The prospect of technological leverage will of course raise the
specter of unemployment.  I&apos;m surprised people still worry about
this.
After centuries of supposedly job-killing innovations,
the number of jobs is within ten percent of the number of people
who want them.  This can&apos;t be a coincidence.  There must be some
kind of balancing mechanism.<br><br><b>What&apos;s New</b><br><br>When one looks over these trends, is there any overall theme?
There does seem to be: that in the coming century, good ideas
will count for more.  That 26
year olds with good ideas will increasingly have an edge over 50
year olds with powerful connections.  That doing good work will
matter more than dressing up&#x2014;or advertising, which is the
same thing for companies.  That people
will be rewarded a bit more in proportion to the value of what
they create.<br><br>If so, this is good news indeed.
Good ideas always tend to win eventually.  The problem is,
it can take a very long time.
It took decades for relativity to be accepted, and the
greater part of a century to establish that central planning didn&apos;t work.
So even a small increase in the
rate at which good ideas win would be a momentous
change&#x2014;big enough, probably, to justify a name like
the &quot;new economy.&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] Actually it&apos;s hard to say now.  As Jeremy Siegel points
out, if the value of a stock is its future earnings, you 
can&apos;t tell if it was overvalued till you see what the earnings
turn out to be.   While certain famous Internet stocks were
almost certainly overvalued in 1999, it is still hard to say for sure
whether, e.g., the Nasdaq index was.<br><br>Siegel, Jeremy J.  &quot;What Is an Asset Price Bubble?  An

As E. B. White said, &quot;good writing is rewriting.&quot;  I didn&apos;t
realize this when I was in school.  In writing, as in math and 
science, they only show you the finished product.
You don&apos;t see all the false starts.  This gives students a
misleading view of how things get made.<br><br>Part of the reason it happens is that writers don&apos;t want   
people to see their mistakes.  But I&apos;m willing to let people
see an early draft if it will show how much you have
to rewrite to beat an essay into shape.<br><br>Below is the oldest version I can find of
<a href="essay.html">The Age of the Essay</a>   
(probably the second or third day), with
text that ultimately survived in 
<font color="#aa0000">red</font> and text that later
got deleted in <font color="#777777">gray</font>.
There seem to be several categories of cuts: things I got wrong,
things that seem like bragging, flames,
digressions, stretches of awkward prose, and unnecessary words.<br><br>I discarded more from the beginning.  That&apos;s
not surprising; it takes a while to hit your stride.  There
are more digressions at the start, because I&apos;m not sure where
I&apos;m heading.<br><br>The amount of cutting is about average.  I probably write
three to four words for every one that appears in the final
version of an essay.<br><br>(Before anyone gets mad at me for opinions expressed here, remember
that anything you see here that&apos;s not in the final version is obviously
something I chose not to publish, often because I disagree
with it.)<br><br><br><br><font color="#777777">
Recently a friend said that what he liked about
my essays was that they weren&apos;t written the way
we&apos;d been taught to write essays in school.  You
remember: <font color="#aa0000">topic sentence, introductory paragraph,
supporting paragraphs, conclusion.</font>  It hadn&apos;t
occurred to me till then that those horrible things
we had to write in school were even connected to
what I was doing now.  But sure enough, I thought,
they did call them &quot;essays,&quot; didn&apos;t they?<br><br>Well, they&apos;re not.  Those things you have to write
in school are not only not essays, they&apos;re one of the
most pointless of all the pointless hoops you have
to jump through in school.  And I worry that they
not only teach students the wrong things about writing,
but put them off writing entirely.<br><br><font color="#aa0000">So I&apos;m going to give the other side of the story: what
an essay really is, and how you write one.  Or at least,
how I write one.</font>  Students be forewarned: if you actually write
the kind of essay I describe, you&apos;ll probably get bad
grades.  But knowing how it&apos;s really done should
at least help you to understand the feeling of futility
you have when you&apos;re writing the things they tell you to.<br><br><font color="#aa0000">
The most obvious difference between real essays and
the things one has to write in school is that real
essays are not exclusively about English literature.</font>
It&apos;s a fine thing for schools to
<font color="#aa0000">
teach students how to
write.</font>  But for some bizarre reason (actually, a very specific bizarre
reason that I&apos;ll explain in a moment),
<font color="#aa0000">
the teaching of
writing has gotten mixed together with the study
of literature.  And so all over the country, students are
writing not about how a baseball team with a small budget 
might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in
fashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about
symbolism in Dickens.</font><br><br><font color="#aa0000">With</font> obvious 
<font color="#aa0000">result</font>s.  Only a few people really
<font color="#aa0000">
care about
symbolism in Dickens.</font>  The teacher doesn&apos;t.
The students don&apos;t.  Most of the people who&apos;ve had to write PhD
disserations about Dickens don&apos;t.  And certainly
<font color="#aa0000">
Dickens himself would be more interested in an essay
about color or baseball.<br><br>How did things get this way?  To answer that we have to go back
almost a thousand years.</font>  Between about 500 and 1000, life was
not very good in Europe.  The term &quot;dark ages&quot; is presently
out of fashion as too judgemental (the period wasn&apos;t dark; 
it was just <i>different</i>), but if this label didn&apos;t already
exist, it would seem an inspired metaphor.  What little
original thought there was took place in lulls between
constant wars and had something of the character of
the thoughts of parents with a new baby.
The most amusing thing written during this
period, Liudprand of Cremona&apos;s Embassy to Constantinople, is,
I suspect, mostly inadvertantly so.<br><br>Around 1000 <font color="#aa0000">Europe began to catch its breath.
And once they
had the luxury of curiosity,</font> one of the first things they discovered
was <font color="#aa0000">what we call &quot;the classics.&quot;</font>
Imagine if <font color="#aa0000">we were visited  
by</font> aliens.  If they could even get here they&apos;d presumably know a
few things we don&apos;t.  Immediately Alien Studies would become
the most dynamic field of scholarship: instead of painstakingly
discovering things for ourselves, we could simply suck up
everything they&apos;d discovered.  So it was in Europe in 1200.
When classical texts began to circulate in Europe, they contained
not just new answers, but new questions.  (If anyone proved
a theorem in christian Europe before 1200, for example, there
is no record of it.)<br><br>For a couple centuries, some of the most important work
being done was intellectual archaelogy.  Those were also
the centuries during which schools were first established.
And since reading ancient texts was the <font color="#aa0000">essence of what
scholars did</font> then, it became the basis of the curriculum.<br><br>By 1700, <font color="#aa0000">someone who wanted to learn about</font>
physics didn&apos;t need to start by mastering Greek in order to read <font color="#aa0000">Aristotle.  But schools
change slower than scholarship</font>: <font color="#aa0000">the study of
ancient texts</font>
had such prestige that it remained <font color="#aa0000">the backbone of</font> 
education
until the late 19th century.  By then it was merely a tradition.
It did serve some purposes: reading a foreign language was difficult,
and thus taught discipline, or at least, kept students busy;
it introduced students to
cultures quite different from their own; and its very uselessness
made it function (like white gloves) as a social bulwark.
But it certainly wasn&apos;t
true, and hadn&apos;t been true for centuries, that students were
serving apprenticeships in the hottest area of scholarship.<br><br>Classical scholarship had also changed.  In the early era, philology
actually mattered.  The texts that filtered into Europe were
all corrupted to some degree by the errors of translators and
copyists.  Scholars had to figure out what Aristotle said
before they could figure out what he meant.  But by the modern
era such questions were answered as well as they were ever
going to be.  And so the study of ancient texts became less
about ancientness and more about texts.<br><br><font color="#aa0000">The time was then ripe for the question: if the study of
ancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not modern
texts?  The answer, of course, is that the raison d&apos;etre
of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaelogy that
does not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors.
But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer.
The archaeological work being mostly done, it implied that
the people studying the classics were, if not wasting their
time, at least working on problems of minor importance.<br><br>And so began the study of modern literature. There was</font> some
initial <font color="#aa0000">resistance</font>, but it didn&apos;t last long.
The limiting
reagent in the growth of university departments is what
parents will let undergraduates study.  If parents will let
their children major in x, the rest follows straightforwardly.
There will be jobs teaching x, and professors to fill them.
The professors will establish scholarly journals and publish
one another&apos;s papers.  Universities with x departments will
subscribe to the journals.  Graduate students who want jobs
as professors of x will write dissertations about it.  It may
take a good long while for the more prestigious universities
to cave in and establish departments in cheesier xes,  but
at the other end of the scale there are so many universities
competing to attract students that the mere establishment of
a discipline requires little more than the desire to do it.<br><br><font color="#aa0000">High schools imitate universities.</font>
And so once university
English departments were established in the late nineteenth century,
<font color="#aa0000">the &apos;riting component of the 3 Rs</font> 
was <font color="#aa0000">morphed into English.
With the bizarre consequence that high school students now
had to write about English literature-- to write, without
even realizing it, imitations of whatever
English professors had been publishing in their journals a
few decades before.   It&apos;s no wonder if this seems to the
student a pointless exercise, because we&apos;re now three steps
removed from real work: the students are imitating English
professors, who are imitating classical scholars, who are
merely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what
was, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.</font><br><br>Perhaps high schools should drop English and just teach writing.
The valuable part of English classes is learning to write, and
that could be taught better by itself.  Students learn better
when they&apos;re interested in what they&apos;re doing, and it&apos;s hard
to imagine a topic less interesting than symbolism in Dickens.
Most of the people who write about that sort of thing professionally
are not really interested in it.  (Though indeed, it&apos;s been a
while since they were writing about symbolism; now they&apos;re
writing about gender.)<br><br>I have no illusions about how eagerly this suggestion will  
be adopted.  Public schools probably couldn&apos;t stop teaching
English even if they wanted to; they&apos;re probably required to by
law.  But here&apos;s a related suggestion that goes with the grain
instead of against it: that universities establish a
writing major.  Many of the students who now major in English
would major in writing if they could, and most would
be better off.<br><br>It will be argued that it is a good thing for students to be
exposed to their literary heritage.  Certainly.  But is that
more important than that they learn to write well?  And are
English classes even the place to do it?  After all,
the average public high school student gets zero exposure to  
his artistic heritage.  No disaster results.
The people who are interested in art learn about it for
themselves, and those who aren&apos;t don&apos;t.  I find that American
adults are no better or worse informed about literature than
art, despite the fact that they spent years studying literature
in high school and no time at all studying art.  Which presumably
means that what they&apos;re taught in school is rounding error 
compared to what they pick up on their own.<br><br>Indeed, English classes may even be harmful.  In my case they
were effectively aversion therapy.  Want to make someone dislike
a book?  Force him to read it and write an essay about it.
And make the topic so intellectually bogus that you
could not, if asked, explain why one ought to write about it.
I love to read more than anything, but by the end of high school
I never read the books we were assigned.  I was so disgusted with
what we were doing that it became a point of honor
with me to write nonsense at least as good at the other students&apos;
without having more than glanced over the book to learn the names
of the characters and a few random events in it.<br><br>I hoped this might be fixed in college, but I found the same
problem there.  It was not the teachers.  It was English.   
We were supposed to read novels and write essays about them.
About what, and why?  That no one seemed to be able to explain.
Eventually by trial and error I found that what the teacher  
wanted us to do was pretend that the story had really taken
place, and to analyze based on what the characters said and did (the
subtler clues, the better) what their motives must have been.
One got extra credit for motives having to do with class,
as I suspect one must now for those involving gender and  
sexuality.  I learned how to churn out such stuff well enough
to get an A, but I never took another English class.<br><br>And the books we did these disgusting things to, like those
we mishandled in high school, I find still have black marks
against them in my mind.  The one saving grace was that   
English courses tend to favor pompous, dull writers like
Henry James, who deserve black marks against their names anyway.
One of the principles the IRS uses in deciding whether to
allow deductions is that, if something is fun, it isn&apos;t work.
Fields that are intellectually unsure of themselves rely on
a similar principle.  Reading P.G. Wodehouse or Evelyn Waugh or
Raymond Chandler is too obviously pleasing to seem like
serious work, as reading Shakespeare would have been before 
English evolved enough to make it an effort to understand him. [sh]
And so good writers (just you wait and see who&apos;s still in
print in 300 years) are less likely to have readers turned   
against them by clumsy, self-appointed tour guides.<br><br>
<font color="#aa0000">The other big difference between a real essay and the 
things
they make you write in school is that a real essay doesn&apos;t 
take a position and then defend it.  That principle,
like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature,   
turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long
forgotten origins.  It&apos;s often mistakenly believed that
medieval universities were mostly seminaries.  In fact they
were more law schools.  And at least in our tradition
lawyers are advocates</font>: they are
<font color="#aa0000">trained to</font> be able to
<font color="#aa0000">take
either side of an argument and make as good a case for it  
as they can. </font><br><br>Whether or not this is a good idea (in the case of prosecutors,
it probably isn&apos;t), it tended to <font color="#aa0000">pervade</font>
the atmosphere of
<font color="#aa0000">early universities.  After the lecture the most common form
of discussion was the disputation.  This</font> idea
<font color="#aa0000">is at least
nominally preserved in our present-day thesis defense</font>-- indeed,
in the very word thesis.  <font color="#aa0000">Most people treat the words 
thesis
and dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least,
a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation was
the argument by which one defended it.</font><br><br>I&apos;m not complaining that we blur these two words together.
As far as I&apos;m concerned, the sooner we lose the original
sense of the word thesis, the better.  For many, perhaps most,  
graduate students, it is stuffing a square peg into a round
hole to try to recast one&apos;s work as a single thesis.  And
as for the disputation, that seems clearly a net lose.
Arguing two sides of a case <font color="#aa0000">may be a necessary evil in a
legal dispute, but it&apos;s not the best way to get at the truth,
as I think lawyers would be the first to admit.</font><br><br><font color="#aa0000">
And yet this principle is built into the very structure of  
the</font> essays
<font color="#aa0000">they teach you to write in high school.  The topic
sentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the supporting 
paragraphs the blows you strike in the conflict, and the
conclusion--- uh, what it the conclusion?  I was never sure  
about that in high school.</font>  If your thesis was well expressed,
what need was there to restate it?  In theory it seemed that
the conclusion of a really good essay ought not to need to   
say any more than QED.
<font color="#aa0000">But when you understand the origins
of this sort of &quot;essay&quot;, you can see where the
conclusion comes from.  It&apos;s the concluding remarks to the 
jury.</font><br><br>
What other alternative is there?  To answer that
<font color="#aa0000">we have to
reach back into history again, though this time not so far.
To Michel de Montaigne,</font> inventor of the essay.
<font color="#aa0000">He was
doing something quite different from what</font> a
<font color="#aa0000">lawyer do</font>es,
<font color="#aa0000">and
the difference is embodied in the name.  Essayer is the French
verb meaning &quot;to try&quot;</font> (the cousin of our word assay),
<font color="#aa0000">
and an &quot;essai&quot; is an</font> effort.
<font color="#aa0000">An essay is something you
write</font> in order
<font color="#aa0000">to figure something out.<br><br>Figure out what?  You don&apos;t know yet.  And so you can&apos;t begin with a
thesis, because you don&apos;t have one, and may never have 
one.  An essay doesn&apos;t begin with a statement, but with a  
question.  In a real essay, you don&apos;t take a position and
defend it.  You see a door that&apos;s ajar, and you open it and
walk in to see what&apos;s inside.<br><br>If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you need
to write anything, though?  Why not just sit and think?  Well,
there precisely is Montaigne&apos;s great discovery.  Expressing
ideas helps to form them.  Indeed, helps is far too weak a
word.</font>  90%
<font color="#aa0000">of what ends up in my essays</font> was stuff
<font color="#aa0000">I only
thought of when I sat down to write them.  That&apos;s why I
write them.</font><br><br>So there&apos;s another difference between essays and
<font color="#aa0000">the things
you have to write in school</font>.   In school
<font color="#aa0000">
you are, in theory,
explaining yourself to</font> someone else.  In the best case---if
you&apos;re really organized---you&apos;re just writing it <i>down.</i>
<font color="#aa0000">In a real essay you&apos;re writing for yourself.  You&apos;re
thinking out loud.<br><br>But not quite.  Just as inviting people over forces you to
clean up your apartment, writing something that</font> you know
<font color="#aa0000">
other people will read forces you to think well.  So it
does matter to have an audience.  The things I&apos;ve written
just for myself are no good.</font>  Indeed, they&apos;re bad in
a particular way:
<font color="#aa0000">they tend to peter out.  When I run into
difficulties, I</font> notice that I
<font color="#aa0000">tend to conclude with a few vague
questions and then drift off to get a cup of tea.</font><br><br>This seems a common problem.
It&apos;s practically the standard
ending in blog entries--- with the addition of a &quot;heh&quot; or an 
emoticon, prompted by the all too accurate sense that
something is missing.<br><br>And indeed, a lot of
<font color="#aa0000">published essays peter out in</font> this
<font color="#aa0000">same way.
Particularly the sort written by the staff writers of newsmagazines.  Outside writers tend to supply
editorials of the defend-a-position variety, which
make a beeline toward a rousing (and
foreordained) conclusion.   But the staff writers feel
obliged to write something</font> more
<font color="#aa0000">balanced</font>, which in
practice ends up meaning blurry.
<font color="#aa0000">Since they&apos;re
writing for a popular magazine, they start with the
most radioactively controversial questions, from which</font>
(<font color="#aa0000">because they&apos;re writing for a popular magazine</font>)
<font color="#aa0000">they then proceed to recoil</font> from
<font color="#aa0000">in terror.</font>
Gay marriage, <font color="#aa0000">for or
against?  This group says one thing.  That group says
another.  One thing is certain: the question is a
complex one.  (But don&apos;t get mad at us.  We didn&apos;t
draw any conclusions.)<br><br>Questions aren&apos;t enough.  An essay has to come up with answers.
They don&apos;t always, of course.  Sometimes you start with a  
promising question and get nowhere.  But those you don&apos;t
publish.  Those are like experiments that get inconclusive
results.   Something you publish ought to tell the reader  
something he didn&apos;t already know.<br><br>
But <i>what</i> you tell him doesn&apos;t matter, so long as   
it&apos;s interesting.  I&apos;m sometimes accused of meandering.
In defend-a-position writing that would be a flaw.
There you&apos;re not concerned with truth.  You already
know where you&apos;re going, and you want to go straight there,
blustering through obstacles, and hand-waving
your way across swampy ground.  But that&apos;s not what
you&apos;re trying to do in an essay.  An essay is supposed to
be a search for truth.  It would be suspicious if it didn&apos;t
meander.<br><br>The Meander is a river in</font> Asia Minor (aka
<font color="#aa0000">Turkey</font>).
<font color="#aa0000">As you might expect, it winds all over the place.
But</font> does it
<font color="#aa0000">do this out of frivolity</font>?   Quite the opposite.
Like all rivers, it&apos;s rigorously following the laws of physics.
<font color="#aa0000">The path it has discovered</font>,
winding as it is, represents
<font color="#aa0000">the most economical route to the sea.<br><br>The river&apos;s algorithm is simple.  At each step, flow down.
For the essayist this translates to: flow interesting.
Of all the places to go next, choose</font>
whichever seems
<font color="#aa0000">most interesting.</font><br><br>I&apos;m pushing this metaphor a bit.  An essayist
<font color="#aa0000">can&apos;t have
quite as little foresight as a river.</font>  In fact what you do
(or what I do) is somewhere between a river and a roman
road-builder.  I have a general idea of the direction
I want to go in, and
I choose the next topic with that in mind.  This essay is
about writing, so I do occasionally yank it back in that
direction, but it is not all the sort of essay I
thought I was going to write about writing.<br><br>Note too that hill-climbing (which is what this algorithm is
called) can get you in trouble.
<font color="#aa0000">Sometimes,</font> just
<font color="#aa0000">like a river,</font>
you
<font color="#aa0000">run up against a blank wall.</font>  What
<font color="#aa0000">I do</font> then is just 
<font color="#aa0000">what the river does: backtrack.
At one point in this essay
I found that after following a certain thread I ran out
of ideas.  I had to go back</font> n
<font color="#aa0000">paragraphs and start over
in another direction.</font>  For illustrative purposes I&apos;ve left
the abandoned branch as a footnote.<br><br><font color="#aa0000">
Err on the side of the river.  An essay is not a reference
work.  It&apos;s not something you read looking for a specific
answer, and feel cheated if you don&apos;t find it.  I&apos;d much
rather read an essay that went off in an unexpected but
interesting direction than one that plodded dutifully along
a prescribed course.<br><br>So what&apos;s interesting?  For me, interesting means surprise.
Design, as </font>Matz
<font color="#aa0000">has said, should follow the principle of
least</font> surprise.
<font color="#aa0000">A button that looks like it will make a
machine stop should make it stop, not speed up.  Essays
should do the opposite.  Essays should aim for maximum
surprise.<br><br>I was afraid of flying for a long time and could only travel
vicariously.  When friends came back from faraway places,
it wasn&apos;t just out of politeness that I asked them</font> about
their trip.
<font color="#aa0000">I really wanted to know.  And I found</font> that
<font color="#aa0000">the best way to get information out of them was to ask
what surprised them.  How was the place different from what
they expected?  This is an extremely useful question.
You can ask it of</font> even
<font color="#aa0000">the most unobservant people, and it will
extract information they didn&apos;t even know they were
recording. </font><br><br>Indeed, you can ask it in real time.  Now when I go somewhere
new, I make a note of what surprises me about it.  Sometimes I
even make a conscious effort to visualize the place beforehand,
so I&apos;ll have a detailed image to diff with reality.<br><br><font color="#aa0000">
Surprises are</font> facts
<font color="#aa0000">you didn&apos;t</font> already 
<font color="#aa0000">know</font>.
<font color="#aa0000">But</font> they&apos;re
more than that.  They&apos;re facts
<font color="#aa0000">that contradict things you
thought you knew.  And so they&apos;re the most valuable sort of
fact you can get.  They&apos;re like a food that&apos;s not merely
healthy, but counteracts the unhealthy effects of things
you&apos;ve already eaten.<br><br>
How do you find surprises?  Well, therein lies half
the work of essay writing.  (The other half is expressing
yourself well.)</font>   You can at least
<font color="#aa0000">use yourself as a
proxy for the reader.  You should only write about things
you&apos;ve thought about a lot.  And anything you come across
that surprises you, who&apos;ve thought about the topic a lot,
will probably surprise most readers.<br><br>For example, in a recent essay I pointed out that because
you can only judge computer programmers by working with
them, no one knows</font> in programming who the heroes should
be.
<font color="#aa0000">I</font>
certainly
<font color="#aa0000">didn&apos;t realize this when I</font> started writing
the 
<font color="#aa0000">essay, and even now I find it kind of weird.  That&apos;s
what you&apos;re looking for.<br><br>So if you want to write essays, you need two ingredients:</font>
you need
<font color="#aa0000">a few topics that you think about a lot, and</font> you
need <font color="#aa0000">some ability to ferret out the unexpected.<br><br>What should you think about?  My guess is that it
doesn&apos;t matter</font>.  Almost everything is
<font color="#aa0000">interesting if you get deeply
enough into it.</font>  The <font color="#aa0000">one possible exception</font>
are
<font color="#aa0000">things
like working in fast food,</font> which
<font color="#aa0000">have deliberately had all
the variation sucked out of them</font>.
<font color="#aa0000">In retrospect, was there
anything interesting about working in Baskin-Robbins?
Well, it was interesting</font> to notice
<font color="#aa0000">how important color was
to the customers.  Kids a certain age would point into
the case and say that they wanted yellow.  Did they want
French Vanilla or Lemon?  They would just look at you
blankly.  They wanted yellow.  And then there was the
mystery of why the perennial favorite Pralines n&apos; Cream
was so appealing. I</font>&apos;m inclined now to
<font color="#aa0000">think it was the salt.</font>
And the mystery of why Passion Fruit tasted so disgusting.
People would order it because of the name, and were always
disappointed.  It should have been called In-sink-erator
Fruit.
<font color="#aa0000">And</font> there was
<font color="#aa0000">the difference in the way fathers and
mothers bought ice cream for their kids</font>.
<font color="#aa0000">Fathers</font> tended to
adopt the attitude of
<font color="#aa0000">benevolent kings bestowing largesse,</font>
and <font color="#aa0000">mothers</font> that of
<font color="#aa0000">harried</font> bureaucrats,
<font color="#aa0000">giving in to
pressure</font> against their better judgement.
<font color="#aa0000">So, yes, there does seem to be material, even in
fast food.</font><br><br>What about the other half, ferreting out the unexpected?
That may require some natural ability.  I&apos;ve noticed for
a long time that I&apos;m pathologically observant.  ....<br><br>[That was as far as I&apos;d gotten at the time.]<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[sh] In Shakespeare&apos;s own time, serious writing meant theological
discourses, not the bawdy plays acted over on the other  
side of the river among the bear gardens and whorehouses.<br><br>The other extreme, the work that seems formidable from the moment
it&apos;s created (indeed, is deliberately intended to be)
is represented by Milton.  Like the Aeneid, Paradise Lost is a
rock imitating a butterfly that happened to get fossilized.
Even Samuel Johnson seems to have balked at this, on the one  
hand paying Milton the compliment of an extensive biography,
and on the other writing of Paradise Lost that &quot;none who read it
ever wished it longer.&quot;<br><br><br><br><!-- <hr>
<font color=#000000>That was as far as I'd gotten at the time.
The rest is a kind of midden that always accumulates at the
end of the file, consisting of notes to myself
and chunks of deleted text that I might (but never do) re-use later.<br><br><br><br>These are the notes about what to work on the next morning.

%  always to have been at least implicitly mistaken   
</pre><br><br><font color=#000000>
This is the part I had to discard when I backtracked.
It used to follow the paragraph that ended with
"prescribed course."</font><br><br>Because you're after answers, instead of just trying to
convince people of something, it's important to qualify
your conclusions precisely.  No scientist will be satisfied
to hear that you measured something and it was 12.7.
12.7 plus or minus what?  What's your experimental error?<br><br>This is just as important for questions whose answers
aren't numbers.
And yet people rarely bother in ordinary
conversation, most scientists included.  Once people
switch over to talking about matters that aren't
"scientific"--- mere matters of opinion--- they pay
comparatively little attention to qualifying what they say.<br><br>Oh, they <i>use</i> qualifiers.  Once kids
arrive in college they learn pretty quickly that proper
intellectuals qualify every statement with "perhaps"
or "almost."  But this kind of qualification is nothing more
than grammatical. Sometimes these automatically inserted
qualifications end up at odds with the statements they're
attached to, yielding comic results.
You find people saying that a certain writer is
"perhaps the greatest writer of the twentieth century."
That's a rather strong way to put something you're not sure
about.  Wouldn't it be better just to say "one of the best
writers of the twentieth century?"<br><br>One of the only people I've ever met who really pays attention
to qualification is my friend Robert Morris.  His great
fear in life is to say something that's mistaken.  So whenever   
he says something, he pays as much attention to expressing
how sure he is of it as he does to what he's saying.  He
is a connoisseur of his own certainty, and has as many words
for expressing it as Eskimos have for snow.  This is how we
all ought to be.  Sticking a perfunctory perhaps onto
every statement may shield us from blame, but it tells the
reader nothing.  That's like the manufacturers of Q-Tips,
who to cover themselves print "do not insert in ear canal" on the
boxes, when they know damned well that that's how Q-Tips are used.<br><br>One of the most important things to know about
painting is that darks make the light.  This is particularly
obvious in watercolor.  Suppose you want to make a painting
that seems glowing with light.  Well, you can't get any
brighter than the white of the paper.  So the only way to
make the make the painting bright is to add darks
that make the lights seem brighter by contrast.  Without
darks, the painting won't seem bright; it will just seem
washed out.<br><br>Some books about writing say that you shouldn't begin
sentences with "I think."  If you're saying something,
the argument does, then obviously you think it, so why
bother telling people?  This is nonsense.  The heavily qualified
statements in an essay play the role of darks.  When you
reach a point you're really sure of, you can just state it with no
qualifications, and it will have all the more force by contrast.<br><br>People aren't used to
unqualified statements.  Without the automatic "perhaps"
they're used to seeing, many realize, with a shock,   
that what they're reading are <i>opinions.</i>
Well of course.  And what essay consists of anything else?
An essay is not a theorem.
You don't have to say only things you can prove irrefutably.
Don't be afraid of expressing your opinions.  Just make sure
you're right.<br><br><br><br><font color=#000000>
Miscellaneous smaller cuts:</font><br><br>The downside is that essays may contain mistakes (though
so can theorems).  The upside is that you can talk about<br><br>more things.<br><br>The world is not divided into the "scientific" and the
"subjective."  Scientific is a matter of degree.  And there
are plenty of questions that would be impractical to
answer by a controlled experiment and yet which are
worth discussing.  Indeed, some of the most interesting
questions are of this type.<br><br>To mathematicians, the work of physicists seems rather
speculative.<br><br>But if they're less precise, they can talk about a broader
range of subjects.<br><br>Sometimes I feel tempted to
add a disclaimer to the beginning of my essays saying,
if you're bothered by unqualified statements, just stick  
the "perhaps" that you're used to seeing before each one.
I mean the same thing.<br><br>Don't expect people to thank you for delivering these  
valuable facts to them, though---any more than they would
thank you for giving them steamed vegetables for dinner.<br><br><br><br><font color=#000000>

you didn't already know.<br><br>An essay must at least explore conclusions, even if
this offends people.  And the disconcerting thing is,
merely exploring ideas does offend people.
Readers used to defend-a-position
writing tend to get as angry with you for saying
"let's explore the possibility that x" as if you had
said "I believe x."  Indeed, some writers use the former
as nothing more than a learned sounding replacement for
the latter.  But in a proper essay,<br><br>But when I want to say x I just say it.<br><br>That sort of thing isn't really an essay either, though

-->
A lot of people are writing now about 
why Kerry lost.  Here I want to
examine a more specific question: why were the exit polls so 
wrong?<br><br>In Ohio, which Kerry ultimately
lost 49-51, exit polls gave him a 52-48 victory.  And this wasn&apos;t just
random error.  In every swing state they overestimated the Kerry vote.
In Florida, which Bush ultimately won 52-47, exit polls predicted
a dead heat.<br><br>(These are not early numbers. They&apos;re from about midnight eastern time, 
long after polls closed in Ohio and Florida.  And yet by the
next afternoon the exit poll numbers online corresponded to the returns.  
The only way I can imagine this happening is if those in
charge of the exit polls cooked the books after seeing the actual
returns.  But that&apos;s another issue.)<br><br>What happened?  The source of the problem may be a variant of
the Bradley Effect.  
This term
was invented after Tom Bradley, the black mayor of Los Angeles, 
lost an election for governor of California despite a comfortable
lead in the polls.  Apparently voters were afraid to say  
they planned to vote against him, lest their motives be
(perhaps correctly) suspected.<br><br>It seems likely that something similar happened in exit polls this year.
In theory, exit polls ought to be very accurate.  
You&apos;re not asking people what they would do.  You&apos;re
asking what they just did.<br><br>How can you get errors asking that?  Because some people don&apos;t
respond.  To get a truly random sample, pollsters ask, say, every
20th person leaving the polling place who they voted for.  But not
everyone wants to answer.  And the pollsters can&apos;t simply ignore
those who won&apos;t, or their sample isn&apos;t random anymore.  So what
they do, apparently, is note down the age and race and sex of the
person, and guess from that who they voted for.<br><br>This works so long as there is no <i>correlation</i> between who people
vote for and whether they&apos;re willing to talk about it.  But this
year there may have been.  It may be that a significant number of 
those who voted for
Bush didn&apos;t want to say so.<br><br>Why not?  Because people in the US are more conservative than they&apos;re
willing to admit.  The values of the elite in this country, at least
at the moment, are NPR values.  The average person, as I think both
Republicans and Democrats would agree, is more socially conservative.  
But while some openly flaunt the fact that they don&apos;t share the
opinions of the elite, others feel a little nervous about it, as 
if they had bad table manners.<br><br>For example, according to current NPR values, you 
<a href="say.html">can&apos;t say</a> anything that might be 
perceived as disparaging towards homosexuals.  To do  
so is &quot;homophobic.&quot;  And yet a large number of Americans are deeply
religious, and the Bible is quite explicit on the subject of
homosexuality.  What are they to do?  I think what many do is keep 
their opinions, but keep them to themselves.<br><br>They know what they believe, but they also know what they&apos;re supposed
to believe.
And so when a stranger (for example, a pollster) asks
them their opinion about something like gay marriage, they will not
always say what they really think.<br><br>When the values of the elite are liberal, polls will tend to
underestimate the conservativeness of ordinary voters.  This seems
to me the leading theory to explain why the exit polls were so 
far off this year.  NPR values   
said one ought to vote for Kerry.  So all the people who voted for
Kerry felt virtuous for doing so, and were eager to tell pollsters
they had. No one who voted for Kerry did it as an act of quiet
defiance.<br><br><!-- Imagine this scenario.  A husband and wife go to vote.  The wife
thinks Bush has made a mess in Iraq and that the family is worse   
off economically than a few years ago, and plans to vote for Kerry.
The husband thinks it's
great that America is finally kicking some ass, and sees in George
Bush a kind of cowboy figure that he likes to identify with.  Which
of the two is more likely to want to explain to a pollster why they
voted as they did?<br><br>--><br><br><br clear="all"></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="374"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="165"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/2005/Woman%20President.htm">Support for a Woman President</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="165"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/lionfan/20070127">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="374"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

the 1968 election.)</i>
-->
November 2004, corrected June 2006<br><br>Occam&apos;s razor says we should prefer the simpler of two explanations.
I begin by reminding readers of this principle because I&apos;m about
to propose a theory that will offend both liberals and conservatives.
But Occam&apos;s razor means, in effect, that if you want to disagree
with it, you have a hell of a coincidence to explain.<br><br>Theory: In US presidential elections, the more 
charismatic candidate wins.<br><br>People who write about politics, whether on the left or the right,
have a consistent bias: they take politics seriously.  When one
candidate beats another they look for political explanations.  The
country is shifting to the left, or the right.  And that sort of
shift can certainly be the result of a presidential election, which
makes it easy to believe it was the cause.<br><br>But when I think about why I voted for Clinton over the first George
Bush, it wasn&apos;t because I was shifting to the left.  Clinton just
seemed more dynamic.  He seemed to want the job more.  Bush seemed
old and tired.  I suspect it was the same for a lot of voters.<br><br>Clinton didn&apos;t represent any national shift leftward.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font>
He was
just more charismatic than George Bush or (God help us) Bob Dole.
In 2000 we practically got a controlled experiment to prove it:
Gore had Clinton&apos;s policies, but not his charisma, and he suffered
proportionally. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>
Same story in 2004. Kerry was smarter and more
articulate than Bush, but rather a stiff.  And Kerry lost.<br><br>As I looked further back, I kept finding the same pattern.  
Pundits said Carter beat Ford
because the country distrusted the Republicans after Watergate.
And yet it also happened that Carter was famous for his big grin
and folksy ways, and Ford for being a boring klutz.  Four years
later, pundits said the country had lurched to the right.  But
Reagan, a former actor, also happened to be even more charismatic
than Carter (whose grin was somewhat less cheery after four stressful
years in office).  In 1984 the charisma gap between Reagan and
Mondale was like that between Clinton and Dole, with similar results.
The first George Bush managed to win in 1988, though he would later
be vanquished by one of the most charismatic presidents ever, because
in 1988 he was up against the notoriously uncharismatic
Michael Dukakis.<br><br>These are the elections I remember personally, but apparently the
same pattern played out in 1964 and 1972.  The most recent
counterexample appears to be 1968, when Nixon beat the more charismatic Hubert
Humphrey.  But when you examine that election, it tends to support
the charisma theory more than contradict it.  As Joe McGinnis
recounts in his famous book <i>The Selling of the President 1968</i>,
Nixon knew he had less charisma than Humphrey, and thus simply
refused to debate him on TV.  He knew he couldn&apos;t afford to let the
two of them be seen side by side.<br><br>Now a candidate probably couldn&apos;t get away with refusing to debate.
But in 1968 the custom of televised debates was still evolving.  In
effect, Nixon won in 1968 because voters were never allowed to see
the real Nixon.  All they saw were carefully scripted campaign
spots.<br><br>Oddly enough, the most recent true counterexample is probably 1960.
Though this election is usually given as an example of the power
of TV, Kennedy apparently would not have won without fraud by party
machines in Illinois and Texas.  But TV was still young in 1960;
only 87% of households had it.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
Undoubtedly TV helped Kennedy,
so historians are correct in regarding this election as a
watershed.  TV required a new kind of candidate. There would be no
more Calvin Coolidges.<br><br>The charisma theory may also explain why Democrats tend to lose
presidential elections.  The core of the Democrats&apos; ideology seems
to be a belief in government.  Perhaps this tends to attract people
who are earnest, but dull.  Dukakis, Gore, and Kerry were so similar
in that respect that they might have been brothers.  Good thing for
the Democrats that their screen lets through an occasional Clinton,
even if some scandal results.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>One would like to believe elections are won and lost on issues, if
only fake ones like Willie Horton.  And yet, if they are, we have
a remarkable coincidence to explain.  In every presidential election
since TV became widespread, the apparently more charismatic candidate
has won.  Surprising, isn&apos;t it, that voters&apos; opinions on the issues
have lined up with charisma for 11 elections in a row?<br><br>The political commentators who come up with shifts to the left or
right in their morning-after analyses are like the financial reporters
stuck writing stories day after day about the random fluctuations
of the stock market.  Day ends, market closes up or down, reporter
looks for good or bad news respectively, and writes that the market
was up on news of Intel&apos;s earnings, or down on fears of instability
in the Middle East.  Suppose we could somehow feed these reporters
false information about market closes, but give them all the other
news intact.  Does anyone believe they would notice the anomaly,
and not simply write that stocks were up (or down) on whatever good
(or bad) news there was that day?  That they would say, hey, wait
a minute, how can stocks be up with all this unrest in the Middle
East?<br><br>I&apos;m not saying that issues don&apos;t matter to voters.  Of course they
do.  But the major parties know so well which issues matter how
much to how many voters, and adjust their message so precisely in
response, that they tend to split the difference on the issues,
leaving the election to be decided by the one factor they can&apos;t
control: charisma.<br><br>If the Democrats had been running a candidate as charismatic as
Clinton in the 2004 election, he&apos;d have won.  And we&apos;d be reading
that the election was a referendum on the war in Iraq, instead of
that the Democrats are out of touch with evangelical Christians in
middle America.<br><br>During the 1992 election, the Clinton campaign staff had a big sign
in their office saying &quot;It&apos;s the economy, stupid.&quot; Perhaps it was
even simpler than they thought.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Postscript</b><br><br>Opinions seem to be divided about the charisma theory.  Some say
it&apos;s impossible, others say it&apos;s obvious.  This seems a good sign.
Perhaps it&apos;s in the sweet spot midway between.<br><br>As for it being impossible, I reply: here&apos;s the data; here&apos;s the
theory; theory explains data 100%.   To a scientist, at least, that
means it deserves attention, however implausible it seems.<br><br>You can&apos;t believe voters are so superficial that they just choose
the most charismatic guy?  My theory doesn&apos;t require that.  I&apos;m not
proposing that charisma is the only factor, just that it&apos;s the only
one <i>left</i> after the efforts of the two parties cancel one
another out.<br><br>As for the theory being obvious, as far as I know, no one has
proposed it before.  Election forecasters are proud when they can
achieve the same results with much more complicated models.<br><br>Finally, to the people who say that the theory is probably true,
but rather depressing: it&apos;s not so bad as it seems.  The phenomenon
is like a pricing anomaly; once people realize it&apos;s there, it will
disappear.  Once both parties realize it&apos;s a waste of time to
nominate uncharismatic candidates, they&apos;ll tend to nominate only
the most charismatic ones.  And if the candidates are equally
charismatic, charisma will cancel out, and elections will be decided
on issues, as political commentators like to think they are now.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
As Clinton himself discovered to his surprise when, in one of
his first acts as president, he tried to shift the military leftward.
After a bruising fight he escaped with a face-saving compromise.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
True, Gore won the popular vote. But politicians know the electoral
vote decides the election, so that&apos;s what they campaign for. If Bush
had been campaigning for the popular vote he would presumably have
got more of it. (Thanks to judgmentalist for this point.)<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Source: Nielsen Media Research.  Of the remaining 13%, 11 didn&apos;t
have TV because they couldn&apos;t afford it.  I&apos;d argue that the missing
11% were probably also the 11% most susceptible to charisma.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
One implication of this theory is that parties shouldn&apos;t be too
quick to reject candidates with skeletons in their closets.
Charismatic candidates will tend to have more skeletons than squeaky
clean dullards, but in practice that doesn&apos;t seem to lose elections.
The current Bush, for example, probably did more drugs in his
twenties than any preceding president, and yet managed to get elected
with a base of evangelical Christians.  All you have to do is say
you&apos;ve reformed, and stonewall about the details.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Maria Daniels, Jessica Livingston,

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596006624">Hackers 
&amp; Painters</a>.
It tries to explain why Americans make some things well 
and others badly.)</i><br><br>A few years ago an Italian friend of mine travelled by train from
Boston to Providence.  She had only been in America for a
couple weeks and hadn&apos;t seen much of the country yet.  She arrived
looking astonished.  &quot;It&apos;s so <i>ugly!&quot;</i><br><br>People from other rich countries can scarcely imagine
the squalor of the man-made bits of America.  In travel books
they show you mostly natural environments: the Grand Canyon,
whitewater rafting, horses in a field.  If you see
pictures with man-made things in them, it will be either a
view of the New York skyline shot from a discreet distance,
or a carefully cropped image of a seacoast town in Maine.<br><br>How can it be, visitors must wonder.  How can the richest country
in the world look like this?<br><br>Oddly enough, it may not be a coincidence.  Americans are good
at some things and bad at others.  We&apos;re good at making
movies and software, and bad at making cars and cities.
And I think we may be good at what we&apos;re good at for the same
reason we&apos;re bad at what we&apos;re bad at.  We&apos;re impatient.
In America, if you want to do something, you don&apos;t worry that
it might come out badly, or upset delicate social balances, or
that people might think you&apos;re getting above yourself.  If you
want to do something, as Nike says, <i>just do it.</i><br><br><br><br>This works well in some fields and badly in others.  I suspect
it works in movies and software because they&apos;re both messy  
processes.  &quot;Systematic&quot;
is the last word I&apos;d use to describe the way 
<a href="gh.html">good programmers</a> write software.
Code is not something they assemble painstakingly after
careful planning, like the pyramids.  It&apos;s something they
plunge into, working fast and constantly changing their minds,
like a charcoal sketch.<br><br>In software, paradoxical
as it sounds, good craftsmanship means working fast.
If you work slowly and meticulously,
you merely end up with a very fine implementation of your initial,
mistaken idea.
Working slowly and meticulously is
premature optimization.  Better to get a
prototype done fast, and see what new ideas
it gives you.<br><br>It sounds like making movies works a lot like making software.
Every movie is a Frankenstein, full of imperfections
and usually quite different from what was originally envisioned.  
But interesting, and finished fairly quickly.  <!--If you tried to
make movies perfect, they'd never be done.--><br><br>I think we get away with this in movies and software
because they&apos;re both malleable mediums.  Boldness pays.
<!-- Nothing is
set in stone.  You can get away
with last minute changes.-->
And if at the last minute two parts don&apos;t quite   
fit, you can figure out some hack that will at least conceal
the problem.<br><br>Not so with cars, or cities.  They are all too physical.
If the car business worked like software or movies, you&apos;d
surpass your competitors by making a car that weighed only
fifty pounds, or folded up to the size of a motorcycle when   
you wanted to park it.  But with physical products there are
more constraints.  You don&apos;t win by dramatic innovations
so much as by good taste and attention to detail.<br><br>The trouble is, the very word &quot;taste&quot;
sounds slightly ridiculous to American ears.
It seems pretentious, or frivolous, or even effeminate.
Blue staters think it&apos;s &quot;subjective,&quot; and red staters 
think it&apos;s for sissies.  So anyone in America
who really cares about design will be sailing upwind.<br><br><br><br>Twenty years ago we used to hear that the problem with
the US car industry was the workers.
We don&apos;t hear that any more now that Japanese companies
are building cars in the US.   The problem with
American cars is bad design.  You can see that just by
looking at them.<br><br>All that extra sheet metal on the <a href="matador.html">AMC Matador</a> wasn&apos;t
added by the workers.  The problem
with this car, as with American cars today, is that it was
designed by marketing people instead of designers.<br><br>Why do the Japanese make better cars than us?  Some say it&apos;s
because their culture encourages cooperation.  That may come
into it.   But in this case it seems more to the point that
their culture prizes design and craftsmanship.<br><br>For centuries the Japanese have made finer things than we
have in the West.  When you look at swords they
made in 1200, you just can&apos;t believe the date on the label
is right.
Presumably their cars fit together more   
precisely than ours for the same reason their joinery always has.
They&apos;re obsessed with making things well.<br><br>Not us.
When we make something in America, our aim is just to get the   
job done.  Once we reach that point, we take one of two routes.
We can stop there, and have something crude but
serviceable, like a Vise-grip.  Or we can improve it,
which usually means encrusting it with gratuitous ornament.
When we want to make a car &quot;better,&quot;
we stick <a href="59eldorado.html">tail fins</a> on it, or make it 
<a href="75eldorado.html">longer</a>, or make the  
<a href="04magnum.html">windows smaller</a>, depending on the current fashion.<br><br>Ditto for houses.  In America you can have either a flimsy box banged
together out of two by fours and drywall, or a McMansion-- a
flimsy box banged together out of two by fours and drywall,
but larger, more dramatic-looking, and full of expensive fittings.
Rich people don&apos;t get better design or craftsmanship;
they just get a larger, more conspicuous version of the
standard house.<br><br>We don&apos;t especially prize design or craftsmanship here.  What
we like is speed, and we&apos;re willing to do something in an ugly
way to get it done fast.  In some
fields, like software or movies, this is a net win.  
<!-- But in
others, like cars or consumer electronics, it isn't.  --><br><br>But it&apos;s not just that software and movies are malleable mediums.
In those businesses, the designers (though they&apos;re
not generally called that) have more power.   
Software companies, at least successful ones, tend to be run
by programmers.  And in the film industry, though producers
may second-guess directors, the director controls most of
what appears on the screen.
And so American software and movies, and Japanese cars, all
have this in common: the people in charge care about
design-- the former because the designers are in charge, and the latter
because the whole culture cares about design.<br><br>I think most Japanese executives would be horrified at
the idea of making a bad car.  Whereas American executives,
in their hearts, still believe the most important thing about
a car is the image it projects.
Make a good car?  What&apos;s &quot;good?&quot;  It&apos;s so <i>subjective.</i>
If you want to know how to design a car, ask a focus group.<br><br>Instead of relying on their own internal design compass
(like Henry Ford did),
American car companies try to make what marketing people
think consumers want.  But it isn&apos;t working.  American cars continue
to lose market share.  And the reason is that the customer
doesn&apos;t want what he thinks he wants.<br><br>Letting focus groups design your cars for you  
only wins in the short term.  In the long term, it pays
to bet on good design.  The focus group may say they want the
meretricious feature du jour, but what they want even more is
to imitate sophisticated buyers, and they, though a
small minority, really do care about good design.
Eventually the
pimps and drug dealers notice that the doctors and lawyers
have switched from Cadillac to Lexus, and do the same.<br><br>Apple is an interesting counterexample to the general
American trend.  If you want to buy a nice CD player, you&apos;ll
probably buy a Japanese one.  But if you want to buy an
MP3 player, you&apos;ll probably buy an iPod.  What happened?
Why doesn&apos;t Sony dominate MP3 players?  Because Apple is
in the consumer electronics business now, and unlike
other American companies, they&apos;re obsessed with good design.  
Or more precisely, their CEO is.<br><br>I just got an iPod, and it&apos;s not just nice.  It&apos;s     
<i>surprisingly</i> nice.  For it to surprise me, it must be
satisfying expectations I didn&apos;t know I had.  No focus
group is going to discover those.  Only a great   
designer can.<br><br><br><br>Cars aren&apos;t the worst thing we make in America.
Where the just-do-it model fails most dramatically is in our cities-- or
rather, <a href="denver.html">exurbs</a>.
If real estate developers operated on a large enough scale, if
they built whole towns, market forces would compel
them to build towns that didn&apos;t suck.  But they only build a
couple office buildings or suburban streets at a time, and the
result is so depressing that the inhabitants consider it a great
treat to fly to Europe and spend a couple weeks living what
is, for people there, just everyday life. [1]<br><br>But the just-do-it model does have advantages.  It seems the clear
winner for generating wealth and technical innovations
(which are practically the same thing).  I think speed is the reason.
It&apos;s hard to create wealth by making a commodity.  The
real value is in things that are new, and if you want to
be the first to make something, it helps to work fast.
For better or worse, the just-do-it model is fast,
whether you&apos;re Dan Bricklin writing the prototype of VisiCalc in
a weekend, or a real estate developer
building a block of shoddy condos in a month.<br><br>If I had to choose between the just-do-it model and the
careful model, I&apos;d probably choose just-do-it.
But do we have to choose?  Could we have it both ways?
Could Americans have nice
places to live without undermining the impatient, individualistic spirit
that makes us good at software?  Could other countries
introduce more individualism into their technology companies
and research labs without having it metastasize as strip malls?
I&apos;m optimistic.  It&apos;s harder to
say about other countries, but in the US, at least, I think 
we can have both.<br><br>Apple is an encouraging example.  They&apos;ve managed to preserve
enough of the impatient, hackerly spirit you need to write
software.  And yet when
you pick up a new Apple laptop, well, it doesn&apos;t
seem American.  It&apos;s too perfect.  It seems as if it
must have been made by a Swedish or a Japanese company.<br><br>In many technologies, version 2 has higher resolution.  Why
not in design generally?  I think we&apos;ll gradually see
national characters superseded
by occupational characters: hackers in Japan will be allowed
to behave with a <a href="gba.html">willfulness</a> 
that would now seem unJapanese,
and products in America will be designed with an
insistence on <a href="taste.html">taste</a> that would now seem unAmerican.
Perhaps the most successful countries, in the future, will be
those most willing to ignore what are now considered
national characters, and do each kind of work in the way
that works best.  Race you.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] Japanese cities are ugly too, but for different reasons.
Japan is prone to earthquakes, so buildings are traditionally
seen as temporary; there is no grand tradition of  city planning
like the one Europeans inherited from Rome.  The other cause is
the notoriously corrupt relationship between the government
and construction companies.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Barry Eisler, Sarah Harlin,

high school.  I never actually 
gave it, because the school authorities vetoed the plan to invite me.)</i><br><br>When I said I was speaking at a high school, my friends were curious.
What will you say to high school students?  So I asked them, what
do you wish someone had told you in high school?  Their answers
were remarkably similar.  So I&apos;m going to tell you what we all wish
someone had told us.<br><br>I&apos;ll start by telling you something you don&apos;t have to know in high
school: what you want to do with your life.  People are always
asking you this, so you think you&apos;re supposed to have an answer.
But adults ask this mainly as a conversation starter.   They want
to know what sort of person you are, and this question is just to
get you talking.  They ask it the way you might poke a hermit crab
in a tide pool, to see what it does.<br><br>If I were back in high school and someone asked about my plans, I&apos;d
say that my first priority was to learn what the options were.  You
don&apos;t need to be in a rush to choose your life&apos;s work.  What you   
need to do is discover what you like.  You have to work on stuff  
you like if you want to be good at what you do.<br><br>It might seem that nothing would be easier than deciding what you
like, but it turns out to be hard, partly because it&apos;s hard to get
an accurate picture of most jobs.  Being a doctor is not the way
it&apos;s portrayed on TV.  Fortunately you can also watch real doctors,
by volunteering in hospitals. [1]<br><br>But there are other jobs you can&apos;t learn about, because no one is
doing them yet.  Most of the work I&apos;ve done in the last ten years
didn&apos;t exist when I was in high school.  The world changes fast,  
and the rate at which it changes is itself speeding up.  In such a
world it&apos;s not a good idea to have fixed plans.<br><br>And yet every May, speakers all over the country fire up the Standard 
Graduation Speech, the theme of which is: don&apos;t give up on your
dreams.  I know what they mean, but this is a bad way to put it,
because it implies you&apos;re supposed to be bound by some plan you
made early on.  The computer world has a name for this: premature
optimization.  And it is synonymous with disaster.  These speakers
would do better to say simply, don&apos;t give up.<br><br>What they really mean is, don&apos;t get demoralized.  Don&apos;t think that   
you can&apos;t do what other people can.   And I agree you shouldn&apos;t  
underestimate your potential.  People who&apos;ve done great things tend
to seem as if they were a race apart.  And most biographies only   
exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude   
biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how
the story ends, they can&apos;t help streamlining the plot till it seems
like the subject&apos;s life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding
of some innate genius.   In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen
year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they&apos;d seem
impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.<br><br>Which is an uncomfortable thought.  If they were just like us, then
they had to work very hard to do what they did.  And that&apos;s one  
reason we like to believe in genius.  It gives us an excuse for
being lazy.  If these guys were able to do what they did only because
of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it&apos;s not our
fault if we can&apos;t do something as good.<br><br>I&apos;m not saying there&apos;s no such thing as genius.  But if you&apos;re
trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse 
for being lazy, the other one is probably right.<br><br>So far we&apos;ve cut the Standard Graduation Speech down from &quot;don&apos;t
give up on your dreams&quot; to &quot;what someone else can do, you can do.&quot;
But it needs to be cut still further.  There is <i>some</i> variation
in natural ability.  Most people overestimate its role, but it does  
exist.  If I were talking to a guy four feet tall whose ambition 
was to play in the NBA, I&apos;d feel pretty stupid saying, you can
do anything if you really try. [2]<br><br>We need to cut the Standard Graduation Speech down to, &quot;what someone
else with your abilities can do, you can do; and don&apos;t underestimate
your abilities.&quot;  But as so often happens, the closer you get to
the truth, the messier your sentence gets.  We&apos;ve taken a nice, 
neat (but wrong) slogan, and churned it up like a mud puddle.  It
doesn&apos;t make a very good speech anymore.  But worse still, it doesn&apos;t
tell you what to do anymore.  Someone with your abilities?  What  
are your abilities?<br><br><b>Upwind</b><br><br>I think the solution is to work in the other direction.  Instead
of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations.
This is what most successful people actually do anyway.<br><br>In the graduation-speech approach, you decide where you want to be
in twenty years, and then ask: what should I do now to get there?  
I propose instead that you don&apos;t commit to anything in the future,
but just look at the options available now, and choose those that
will give you the most promising range of options afterward.<br><br>It&apos;s not so important what you work on, so long as you&apos;re not wasting
your time.  Work on things that interest you and increase your
options, and worry later about which you&apos;ll take.<br><br>Suppose you&apos;re a college freshman deciding whether to major in math   
or economics.  Well, math will give you more options: you can go into
almost any field from math.  If you major in math it will be easy
to get into grad school in economics, but if you major in economics
it will be hard to get into grad school in math.<br><br>Flying a glider is a good metaphor here.  Because a glider doesn&apos;t
have an engine, you can&apos;t fly into the wind without losing a lot
of altitude.  If you let yourself get far downwind of good places    
to land, your options narrow uncomfortably.  As a rule you want to
stay upwind.  So I propose that as a replacement for &quot;don&apos;t give   
up on your dreams.&quot;  Stay upwind.<br><br>How do you do that, though?  Even if math is upwind of economics,
how are you supposed to know that as a high school student?<br><br>Well, you don&apos;t, and that&apos;s what you need to find out.  <!-- I can give
you some tips on how to recognize upwind. --> Look for smart people
and hard problems.  Smart people tend to clump together, and if you
can find such a clump, it&apos;s probably worthwhile to join it.  But
it&apos;s not straightforward to find these, because there is a lot of  
faking going on.<br><br>To a newly arrived undergraduate, all university departments look
much the same.  The professors all seem forbiddingly intellectual
and publish papers unintelligible to outsiders.  But while in some
fields the papers are unintelligible because they&apos;re full of hard
ideas, in others they&apos;re deliberately written in an obscure way to
seem as if they&apos;re saying something important.  This may seem a   
scandalous proposition, but it has been experimentally verified,
in the famous <i>Social Text</i> affair.  Suspecting that the papers
published by literary theorists were often just intellectual-sounding
nonsense, a physicist deliberately wrote a paper full of
intellectual-sounding nonsense, and submitted it to a literary
theory journal, which published it.<br><br>The best protection is always to be working on hard problems.   
Writing novels is hard.  Reading novels isn&apos;t. 
Hard means worry: if you&apos;re not worrying that
something you&apos;re making will come out badly, or that you won&apos;t be 
able to understand something you&apos;re studying, then it isn&apos;t hard
enough.  There has to be suspense.<br><br>Well, this seems a grim view of the world, you may think.  What I&apos;m
telling you is that you should worry?  Yes, but it&apos;s not as bad as
it sounds.  It&apos;s exhilarating to overcome worries.  You don&apos;t see
faces much happier than people winning gold medals.  And you know
why they&apos;re so happy?  Relief.<br><br>I&apos;m not saying this is the only way to be happy.  Just that some
kinds of worry are not as bad as they sound.<br><br><b>Ambition</b><br><br>In practice, &quot;stay upwind&quot; reduces to &quot;work on hard problems.&quot;  And  
you can start today.  I wish I&apos;d grasped that in
high school.<br><br>Most people like to be good at what they do.  In the so-called real  
world this need is a powerful force.  But high school students
rarely benefit from it, because they&apos;re given a fake thing to do.  
When I was in high school, I let myself believe that my job was to 
be a high school student.  And so I let my need to be good at what 
I did be satisfied by merely doing well in school.<br><br>If you&apos;d asked me in high school what the difference was between
high school kids and adults, I&apos;d have said it was that adults had 
to earn a living.  Wrong.  It&apos;s that adults take responsibility for
themselves.  Making a living is only a small part of it.
Far more important is to take intellectual responsibility for oneself.<br><br>If I had to go through high school again, I&apos;d treat it like a day
job.  I don&apos;t mean that I&apos;d slack in school.  Working at something
as a day job doesn&apos;t mean doing it badly.  It means not being defined
by it.  I mean I wouldn&apos;t think of myself as a high school student,
just as a musician with a day job as a waiter doesn&apos;t think of   
himself as a waiter. [3]   And when I wasn&apos;t working at my day job
I&apos;d start trying to do real work.<br><br>When I ask people what they regret most about high school, they
nearly all say the same thing: that they wasted so much time.  If
you&apos;re wondering what you&apos;re doing now that you&apos;ll regret most
later, that&apos;s probably it. [4]<br><br>Some people say this is inevitable-- that high school students
aren&apos;t capable of getting anything done yet.  But I don&apos;t think
this is true.  And the proof is that you&apos;re bored.  You probably
weren&apos;t bored when you were eight.  When you&apos;re eight it&apos;s called
&quot;playing&quot; instead of &quot;hanging out,&quot; but it&apos;s the same thing.  And
when I was eight, I was rarely bored.  Give me a back yard and a
few other kids and I could play all day.<br><br>The reason this got stale in middle school and high school, I now
realize, is that I was ready for something else.  Childhood was
getting old.<br><br>I&apos;m not saying you shouldn&apos;t hang out with your friends-- that you
should all become humorless little robots who do nothing but work.
Hanging out with friends is like chocolate cake.  You enjoy it more
if you eat it occasionally than if you eat nothing but chocolate  
cake for every meal.  No matter how much you like chocolate cake,
you&apos;ll be pretty queasy after the third meal of it.  And that&apos;s  
what the malaise one feels in high school is: mental queasiness.
[5]<br><br>You may be thinking, we have to do more than get good grades.  We
have to have <i>extracurricular activities.</i>  But you know
perfectly well how bogus most of these are.  Collecting donations
for a charity is an admirable thing to do, but it&apos;s not <i>hard.</i>
It&apos;s not getting something done.  What I mean by getting something
done is learning how to write well, or how to program computers,
or what life was really like in preindustrial societies, or how to   
draw the human face from life.  This sort of thing rarely translates
into a line item on a college application.<br><br><b>Corruption</b><br><br>It&apos;s dangerous to design your life around getting into college,  
because the people you have to impress to get into college are not 
a very discerning audience.  At most colleges, it&apos;s not the professors
who decide whether you get in, but admissions officers, and they
are nowhere near as smart.  They&apos;re the NCOs of the intellectual
world. They can&apos;t tell how smart you are.
The mere existence of prep schools is proof of that.<br><br>Few parents
would pay so much for their kids to go to a school that didn&apos;t 
improve their admissions prospects.  Prep schools openly say this
is one of their aims.  But what that means, if you stop to 
think about it, is that they can
hack the admissions process: that they can take the very same kid
and make him seem a more appealing candidate than he would if he  
went to the local public school. [6]<br><br>Right now most of you feel your job in life is to be a promising
college applicant.  But that means you&apos;re designing your life to
satisfy a process so mindless that there&apos;s a whole industry devoted
to subverting it.  No wonder you become cynical.  The malaise you
feel is the same that a producer of reality TV shows or a tobacco 
industry executive feels.  And you don&apos;t even get paid a lot.<br><br>So what do you do?  What you should not do is rebel.  That&apos;s what
I did, and it was a mistake.  I didn&apos;t realize exactly what was   
happening to us, but I smelled a major rat.  And so I just gave up.
Obviously the world sucked, so why bother?<br><br>When I discovered that one of our teachers was herself using Cliff&apos;s
Notes, it seemed par for the course.  Surely it meant nothing to
get a good grade in such a class.<br><br>In retrospect this was stupid.  It was like someone getting fouled
in a soccer game and saying, hey, you fouled me, that&apos;s against the
rules, and walking off the field in indignation.  Fouls happen. 
The thing to do when you get fouled is not to lose your cool.  Just
keep playing.  <!-- Don't even foul the guy back; if you really want  
revenge, you'll make him more unhappy by winning the game than by
elbowing him in the jaw. --><br><br>By putting you in this situation, society has fouled you.   Yes, 
as you suspect, a lot of the stuff you learn in your classes is   
crap.  And yes, as you suspect, the college admissions process is
largely a charade.  But like many fouls, this one was unintentional.
[7] So just keep playing.<br><br>Rebellion is almost as stupid as obedience.  In either case you let
yourself be defined by what they tell you to do.  The best plan, I
think, is to step onto an orthogonal vector.  Don&apos;t just do what 
they tell you, and don&apos;t just refuse to.  Instead treat school as
a day job.  As day jobs go, it&apos;s pretty sweet.  You&apos;re done at 3
o&apos;clock, and you can even work on your own stuff while you&apos;re there.<br><br><b>Curiosity</b><br><br>And what&apos;s your real job supposed to be?  Unless you&apos;re Mozart,   
your first task is to figure that out.  What are the great things
to work on?  Where are the imaginative people?  And most importantly,
what are you interested in?  The word &quot;aptitude&quot; is misleading,
because it implies something innate.  The most powerful sort of
aptitude is a consuming interest in some question, and such interests
are often acquired tastes.<br><br>A distorted version of this idea has filtered into popular culture
under the name &quot;passion.&quot;  I recently saw an ad for waiters saying
they wanted people with a &quot;passion for service.&quot;  The real thing 
is not something one could have for waiting on tables.  And passion
is a bad word for it. A better name would be curiosity.<br><br>Kids are curious, but the curiosity I mean has a different shape from kid
curiosity.  Kid curiosity is broad and shallow; they ask why at
random about everything.  In most adults this curiosity dries up
entirely.  It has to: you can&apos;t get anything done if you&apos;re always
asking why about everything.  But in ambitious adults, instead of
drying up, curiosity becomes narrow and deep.  The mud flat morphs
into a well.<br><br>Curiosity turns work into play.  For Einstein, relativity wasn&apos;t a
book full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam.  It was a
mystery he was trying to solve.  So it probably felt like less work
to him to invent it than it would seem to someone now to learn it
in a class.<br><br>One of the most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea
that doing great things requires a lot of discipline.  Most subjects
are taught in such a boring way that it&apos;s only by discipline that
you can flog yourself through them.  So I was surprised when, early
in college, I read a quote by Wittgenstein saying that he had no 
self-discipline and had never been able to deny himself anything, 
not even a cup of coffee.<br><br>Now I know a number of people who do great work, and it&apos;s the same
with all of them.  They have little discipline.  They&apos;re all terrible
procrastinators and find it almost impossible to make themselves
do anything they&apos;re not interested in.  One still hasn&apos;t sent out
his half of the thank-you notes from his wedding, four years ago.
Another has 26,000 emails in her inbox.<br><br>I&apos;m not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline.  You 
probably need about the amount you need to go running.  I&apos;m often  
reluctant to go running, but once I do, I enjoy it.  And if I don&apos;t  
run for several days, I feel ill.  It&apos;s the same with people who 
do great things.  They know they&apos;ll feel bad if they don&apos;t work,
and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks
to start working.  But once they get started, interest takes over,
and discipline is no longer necessary.<br><br>Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently
trying to write Great Literature?  Of course not.  He was having
fun.  That&apos;s why he&apos;s so good.<br><br>If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity   
about a promising question.   The critical moment for Einstein
was when he looked at Maxwell&apos;s equations and said, what the hell
is going on here?<br><br>It can take years to zero in on a productive question, because it
can take years to figure out what a subject is really about.  To
take an extreme example, consider math.  Most people think they
hate math, but the boring stuff you do in school under the name
&quot;mathematics&quot; is not at all like what mathematicians do.<br><br>The great mathematician G. H.  Hardy said he didn&apos;t like math in 
high school either.  He only took it up because he was better at
it than the other students.  Only later did he realize math was
interesting-- only later did he start to ask questions instead of
merely answering them correctly.<br><br>When a friend of mine used to grumble because he had to write a
paper for school, his mother would tell him: find a way to make it
interesting.  That&apos;s what you need to do: find a question that makes
the world interesting.  People who do great things look at the same
world everyone else does, but notice some odd detail that&apos;s
compellingly mysterious.<br><br>And not only in intellectual matters.  Henry Ford&apos;s great question 
was, why do cars have to be a luxury item?  What would happen if
you treated them as a commodity?  Franz Beckenbauer&apos;s was, in effect,
why does everyone have to stay in his position?  Why can&apos;t defenders
score goals too?<br><br><b>Now</b><br><br>If it takes years to articulate great questions, what do you do now,
at sixteen?  Work toward finding one.  Great questions don&apos;t appear
suddenly.  They gradually congeal in your head.  And what makes
them congeal is experience.  So the way to find great questions is
not to search for them-- not to wander about thinking, what great  
discovery shall I make?  You can&apos;t answer that; if you could, you&apos;d 
have made it.<br><br>The way to get a big idea to appear in your head is not to hunt for
big ideas, but to put in a lot of time on work that interests you,
and in the process keep your mind open enough that a big idea can
take roost.  Einstein, Ford, and Beckenbauer all used this recipe.
They all knew their work like a piano player knows the keys.  So  
when something seemed amiss to them, they had the confidence to
notice it.<br><br>Put in time how and on what?  Just pick a project that seems
interesting: to master some chunk of material, or to make something,
or to answer some question.  Choose a project that will take less
than a month, and make it something you have the means to finish.
Do something hard enough to stretch you, but only just, especially 
at first.  If you&apos;re deciding between two projects, choose whichever 
seems most fun. If one blows up in your face, start another.  Repeat
till, like an internal combustion engine, the process becomes   
self-sustaining, and each project generates the next one.  (This
could take years.)<br><br>It may be just as well not to do a project &quot;for school,&quot; if that
will restrict you or make it seem like work.  Involve your friends
if you want, but not too many, and only if they&apos;re not flakes.  
Friends offer moral support (few startups are started by one person),
but secrecy also has its advantages.  There&apos;s something pleasing
about a secret project.  And you can take more risks, because no  
one will know if you fail.<br><br>Don&apos;t worry if a project doesn&apos;t seem to be on the path to some
goal you&apos;re supposed to have. Paths can bend a lot more than you
think.  So let the path grow out the project.  The most important
thing is to be excited about it, because it&apos;s by doing that you 
learn.<br><br>Don&apos;t disregard unseemly motivations.  One of the most powerful is
the desire to be better than other people at something.  Hardy said
that&apos;s what got him started, and I think the only unusual thing  
about him is that he admitted it.  Another powerful motivator is
the desire to do, or know, things you&apos;re not supposed to.  Closely
related is the desire to do something audacious.  Sixteen year olds
aren&apos;t supposed to write novels.  So if you try, anything you achieve
is on the plus side of the ledger; if you fail utterly, you&apos;re doing
no worse than expectations.  [8]<br><br>Beware of bad models.  Especially when they excuse laziness.  When  
I was in high school I used to write &quot;existentialist&quot; short stories
like ones I&apos;d seen by famous writers.  My stories didn&apos;t have a lot
of plot, but they were very deep.  And they were less work to write
than entertaining ones would have been.  I should have known that
was a danger sign.  And in fact I found my stories pretty boring;  
what excited me was the idea of writing serious, intellectual stuff
like the famous writers.<br><br>Now I have enough experience to realize that those famous writers
actually sucked.  Plenty of famous people do; in the short term,
the quality of one&apos;s work is only a small component of fame.  
I should have been less worried about doing something
that seemed cool, and just done something I liked.  That&apos;s the
actual road to coolness anyway.<br><br>A key ingredient in many projects, almost a project on its own, is 
to find good books.  Most books are bad.  Nearly all textbooks are
bad. [9]  So don&apos;t assume a subject is to be learned from whatever
book on it happens to be closest.  You have to search actively for 
the tiny number of good books.<br><br>The important thing is to get out there and do stuff.  Instead of
waiting to be taught, go out and learn.<br><br>Your life doesn&apos;t have to be shaped by admissions officers.  It  
could be shaped by your own curiosity.  It is for all ambitious   
adults.  And you don&apos;t have to wait to start.  In fact, you don&apos;t 
have to wait to be an adult.  There&apos;s no switch inside you that
magically flips when you turn a certain age or graduate from some
institution.  You start being an adult when you decide to take
responsibility for your life.  You can do that at any age.  [10]<br><br>This may sound like bullshit.  I&apos;m just a minor, you may think, I
have no money, I have to live at home, I have to do what adults  
tell me all day long.  Well, most adults labor under restrictions  
just as cumbersome, and they manage to get things done.  If you
think it&apos;s restrictive being a kid, imagine having kids.<br><br>The only real difference between adults and high school kids is
that adults realize they need to get things done, and high school
kids don&apos;t.  That realization hits most people around 23.  But I&apos;m
letting you in on the secret early.  So get to work.  Maybe you can
be the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn&apos;t
how much time you wasted.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] A doctor friend warns that even this can give an inaccurate 
picture. &quot;Who knew how much time it would take up, how little
autonomy one would have for endless years of training, and how
unbelievably annoying it is to carry a beeper?&quot;<br><br>[2] His best bet would probably be to become dictator and intimidate
the NBA into letting him play.  So far the closest anyone has come
is Secretary of Labor.<br><br>[3] A day job is one you take to pay the bills so you can do what
you really want, like play in a band, or invent relativity.<br><br>Treating high school as a day job might actually make it easier for
some students to get good grades.  If you treat your classes
as a game, you won&apos;t be demoralized if they seem pointless.<br><br>However bad your classes, you need to get good grades in them to   
get into a decent college.  And that <i>is</i> worth doing, because
universities are where a lot of the clumps of smart people are these
days.<br><br>[4] The second biggest regret was caring so much about unimportant
things.  And especially about what other people thought of them.<br><br>I think what they really mean, in the latter case, is caring what
random people thought of them.  Adults care just as much what other
people think, but they get to be more selective about the other
people.<br><br>I have about thirty friends whose opinions I care about,
and the opinion of the rest of the world barely affects me.  The
problem in high school is that your peers are chosen for you by    
accidents of age and geography, rather than by you based on respect
for their judgement.<br><br>[5] The key to wasting time is distraction.  Without distractions
it&apos;s too obvious to your brain that you&apos;re not doing anything with
it, and you start to feel uncomfortable.  If you want to measure 
how dependent you&apos;ve become on distractions, try this experiment:
set aside a chunk of time on a weekend and sit alone and think.
You can have a notebook to write your thoughts down in, but nothing
else: no friends, TV, music, phone, IM, email, Web, games, books, 
newspapers, or magazines.  Within an hour most people will feel a 
strong craving for distraction.<br><br>[6] I don&apos;t mean to imply that the only function of prep schools
is to trick admissions officers.  They also generally provide a 
better education.  But try this thought experiment: suppose prep
schools supplied the same superior education but had a tiny (.001)
negative effect on college admissions.  How many parents would still
send their kids to them?<br><br>It might also be argued that kids who went to prep schools, because
they&apos;ve learned more, <i>are</i> better college candidates.  But
this seems empirically false.  What you learn in even the best high
school is rounding error compared to what you learn in college.  
Public school kids arrive at college with a slight disadvantage,  
but they start to pull ahead in the sophomore year.<br><br>(I&apos;m not saying public school kids are smarter than preppies, just
that they are within any given college.  That follows necessarily
if you agree prep schools improve kids&apos; admissions prospects.)<br><br>[7] Why does society foul you?  Indifference, mainly.  There are
simply no outside forces pushing high school to be good.  The air
traffic control system works because planes would crash otherwise.
Businesses have to deliver because otherwise competitors would take
their customers.  But no planes crash if your school sucks, and it
has no competitors.  High school isn&apos;t evil; it&apos;s random; but random
is pretty bad.<br><br>[8] And then of course there is money.  It&apos;s not a big factor in
high school, because you can&apos;t do much that anyone wants.  But a
lot of great things were created mainly to make money.  Samuel
Johnson said &quot;no man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money.&quot;
(Many hope he was exaggerating.)<br><br>[9] Even college textbooks are bad.  When you get to college,
you&apos;ll find that (with a few stellar exceptions) the textbooks are
not written by the leading scholars in the field they describe.
Writing college textbooks is unpleasant work, done mostly by people
who need the money.  It&apos;s unpleasant because the publishers exert
so much control, and there are few things worse than close supervision
by someone who doesn&apos;t understand what you&apos;re doing.  This phenomenon
is apparently 
<a href="http://www.edutopia.org/muddle-machine">even worse</a> in the production of high school textbooks.<br><br>[10] Your teachers are always telling you to behave like adults.
I wonder if they&apos;d like it if you did.  You may be loud and
disorganized, but you&apos;re very docile compared to adults.  If you
actually started acting like adults, it would be just as if a bunch
of adults had been transposed into your bodies.  Imagine the reaction
of an FBI agent or taxi driver or reporter to being told they had
to ask permission to go the bathroom, and only one person could go
at a time.  To say nothing of the things you&apos;re taught.  If a bunch
of actual adults suddenly found themselves trapped in high school,
the first thing they&apos;d do is form a union and renegotiate all the
rules with the administration.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Ingrid Bassett, Trevor Blackwell,

<p>
March 2005<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at the Harvard Computer
Society.)</i><br><br>You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with
good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend
as little money as possible.  Most startups that fail do it because
they fail at one of these.  A startup that does all three will
probably succeed.<br><br>And that&apos;s kind of exciting, when you think about it, because all
three are doable.  Hard, but doable.  And since a startup that
succeeds ordinarily makes its founders rich, that implies getting
rich is doable too.  Hard, but doable.<br><br>If there is one message I&apos;d like to get across about startups,
that&apos;s it.  There is no magically difficult step that requires
brilliance to solve.<br><br><b>The Idea</b><br><br>In particular, you don&apos;t need a brilliant 
<a href="ideas.html">idea</a> to start a startup
around.   The way a startup makes money is to offer people better
technology than they have now.  But what people have now is often
so bad that it doesn&apos;t take brilliance to do better.<br><br>Google&apos;s plan, for example, was simply to create a search site that
didn&apos;t suck.  They had three new ideas: index more of the Web, use
links to rank search results, and have clean, simple web pages with
unintrusive keyword-based ads.  Above all, they were determined to
make a site that was good to use.  No doubt there are great technical
tricks within Google, but the overall plan was straightforward.
And while they probably have bigger ambitions now, this alone brings
them a billion dollars a year. [1]<br><br>There are plenty of other areas that are just as backward as search
was before Google.  I can think of several heuristics for generating
ideas for startups, but most reduce to this: look at something
people are trying to do, and figure out how to do it in a way that
doesn&apos;t suck.<br><br>For example, dating sites currently suck far worse than search did
before Google.  They all use the same simple-minded model.
They seem to have approached the problem by thinking about how to
do database matches instead of how dating works in the real world.
An undergrad could build something better as a class project.  And
yet there&apos;s a lot of money at stake.  Online dating is a valuable
business now, and it might be worth a hundred times as much if it
worked.<br><br>An idea for a startup, however, is only a beginning.  A lot of
would-be startup founders think the key to the whole process is the
initial idea, and from that point all you have to do is execute.
Venture capitalists know better.  If you go to VC firms with a
brilliant idea that you&apos;ll tell them about if they sign a nondisclosure
agreement, most will tell you to get lost.   That shows how much a 
mere idea is worth. The market price is less than the inconvenience 
of signing an NDA.<br><br>Another sign of how little the initial idea is worth is the number
of startups that change their plan en route. Microsoft&apos;s original
plan was to make money selling programming languages, of all things.
Their current business model didn&apos;t occur to them until IBM dropped
it in their lap five years later.<br><br>Ideas for startups are worth something, certainly, but the trouble
is, they&apos;re not transferrable.  They&apos;re not something you could
hand to someone else to execute.  Their value is mainly as starting
points: as questions for the people who had them to continue thinking
about.<br><br>What matters is not ideas, but the people who have them.  Good
people can fix bad ideas, but good ideas can&apos;t save bad people.  
<!-- So let's talk about people. --><br><br><b>People</b><br><br>What do I mean by good people?  One of the best tricks I learned   
during <a href="road.html">our</a> startup was a rule for deciding 
who to hire.  Could you
describe the person as an animal?  It might be hard to translate   
that into another language, but I think everyone in the US knows  
what it means.  It means someone who takes their work a little too   
seriously; someone who does what they do so well that they pass
right through professional and cross over into obsessive.<br><br>What it means specifically depends on the job: a salesperson who
just won&apos;t take no for an answer; a hacker who will stay up till   
4:00 AM rather than go to bed leaving code with a bug in it; a PR   
person who will cold-call <i>New York Times</i> reporters on their cell
phones; a graphic designer who feels physical pain when something 
is two millimeters out of place.<br><br>Almost everyone who worked for us was an animal at what they did. 
The woman in charge of sales was so tenacious that I used to feel
sorry for potential customers on the phone with her.  You could  
sense them squirming on the hook, but you knew there would be no  
rest for them till they&apos;d signed up.<br><br>If you think about people you know, you&apos;ll find the animal test is
easy to apply.  Call the person&apos;s image to mind and imagine the
sentence &quot;so-and-so is an animal.&quot;  If you laugh, they&apos;re not.  You
don&apos;t need or perhaps even want this quality in big companies, but
you need it in a startup.<br><br>For programmers we had three additional tests.  Was the person
genuinely smart?  If so, could they actually get things done?  And
finally, since a few good hackers have unbearable personalities,   
could we stand to have them around?<br><br>That last test filters out surprisingly few people.  We could bear
any amount of nerdiness if someone was truly smart.  What we couldn&apos;t
stand were people with a lot of attitude.  But most of those weren&apos;t
truly smart, so our third test was largely a restatement of the
first.<br><br>When nerds are unbearable it&apos;s usually because they&apos;re trying too
hard to seem smart.  But the smarter they are, the less pressure
they feel to act smart.  So as a rule you can recognize genuinely
smart people by their ability to say things like &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot;   
&quot;Maybe you&apos;re right,&quot; and &quot;I don&apos;t understand x well enough.&quot;<br><br>This technique doesn&apos;t always work, because people can be influenced
by their environment.  In the MIT CS department, there seems to be
a tradition of acting like a brusque know-it-all. I&apos;m told it derives
ultimately from Marvin Minsky, in the same way the classic airline
pilot manner is said to derive from Chuck Yeager.  Even genuinely
smart people start to act this way there, so you have to make
allowances.<br><br>It helped us to have Robert Morris, who is one of the readiest to
say &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot; of anyone I&apos;ve met.  (At least, he was before he 
became a professor at MIT.)  No one dared put on attitude around   
Robert, because he was obviously smarter than they were and yet had
zero attitude himself.<br><br>Like most startups, ours began with a group of friends, and it was
through personal contacts that we got most of the people we hired.
This is a crucial difference between startups and big companies.
Being friends with someone for even a couple days will tell you 
more than companies could ever learn in interviews.  [2]<br><br>It&apos;s no coincidence that startups start around universities, because
that&apos;s where smart people meet.  It&apos;s not what people learn in    
classes at MIT and Stanford that has made technology companies
spring up around them.  They could sing campfire songs in the classes
so long as admissions worked the same.<br><br>If you start a startup, there&apos;s a good chance it will be with people
you know from college or grad school.  So in theory you ought to  
try to make friends with as many smart people as you can in school,
right?  Well, no.  Don&apos;t make a conscious effort to schmooze; that
doesn&apos;t work well with hackers.<br><br>What you should do in college is work on your own projects.  Hackers
should do this even if they don&apos;t plan to start startups, because 
it&apos;s the only real way to learn how to program.   In some cases you
may collaborate with other students, and this is the best way to
get to know good hackers.  The project may even grow into a startup.
But once again, I wouldn&apos;t aim too directly at either target.  Don&apos;t
force things; just work on stuff you like with people you like.<br><br>Ideally you want between two and four founders.  It would be hard
to start with just one.  One person would find the moral weight of
starting a company hard to bear.  Even Bill Gates, who seems to be   
able to bear a good deal of moral weight, had to have a co-founder. 
But you don&apos;t want so many founders that the company starts to look
like a group photo.  Partly because you don&apos;t need a lot of people
at first, but mainly because the more founders you have, the worse
disagreements you&apos;ll have. When there are just two or three founders,
you know you have to resolve disputes immediately or perish.  If
there are seven or eight, disagreements can linger and harden into
factions.  You don&apos;t want mere voting; you need unanimity.<br><br>In a technology startup, which most startups are, the founders
should include technical people.   During the Internet Bubble there 
were a number of startups founded by business people who then went
looking for hackers to create their product for them.  This doesn&apos;t  
work well.  Business people are bad at deciding what to do with   
technology, because they don&apos;t know what the options are, or which
kinds of problems are hard and which are easy.  And when business
people try to hire hackers, they can&apos;t tell which ones are 
<a href="gh.html">good</a>.
Even other hackers have a hard time doing that. 
For business people it&apos;s roulette.<br><br>Do the founders of a startup have to include business people?  That
depends.  We thought so when we started ours, and we asked several 
people who were said to know about this mysterious thing called
&quot;business&quot; if they would be the president.  But they all said no,
so I had to do it myself.  And what I discovered was that business
was no great mystery.   It&apos;s not something like physics or medicine
that requires extensive study.  You just try to get people to pay
you for stuff.<br><br>I think the reason I made such a mystery of business was that I was
disgusted by the idea of doing it.  I wanted to work in the pure,   
intellectual world of software, not deal with customers&apos; mundane  
problems.  People who don&apos;t want to get dragged into some kind of
work often develop a protective incompetence at it.  Paul Erdos was
particularly good at this.  By seeming unable even to cut a grapefruit
in half (let alone go to the store and buy one), he forced other
people to do such things for him, leaving all his time free for
math.  Erdos was an extreme case, but most husbands use the same  
trick to some degree.<br><br>Once I was forced to discard my protective incompetence, I found
that business was neither so hard nor so boring as I feared.  There
are esoteric areas of business that are quite hard, like tax law
or the pricing of derivatives, but you don&apos;t need to know about   
those in a startup.  All you need to know about business to run a  
startup are commonsense things people knew before there were business
schools, or even universities.<br><br>If you work your way down the Forbes 400 making an x next to the   
name of each person with an MBA, you&apos;ll learn something important
about business school.  After Warren Buffett, you don&apos;t hit another 
MBA till number 22,
Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike.  There are only 5 MBAs in the top
50.  What you notice in the Forbes 400 are a lot of people with      
technical backgrounds.  Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison,
Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore.  The rulers of the technology
business tend to come from technology, not business.  So if you   
want to invest two years in something that will help you succeed  
in business, the evidence suggests you&apos;d do better to learn how to   
hack than get an MBA. [3]<br><br>There is one reason you might want to include business people in a
startup, though: because you have to have at least one person willing
and able to focus on what customers want. Some believe only business
people can do this-- that hackers can implement software, but not   
design it.  That&apos;s nonsense.  There&apos;s nothing about knowing how to
program that prevents hackers from understanding users, or about
not knowing how to program that magically enables business people 
to understand them.<br><br>If you can&apos;t understand users, however, you should either learn how
or find a co-founder who can.  That is the single most important
issue for technology startups, and the rock that sinks more of them
than anything else.<br><br><b>What Customers Want</b><br><br>It&apos;s not just startups that have to worry about this.  I think most
businesses that fail do it because they don&apos;t give customers what
they want.  Look at restaurants.  A large percentage fail, about a
quarter in the first year.  But can you think of one restaurant
that had really good food and went out of business?<br><br>Restaurants with great food seem to prosper no matter what.  A    
restaurant with great food can be expensive, crowded, noisy, dingy,
out of the way, and even have bad service, and people will keep
coming.  It&apos;s true that a restaurant with mediocre food can sometimes 
attract customers through gimmicks.  But that approach is very  
risky.  It&apos;s more straightforward just to make the food good.<br><br>It&apos;s the same with technology.  You hear all kinds of reasons why
startups fail.  But can you think of one that had a massively popular
product and still failed?<br><br>In nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customers
didn&apos;t want the product.  For most, the cause of death is listed  
as &quot;ran out of funding,&quot; but that&apos;s only the immediate cause.  Why 
couldn&apos;t they get more funding?  Probably because the product was
a dog, or never seemed likely to be done, or both.<br><br>When I was trying to think of the things every startup needed to   
do, I almost included a fourth: get a version 1 out as soon as you
can.  But I decided not to, because that&apos;s implicit in making
something customers want.  The only way to make something customers
want is to get a prototype in front of them and refine it based on   
their reactions.<br><br>The other approach is what I call the &quot;Hail Mary&quot; strategy.  You  
make elaborate plans for a product, hire a team of engineers to   
develop it (people who do this tend to use the term &quot;engineer&quot; for   
hackers), and then find after a year that you&apos;ve spent two million
dollars to develop something no one wants.  This was not uncommon
during the Bubble, especially in companies run by business types, 
who thought of software development as something terrifying that
therefore had to be carefully planned.<br><br>We never even considered that approach.  As a Lisp hacker, I come 
from the tradition of rapid prototyping.  I would not claim (at
least, not here) that this is the right way to write every program,
but it&apos;s certainly the right way to write software for a startup.
In a startup, your initial plans are almost certain to be wrong in
some way, and your first priority should be to figure out where.   
The only way to do that is to try implementing them.<br><br>Like most startups, we changed our plan on the fly.  At first we
expected our customers to be Web consultants.  But it turned out
they didn&apos;t like us, because our software was easy to use and we hosted
the site.  It would be too easy for clients to fire them.  We also
thought we&apos;d be able to sign up a lot of catalog companies, because
selling online was a natural extension of their existing business.
But in 1996 that was a hard sell.  The middle managers we talked   
to at catalog companies saw the Web not as an opportunity, but as
something that meant more work for them.<br><br>We did get a few of the more adventurous catalog companies.  Among
them was Frederick&apos;s of Hollywood, which gave us valuable experience
dealing with heavy loads on our servers.  But most of our users   
were small, individual merchants who saw the Web as an opportunity 
to build a business.  Some had retail stores, but many only existed
online.  And so we changed direction to focus on these users.
Instead of concentrating on the features Web consultants and catalog
companies would want, we worked to make the software easy to use.<br><br>I learned something valuable from that.  It&apos;s worth trying very, 
very hard to make technology easy to use.  Hackers are so used to
computers that they have no idea how horrifying software seems to
normal people.  Stephen Hawking&apos;s editor told him that every equation
he included in his book would cut sales in half.  When you work on
making technology easier to use, you&apos;re riding that curve up instead  
of down. A 10% improvement in ease of use doesn&apos;t just increase    
your sales 10%.  It&apos;s more likely to double your sales.<br><br>How do you figure out what customers want?  Watch them.  One of the
best places to do this was at trade shows.  Trade shows didn&apos;t pay 
as a way of getting new customers, but they were worth it as market
research.  We didn&apos;t just give canned presentations at trade shows.
We used to show people how to build real, working stores.  Which   
meant we got to watch as they used our software, and talk to them    
about what they needed.<br><br>No matter what kind of startup you start, it will probably be a   
stretch for you, the founders, to understand what users want.  The
only kind of software you can build without studying users is the    
sort for which you are the typical user.  But this is just the kind
that tends to be open source: operating systems, programming
languages, editors, and so on.  So if you&apos;re developing technology
for money, you&apos;re probably not going to be developing it for people
like you.  Indeed, you can use this as a way to generate ideas for
startups: what do people who are not like you want from technology?<br><br>When most people think of startups, they think of companies like
Apple or Google.  Everyone knows these, because they&apos;re big consumer
brands.  But for every startup like that, there are twenty more  
that operate in niche markets or live quietly down in the infrastructure.
So if you start a successful startup, odds are you&apos;ll start one of 
those.<br><br>Another way to say that is, if you try to start the kind of startup
that has to be a big consumer brand, the odds against succeeding
are steeper.  The best odds are in niche markets.  Since startups  
make money by offering people something better than they had before,
the best opportunities are where things suck most.  And it would   
be hard to find a place where things suck more than in corporate  
IT departments.  You would not believe the amount of money companies
spend on software, and the crap they get in return.  This imbalance
equals opportunity.<br><br>If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things you
could do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a  
couple weeks just watching what they do with computers.  Most good
hackers have no more idea of the horrors perpetrated in these places
than rich Americans do of what goes on in Brazilian slums.<br><br>Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it&apos;s easier
to sell to them.  It&apos;s worth so much to sell stuff to big companies
that the people selling them the crap they currently use spend a
lot of time and money to do it.  And while you can outhack Oracle
with one frontal lobe tied behind your back, you can&apos;t outsell an
Oracle salesman.  So if you want to win through better technology,
aim at smaller customers.  [4]<br><br>They&apos;re the more strategically valuable part of the market anyway.    
In technology, the low end always eats the high end.  It&apos;s easier  
to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful
product cheaper.  So the products that start as cheap, simple options
tend to gradually grow more powerful till, like water rising in a  
room, they squash the &quot;high-end&quot; products against the ceiling.  Sun
did this to mainframes, and Intel is doing it to Sun.  Microsoft
Word did it to desktop publishing software like Interleaf and
Framemaker.  Mass-market digital cameras are doing it to the expensive
models made for professionals.  Avid did it to the manufacturers     
of specialized video editing systems, and now Apple is doing it to
Avid.  <i>Henry Ford</i> did it to the car makers that preceded
him.  If you build the simple, inexpensive option, you&apos;ll not only
find it easier to sell at first, but you&apos;ll also be in the best   
position to conquer the rest of the market.<br><br>It&apos;s very dangerous to let anyone fly under you.  If you have the
cheapest, easiest product, you&apos;ll own the low end.  And if you
don&apos;t, you&apos;re in the crosshairs of whoever does.<br><br><b>Raising Money</b><br><br>To make all this happen, you&apos;re going to need money.  Some startups
have been self-funding-- Microsoft for example-- but most aren&apos;t.
I think it&apos;s wise to take money from investors.  To be self-funding,
you have to start as a consulting company, and it&apos;s hard to switch
from that to a product company.<br><br>Financially, a startup is like a pass/fail course.  The way to get
rich from a startup is to maximize the company&apos;s chances of succeeding,
not to maximize the amount of stock you retain.  So if you can trade
stock for something that improves your odds, it&apos;s probably a smart 
move.<br><br>To most hackers, getting investors seems like a terrifying and
mysterious process.  Actually it&apos;s merely tedious.  I&apos;ll try to
give an outline of how it works.<br><br>The first thing you&apos;ll need is a few tens of thousands of dollars   
to pay your expenses while you develop a prototype.  This is called
seed capital.  Because so little money is involved, raising seed
capital is comparatively easy-- at least in the sense of getting a
quick yes or no.<br><br>Usually you get seed money from individual rich people called
&quot;angels.&quot; Often they&apos;re people who themselves got rich from technology.
At the seed stage, investors don&apos;t expect you to have an elaborate
business plan.  Most know that they&apos;re supposed to decide quickly.
It&apos;s not unusual to get a check within a week based on a half-page
agreement.<br><br>We started Viaweb with $10,000 of seed money from our friend Julian.
But he gave us a lot more than money.  He&apos;s a former CEO and also
a corporate lawyer, so he gave us a lot of valuable advice about
business, and also did all the legal work of getting us set up as
a company.  Plus he introduced us to one of the two 
angel investors who supplied our next round of funding.<br><br>Some angels, especially those with technology backgrounds, may be     
satisfied with a demo and a verbal description of what you plan to 
do.  But many will want a copy of your business plan, if only to
remind themselves what they invested in.<br><br>Our angels asked for one, and looking back, I&apos;m amazed how much
worry it caused me.  &quot;Business plan&quot; has that word &quot;business&quot; in
it, so I figured it had to be something I&apos;d have to read a book
about business plans to write.  Well, it doesn&apos;t.  At this stage,
all most investors expect is a brief description of what you plan    
to do and how you&apos;re going to make money from it, and the resumes 
of the founders.  If you just sit down and write out what you&apos;ve
been saying to one another, that should be fine.  It shouldn&apos;t take
more than a couple hours, and you&apos;ll probably find that writing it
all down gives you more ideas about what to do.<br><br>For the angel to have someone to make the check out to, you&apos;re going
to have to have some kind of company.  Merely incorporating yourselves
isn&apos;t hard.  The problem is, for the company to exist, you have to
decide who the founders are, and how much stock they each have.  If
there are two founders with the same qualifications who are both
equally committed to the business, that&apos;s easy.  But if you have a
number of people who are expected to contribute in varying degrees,
arranging the proportions of stock can be hard.  And once you&apos;ve
done it, it tends to be set in stone.<br><br>I have no tricks for dealing with this problem.  All I can say is,
try hard to do it right.  I do have a rule of thumb for recognizing
when you have, though.  When everyone feels they&apos;re getting a
slightly bad deal, that they&apos;re doing more than they should for the
amount of stock they have, the stock is optimally apportioned.<br><br>There is more to setting up a company than incorporating it, of
course: insurance, business license, unemployment compensation,    
various things with the IRS.  I&apos;m not even sure what the list is,
because we, ah, skipped all that.  When we got real funding near
the end of 1996, we hired a great CFO, who fixed everything   
retroactively.  It turns out that no one comes and arrests you if
you don&apos;t do everything you&apos;re supposed to when starting a company.
And a good thing too, or a lot of startups would never get started.
[5]<br><br>It can be dangerous to delay turning yourself into a company, because
one or more of the founders might decide to split off and start   
another company doing the same thing.  This does happen.  So when
you set up the company, as well as as apportioning the stock, you
should get all the founders to sign something agreeing that everyone&apos;s
ideas belong to this company, and that this company is going to be
everyone&apos;s only job.<br><br>[If this were a movie, ominous music would begin here.]<br><br>While you&apos;re at it, you should ask what else they&apos;ve signed.  One
of the worst things that can happen to a startup is to run into       
intellectual property problems.  We did, and it came closer to 
killing us than any competitor ever did.<br><br>As we were in the middle of getting bought, we discovered that one
of our people had, early on, been bound by an agreement that said
all his ideas belonged to the giant company that was paying for him
to go to grad school.  In theory, that could have meant someone
else owned big chunks of our software.  So the acquisition came to
a screeching halt while we tried to sort this out.  The problem      
was, since we&apos;d been about to be acquired, we&apos;d allowed ourselves 
to run low on cash.  Now we needed to raise more to keep going. 
But it&apos;s hard to raise money with an IP cloud over your head, because
investors can&apos;t judge how serious it is.<br><br>Our existing investors, knowing that we needed money and had nowhere
else to get it, at this point attempted certain gambits which I
will not describe in detail, except to remind readers that the word   
&quot;angel&quot; is a metaphor.  The founders thereupon proposed to walk   
away from the company, after giving the investors a brief tutorial 
on how to administer the servers themselves.  And while this was
happening, the acquirers used the delay as an excuse to welch on  
the deal.<br><br>Miraculously it all turned out ok.  The investors backed down; we
did another round of funding at a reasonable valuation; the giant
company finally gave us a piece of paper saying they didn&apos;t own our
software; and six months later we were bought by Yahoo for much
more than the earlier acquirer had agreed to pay.  So we were happy
in the end, though the experience probably took several years off  
my life.<br><br>Don&apos;t do what we did.  Before you consummate a startup, ask 
everyone about their previous IP history.<br><br>Once you&apos;ve got a company set up, it may seem presumptuous to go
knocking on the doors of rich people and asking them to invest tens
of thousands of dollars in something that is really just a bunch 
of guys with some ideas.  But when you look at it from the rich
people&apos;s point of view, the picture is more encouraging. Most rich 
people are looking for good investments.  If you really think you
have a chance of succeeding, you&apos;re doing them a favor by letting
them invest.  Mixed with any annoyance they might feel about being   
approached will be the thought: are these guys the next Google?<br><br>Usually angels are financially equivalent to founders.  They get 
the same kind of stock and get diluted the same amount in future
rounds.  How much stock should they get?  That depends on how
ambitious you feel.  When you offer x percent of your company for
y dollars, you&apos;re implicitly claiming a certain value for the whole
company.  Venture investments are usually described in terms of
that number.  If you give an investor new shares equal to 5% of
those already outstanding in return for $100,000, then you&apos;ve done
the deal at a pre-money valuation of $2 million.<br><br>How do you decide what the value of the company should be?  There
is no rational way.  At this stage the company is just a bet.  I
didn&apos;t realize that when we were raising money.  Julian
thought we ought to value the company at several million 
dollars.  I thought it was preposterous to claim that a couple
thousand lines of code, which was all we had at the time, were worth
several million dollars.  Eventually we settled on one millon,
because Julian said no one would invest in a company with a valuation
any lower. [6]<br><br>What I didn&apos;t grasp at the time was that the valuation wasn&apos;t just   
the value of the code we&apos;d written so far.  It was also the value
of our ideas, which turned out to be right, and of all the future
work we&apos;d do, which turned out to be a lot.<br><br>The next round of funding is the one in which you might deal with 
actual 
<a href="venturecapital.html">venture capital firms</a>.  
But don&apos;t wait till you&apos;ve burned   
through your last round of funding to start approaching them.  VCs are slow to
make up their minds.  They can take months.  You don&apos;t want to be 
running out of money while you&apos;re trying to negotiate with them.<br><br>Getting money from an actual VC firm is a bigger deal than getting
money from angels.  The amounts of money involved are larger, millions
usually.  So the deals take longer, dilute you more, and impose
more onerous conditions.<br><br>Sometimes the VCs want to install a new CEO of their own choosing. 
Usually the claim is that you need someone mature and experienced,
with a business background.  Maybe in some cases this is true.   And
yet Bill Gates was young and inexperienced and had no business 
background, and he seems to have done ok.  Steve Jobs got booted
out of his own company by someone mature and experienced, with a
business background, who then proceeded to ruin the company.  So I
think people who are mature and experienced, with a business
background, may be overrated.  We used to call these guys &quot;newscasters,&quot;
because they had neat hair and spoke in deep, confident voices, and
generally didn&apos;t know much more than they read on the teleprompter.<br><br>We talked to a number of VCs, but eventually we ended up financing
our startup entirely with angel money.  The main reason was that     
we feared a brand-name VC firm would stick us with a newscaster as
part of the deal.  That might have been ok if he was content to
limit himself to talking to the press, but what if he wanted to  
have a say in running the company?   That would have led to disaster,
because our software was so complex.  We were a company whose whole
m.o. was to win through better technology.  The strategic decisions
were mostly decisions about technology, and we didn&apos;t need any help
with those.<br><br>This was also one reason we didn&apos;t go public.  Back in 1998 our CFO
tried to talk me into it.  In those days you could go public as a
dogfood portal, so as a company with a real product and real revenues,
we might have done well.  But I feared it would have meant taking
on a newscaster-- someone who, as they say, &quot;can talk Wall Street&apos;s
language.&quot;<br><br>I&apos;m happy to see Google is bucking that trend.  They didn&apos;t talk
Wall Street&apos;s language when they did their IPO, and Wall Street
didn&apos;t buy.  And now Wall Street is collectively kicking itself.
They&apos;ll pay attention next time.  Wall Street learns new languages   
fast when money is involved.<br><br>You have more leverage negotiating with VCs than you realize.  The   
reason is other VCs.  I know a number of VCs now, and when you talk
to them you realize that it&apos;s a seller&apos;s market.  Even now there
is too much money chasing too few good deals.<br><br>VCs form a pyramid.  At the top are famous ones like Sequoia and
Kleiner Perkins, but beneath those are a huge number you&apos;ve never 
heard of.  What they all have in common is that a dollar from them 
is worth one dollar.  Most VCs will tell you that they don&apos;t just 
provide money, but connections and advice.  If you&apos;re talking to  
Vinod Khosla or John Doerr or Mike Moritz, this is true.  But such
advice and connections can come very expensive.  And as you go down
the food chain the VCs get rapidly 
<!-- href="http://ricksegal.typepad.com/pmv/2005/03/vcs_suck_shocki.html"-->
dumber.  A few steps down from 
the top you&apos;re basically talking to bankers who&apos;ve picked up a few
new vocabulary words from reading <i>Wired</i>.  (Does your product
use <i>XML?</i>)  So I&apos;d advise you to be skeptical about claims
of experience and connections.  Basically, a VC is a source of
money.  I&apos;d be inclined to go with whoever offered the most money  
the soonest with the least strings attached.<br><br>You may wonder how much to tell VCs.  And you should, because some
of them may one day be funding your competitors.  I think the best
plan is not to be overtly secretive, but not to tell them everything
either.  After all, as most VCs say, they&apos;re more interested in the
people than the ideas.  The main reason they want to talk about
your idea is to judge you, not the idea.  So as long as you seem
like you know what you&apos;re doing, you can probably keep a few things
back from them. [7]<br><br>Talk to as many VCs as you can, even if you don&apos;t want their money,
because a) they may be on the board of someone who will buy you,     
and b) if you seem impressive, they&apos;ll be discouraged from investing
in your competitors.  The most efficient way to reach VCs, especially
if you only want them to know about you and don&apos;t want their money,
is at the conferences that are occasionally organized for startups   
to present to them.<br><br><b>Not Spending It</b><br><br>When and if you get an infusion of real money from investors, what
should you do with it?  Not spend it, that&apos;s what.  In nearly every   
startup that fails, the proximate cause is running out of money. 
Usually there is something deeper wrong.  But even a proximate cause
of death is worth trying hard to avoid.<br><br>During the Bubble many startups tried to &quot;get big fast.&quot; Ideally
this meant getting a lot of customers fast.  But it was easy for
the meaning to slide over into hiring a lot of people fast.<br><br>Of the two versions, the one where you get a lot of customers fast
is of course preferable.  But even that may be overrated.  The idea
is to get there first and get all the users, leaving none for
competitors.  But I think in most businesses the advantages of being
first to market are not so overwhelmingly great.  Google is again
a case in point.  When they appeared it seemed as if search was a
mature market, dominated by big players who&apos;d spent millions to
build their brands: Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Infoseek, Altavista,  
Inktomi.  Surely 1998 was a little late to arrive at the party.<br><br>But as the founders of Google knew, brand is worth next to nothing
in the search business.  You can come along at any point and make 
something better, and users will gradually seep over to you.  As  
if to emphasize the point, Google never did any advertising.  They&apos;re
like dealers; they sell the stuff, but they know better than to use
it themselves.<br><br>The competitors Google buried would have done better to spend those
millions improving their software.  Future startups should learn
from that mistake.  Unless you&apos;re in a market where products are   
as undifferentiated as cigarettes or vodka or laundry detergent,
spending a lot on brand advertising is a sign of breakage.  And few
if any Web businesses are so undifferentiated.  The dating sites  
are running big ad campaigns right now, which is all the 
more evidence they&apos;re ripe for the picking.  (Fee, fie, fo, fum, I  
smell a company run by marketing guys.)<br><br>We were compelled by circumstances to grow slowly, and in retrospect
it was a good thing.  The founders all learned to do every job in  
the company.  As well as writing software, I had to do sales and
customer support.  At sales I was not very good.  I was persistent,
but I didn&apos;t have the smoothness of a good salesman.  My message   
to potential customers was: you&apos;d be stupid not to sell online, and  
if you sell online you&apos;d be stupid to use anyone else&apos;s software.   
Both statements were true, but that&apos;s not the way to convince people.<br><br>I was great at customer support though.  Imagine talking to a
customer support person who not only knew everything about the
product, but would apologize abjectly if there was a bug, and then
fix it immediately, while you were on the phone with them.  Customers
loved us.  And we loved them, because when you&apos;re growing slow by
word of mouth, your first batch of users are the ones who were smart
enough to find you by themselves.  There is nothing more valuable,
in the early stages of a startup, than smart users.  If you listen
to them, they&apos;ll tell you exactly how to make a winning product.      
And not only will they give you this advice for free, they&apos;ll pay
you.<br><br>We officially launched in early 1996.  By the end of that year we
had about 70 users.  Since this was the era of &quot;get big fast,&quot; I
worried about how small and obscure we were.  But in fact we were
doing exactly the right thing.  Once you get big (in users or
employees) it gets hard to change your product.  That year was
effectively a laboratory for improving our software.  By the end  
of it, we were so far ahead of our competitors that they never had 
a hope of catching up.  And since all the hackers had spent many
hours talking to users, we understood online commerce way better
than anyone else.<br><br>That&apos;s the key to success as a startup.  There is nothing more 
important than understanding your business.  You might think that
anyone in a business must, ex officio, understand it.  Far from it.   
Google&apos;s secret
weapon was simply that they understood search.  I was working for 
Yahoo when Google appeared, and Yahoo didn&apos;t understand search.  I
know because I once tried to convince the powers that be that we
had to make search better, and I got in reply what was then the
party line about it: that Yahoo was no longer a mere &quot;search engine.&quot;
Search was now only a small percentage of our page views, less than
one month&apos;s growth, and now that we were established as a &quot;media   
company,&quot; or &quot;portal,&quot; or whatever we were, search could safely be
allowed to wither and drop off, like an umbilical cord.<br><br>Well, a small fraction of page views they may be, but they are an  
important fraction, because they are the page views that Web sessions  
start with.  I think Yahoo gets that now.<br><br>Google understands a few other things most Web companies still
don&apos;t.  The most important is that you should put users before
advertisers, even though the advertisers are paying and users aren&apos;t.
One of my favorite bumper stickers reads &quot;if the people lead, the  
leaders will follow.&quot; Paraphrased for the Web, this becomes &quot;get
all the users, and the advertisers will follow.&quot;  More generally,
design your product to please users first, and then think about how
to make money from it.  If you don&apos;t put users first, you leave a    
gap for competitors who do.<br><br>To make something users love, you have to understand them.  And the
bigger you are, the harder that is.  So I say &quot;get big slow.&quot; The
slower you burn through your funding, the more time you have to
learn.<br><br>The other reason to spend money slowly is to encourage a culture 
of cheapness.  That&apos;s something Yahoo did understand.  David Filo&apos;s 
title was &quot;Chief Yahoo,&quot; but he was proud that his unofficial title
was &quot;Cheap Yahoo.&quot;  Soon after we arrived at Yahoo, we got an email
from Filo, who had been crawling around our directory hierarchy,      
asking if it was really necessary to store so much of our data on
expensive RAID drives.  I was impressed by that.  Yahoo&apos;s market
cap then was already in the billions, and they were still worrying
about wasting a few gigs of disk space.<br><br>When you get a couple million dollars from a VC firm, you tend to
feel rich.  It&apos;s important to realize you&apos;re not.  A rich company
is one with large revenues.  This money isn&apos;t revenue.  It&apos;s money
investors have given you in the hope you&apos;ll be able to generate   
revenues.  So despite those millions in the bank, you&apos;re still poor.<br><br>For most startups the model should be grad student, not law firm.
Aim for cool and cheap, not expensive and impressive.  For us the
test of whether a startup understood this was whether they had Aeron
chairs.  The Aeron came out during the Bubble and was very popular
with startups.  Especially the type, all too common then, that was
like a bunch of kids playing house with money supplied by VCs.   We   
had office chairs so cheap that the arms all fell off.  This was 
slightly embarrassing at the time, but in retrospect the grad-studenty
atmosphere of our office was another of those things we did right 
without knowing it.<br><br>Our offices were in a wooden triple-decker in Harvard Square.  It
had been an apartment until about the 1970s, and there was still a   
claw-footed bathtub in the bathroom.  It must once have been inhabited
by someone fairly eccentric, because a lot of the chinks in the    
walls were stuffed with aluminum foil, as if to protect against   
cosmic rays.  When eminent visitors came to see us, we were a bit
sheepish about the low production values.  But in fact that place
was the perfect space for a startup.  We felt like our role was to 
be impudent underdogs instead of corporate stuffed shirts, and that    
is exactly the spirit you want.<br><br>An apartment is also the right kind of place for developing software.
Cube farms suck for that, as you&apos;ve probably discovered if you&apos;ve
tried it.  Ever notice how much easier it is to hack at home than
at work?  So why not make work more like home?<br><br>When you&apos;re looking for space for a startup, don&apos;t feel that it has
to look professional.  Professional means doing good work, not
elevators and glass walls.  I&apos;d advise most startups to avoid
corporate space at first and just rent an apartment.  You want to
live at the office in a startup, so why not have a place designed
to be lived in as your office?<br><br>Besides being cheaper and better to work in, apartments tend to be
in better locations than office buildings.  And for a startup
location is very important.  The key to productivity is for people
to come back to work after dinner.  Those hours after the phone
stops ringing are by far the best for getting work done.  Great
things happen when a group of employees go out to dinner together, 
talk over ideas, and then come back to their offices to implement  
them.  So you want to be in a place where there are a lot of
restaurants around, not some dreary office park that&apos;s a wasteland
after 6:00 PM.  Once a company shifts over into the model where 
everyone drives home to the suburbs for dinner, however late, you&apos;ve
lost something extraordinarily valuable.  God help you if you
actually start in that mode.<br><br>If I were going to start a startup today, there are only three   
places I&apos;d consider doing it: on the Red Line near Central, Harvard,
or Davis Squares (Kendall is too sterile); in Palo Alto on University
or California Aves; and in Berkeley immediately north or south of   
campus.  These are the only places I know that have the right kind
of vibe.<br><br>The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people.  
I may be an extremist, but I think hiring people is the worst thing
a company can do.  To start with, people are a recurring expense, 
which is the worst kind.  They also tend to cause you to grow out     
of your space, and perhaps even move to the sort of uncool office
building that will make your software worse.  But worst of all,
they slow you down: instead of sticking your head in someone&apos;s    
office and checking out an idea with them, eight people have to
have a meeting about it.  So the fewer people you can hire, the
better.<br><br>During the Bubble a lot of startups had the opposite policy.  They
wanted to get &quot;staffed up&quot; as soon as possible, as if you couldn&apos;t 
get anything done unless there was someone with the corresponding 
job title.  That&apos;s big company thinking.  Don&apos;t hire people to fill
the gaps in some a priori org chart.  The only reason to hire someone
is to do something you&apos;d like to do but can&apos;t.<br><br>If hiring unnecessary people is expensive and slows you down, why
do nearly all companies do it?  I think the main reason is that
people like the idea of having a lot of people working for them.
This weakness often extends right up to the CEO.  If you ever end
up running a company, you&apos;ll find the most common question people
ask is how many employees you have.  This is their way of weighing
you.  It&apos;s not just random people who ask this; even reporters do.
And they&apos;re going to be a lot more impressed if the answer is a
thousand than if it&apos;s ten.<br><br>This is ridiculous, really.  If two companies have the same revenues,
it&apos;s the one with fewer employees that&apos;s more impressive.  When  
people used to ask me how many people our startup had, and I answered
&quot;twenty,&quot; I could see them thinking that we didn&apos;t count for much.
I used to want to add &quot;but our main competitor, whose ass we regularly
kick, has a hundred and forty, so can we have credit for the larger
of the two numbers?&quot;<br><br>As with office space, the number of your employees is a choice 
between seeming impressive, and being impressive.  Any of you who  
were <a href="nerds.html">nerds</a> in high school know about this 
choice.  Keep doing it when you start a company.<br><br><b>Should You?</b><br><br>But should you start a company?  Are you the right sort of person
to do it?  If you are, is it worth it?<br><br>More people are the right sort of person to start a startup than
realize it.  That&apos;s the main reason I wrote this.  There could be   
ten times more startups than there are, and that would probably be
a good thing.<br><br>I was, I now realize, exactly the right sort of person to start a   
startup.  But the idea terrified me at first.  I was forced into   
it because I was a <a href="icad.html">Lisp</a> hacker.  The company
I&apos;d been consulting for seemed to be running into trouble, and there  
were not a lot of other companies using Lisp.  Since I couldn&apos;t  
bear the thought of programming in another language (this was 1995,
remember, when &quot;another language&quot; meant C++) the only option seemed
to be to start a new company using Lisp.<br><br>I realize this sounds far-fetched, but if you&apos;re a Lisp hacker
you&apos;ll know what I mean.  And if the idea of starting a startup
frightened me so much that I only did it out of necessity, there  
must be a lot of people who would be good at it but who are too    
intimidated to try.<br><br>So who should start a startup?  Someone who is a good hacker, between
about 23 and 38, and who wants to solve the money problem in one
shot instead of getting paid gradually over a conventional working
life.<br><br>I can&apos;t say precisely what a good hacker is.  At a first rate   
university this might include the top half of computer science   
majors.  Though of course you don&apos;t have to be a CS major to be a
hacker; I was a philosophy major in college.<br><br>It&apos;s hard to tell whether you&apos;re a good hacker, especially when
you&apos;re young.  Fortunately the process of starting startups tends
to select them automatically.  What drives people to start startups
is (or should be) looking at existing technology and thinking, don&apos;t 
these guys realize they should be doing x, y, and z?  And that&apos;s 
also a sign that one is a good hacker.<br><br>I put the lower bound at 23 not because there&apos;s something that
doesn&apos;t happen to your brain till then, but because you need to see
what it&apos;s like in an existing business before you try running your
own.  The business doesn&apos;t have to be a startup.  I spent a year
working for a software company to pay off my college loans.  It was
the worst year of my adult life, but I learned, without realizing  
it at the time, a lot of valuable lessons about the software business.
In this case they were mostly negative lessons: don&apos;t have a lot
of meetings; don&apos;t have chunks of code that multiple people own;
don&apos;t have a sales guy running the company; don&apos;t make a high-end
product; don&apos;t let your code get too big; don&apos;t leave finding bugs
to QA people; don&apos;t go too long between releases; don&apos;t isolate
developers from users; don&apos;t move from Cambridge to Route 128; and
so on. [8] But negative lessons are just as valuable as positive 
ones.  Perhaps even more valuable: it&apos;s hard to repeat a brilliant
performance, but it&apos;s straightforward to avoid errors. [9]<br><br>The other reason it&apos;s hard to start a company before 23 is that     
people won&apos;t take you seriously.  VCs won&apos;t trust you, and will try
to reduce you to a mascot as a condition of funding.  Customers
will worry you&apos;re going to flake out and leave them stranded.  Even
you yourself, unless you&apos;re very unusual, will feel your age to     
some degree; you&apos;ll find it awkward to be the boss of someone much 
older than you, and if you&apos;re 21, hiring only people younger rather 
limits your options.<br><br>Some people could probably start a company at 18 if they wanted to.
Bill Gates was 19 when he and Paul Allen started Microsoft.  (Paul 
Allen was 22, though, and that probably made a difference.) So if
you&apos;re thinking, I don&apos;t care what he says, I&apos;m going to start a
company now, you may be the sort of person who could get away with
it.<br><br>The other cutoff, 38, has a lot more play in it.  One reason I put 
it there is that I don&apos;t think many people have the physical stamina
much past that age.   I used to work till 2:00 or 3:00 AM every
night, seven days a week.  I don&apos;t know if I could do that now.<br><br>Also,
startups are a big risk financially.  If you try something that
blows up and leaves you broke at 26, big deal; a lot of 26 year
olds are broke.  By 38 you can&apos;t take so many risks-- especially
if you have kids.<br><br>My final test may be the most restrictive.  Do you actually want
to start a startup?  What it amounts to, economically, is compressing
your working life into the smallest possible space.  Instead of
working at an ordinary rate for 40 years, you work like hell for 
four.  And maybe end up with nothing-- though in that case it
probably won&apos;t take four years.<br><br>During this time you&apos;ll do little but work, because when you&apos;re not
working, your competitors will be.  My only leisure activities were
running, which I needed to do to keep working anyway, and about
fifteen minutes of reading a night.  I had a girlfriend for a total
of two months during that three year period.  Every couple weeks I
would take a few hours off to visit a used bookshop or go to a  
friend&apos;s house for dinner.  I went to visit my family twice.
Otherwise I just worked.<br><br>Working was often fun, because the people I worked with were some
of my best friends.  Sometimes it was even technically interesting.
But only about 10% of the time.  The best I can say for the other
90% is that some of it is funnier in hindsight than it seemed then.
Like the time the power went off in Cambridge for about six hours,
and we made the mistake of trying to start a gasoline powered
generator inside our offices. I won&apos;t try that again.<br><br>I don&apos;t think the amount of bullshit you have to deal with in a
startup is more than you&apos;d endure in an ordinary working life.  It&apos;s
probably less, in fact; it just seems like a lot because it&apos;s       
compressed into a short period.  So mainly what a startup buys you 
is time.  That&apos;s the way to think about it if you&apos;re trying to 
decide whether to start one.  If you&apos;re the sort of person who would
like to solve the money problem once and for all instead of working 
for a salary for 40 years, then a startup makes sense.<br><br>For a lot of people the conflict is between startups and graduate
school.  Grad students are just the age, and just the sort of people,
to start software startups.  You may worry that if you do you&apos;ll   
blow your chances of an academic career.  But it&apos;s possible to be  
part of a startup and stay in grad school, especially at first.  
Two of our three original hackers were in grad school the whole 
time, and both got their <a href="tlbphd.html">degrees</a>. 
There are few sources of energy
so powerful as a procrastinating grad student.<br><br>If you do have to
leave grad school, in the worst case it won&apos;t be for too long.  If
a startup fails, it will probably fail quickly enough that you can 
return to academic life.  And if it succeeds, you may find you no   
longer have such a burning desire to be an assistant professor.<br><br>If you want to do it, do it.  Starting a startup is not the great
mystery it seems from outside.  It&apos;s not something you have to know
about &quot;business&quot; to do.  Build something users love, and spend less
than you make.  How hard is that?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] Google&apos;s revenues are about two billion a year, but half comes
from ads on other sites.<br><br>[2] One advantage startups have over established companies is that
there are no discrimination laws about starting businesses.  For   
example, I would be reluctant to start a startup with a woman
who had small children, or was likely to have them soon.  But you&apos;re
not allowed to ask prospective employees if they plan to have kids 
soon.  Believe it or not, under current US law, you&apos;re not even   
allowed to discriminate on the basis of intelligence.  Whereas when
you&apos;re starting a company, you can discriminate on any basis you
want about who you start it with.<br><br>[3] Learning to hack is a lot cheaper than business school, because
you can do it mostly on your own.  For the price of a Linux box, a
copy of K&amp;R, and a few hours of advice from your neighbor&apos;s fifteen
year old son, you&apos;ll be well on your way.<br><br>[4] Corollary: Avoid starting a startup to sell things to the biggest
company of all, the government.  Yes, there are lots of opportunities
to sell them technology.  But let someone else start those startups.<br><br>[5] A friend who started a company in Germany told me they do care 
about the paperwork there, and that there&apos;s more of it.  Which helps
explain why there are not more startups in Germany.<br><br>[6] At the seed stage our valuation was in principle $100,000, because
Julian got 10% of the company.  But this is a very misleading number,
because the money was the least important of the things Julian gave us.<br><br>[7] The same goes for companies that seem to want to acquire you.
There will be a few that are only pretending to in order to pick
your brains.  But you can never tell for sure which these are, so
the best approach is to seem entirely open, but to fail to mention
a few critical technical secrets.<br><br>[8]  I was as bad an employee as this place was a company.  I
apologize to anyone who had to work with me there.<br><br>[9]  You could probably write a book about how to succeed in business
by doing everything in exactly the opposite way from the DMV.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston,

interested in being a &quot;technologist in residence&quot; at a new venture
capital fund.  I think the idea was to play Karl Rove to the VCs&apos;
George Bush.<br><br>I considered it for about four seconds.  Work for a VC fund?  Ick.<br><br>One of my most vivid memories from our startup is going to visit
Greylock, the famous Boston VCs. They were the most arrogant
people I&apos;ve met in my life.  And I&apos;ve met a lot of arrogant people.
[1]<br><br>I&apos;m not alone in feeling this way, of course.  Even a VC friend of
mine dislikes VCs.  &quot;Assholes,&quot; he says.<br><br>But lately I&apos;ve been learning more about how the VC world works,
<!--(mostly in order to <a href="summerfounder.html">hack it</a>)-->
and a few days ago it hit me that there&apos;s a reason VCs are the way
they are.  It&apos;s not so much that the business attracts jerks, or
even that the power they wield corrupts them.  The real problem is
the way they&apos;re paid.<br><br>The problem with VC funds is that they&apos;re <i>funds</i>.  Like the
managers of mutual funds or hedge funds, VCs get paid a percentage
of the money they manage: about 2% a year in management fees,
plus a percentage of the gains.  So they want
the fund to be huge-- hundreds of millions of dollars, if possible.
But that means each partner ends up being responsible for investing
a lot of money.  And since one person can only manage so many deals,
each deal has to be for multiple millions of dollars.<br><br>This turns out to explain nearly all the characteristics of VCs
that founders hate.<br><br>It explains why VCs take so agonizingly long to make up their minds,
and why their due diligence feels like a body cavity search. [2]
With so much at stake, they have to be paranoid.<br><br>It explains why they steal your ideas.  Every founder knows that
VCs will tell your secrets to your competitors if they end up
investing in them.  It&apos;s not unheard of for VCs to meet you when
they have no intention of funding you, just to pick your brain for
a competitor.  This prospect makes naive founders clumsily secretive.
Experienced founders treat it as a cost of doing business.  Either
way it sucks.  But again, the only reason VCs are so sneaky is the
giant deals they do.  With so much at stake, they have to be devious.<br><br>It explains why VCs tend to interfere in the companies they invest
in.  They want to be on your board not just so that they can advise
you, but so that they can watch you.  Often they even install a new
CEO.  Yes, he may have extensive business experience.  But he&apos;s
also their man: these newly installed CEOs always play something  
of the role of a political commissar in a Red Army unit.  With
so much at stake, VCs can&apos;t resist micromanaging you.<br><br>The huge investments themselves are something founders would dislike,
if they realized how damaging they can be.  VCs don&apos;t invest $x
million because that&apos;s the amount you need, but because that&apos;s the
amount the structure of their business requires them to invest.  
Like steroids, these sudden huge investments can do more harm than 
good.  Google survived enormous VC funding because it could
legitimately absorb large amounts of money.  They had to buy a lot
of servers and a lot of bandwidth to crawl the whole Web.  Less
fortunate startups just end up hiring armies of people to sit around
having meetings.<br><br>In principle you could take a huge VC investment, put it in treasury
bills, and continue to operate frugally.  You just try it.<br><br>And of course giant investments mean giant valuations.  They have
to, or there&apos;s not enough stock left to keep the founders interested.
You might think a high valuation is a great thing.  Many founders 
do.  But you can&apos;t eat paper.  You can&apos;t benefit from a high valuation
unless you can somehow achieve what those in the business 
<!-- (with no apparent embarrassment)-->
call a &quot;liquidity event,&quot; and the higher   
your valuation, the narrower your options for doing that.  Many a   
founder would be happy to sell his company for $15 million, but VCs
who&apos;ve just invested at a pre-money valuation of $8 million won&apos;t
hear of that.  You&apos;re rolling the dice again, whether you like it
or not.<br><br>Back in 1997, one of our competitors raised $20 million in a single 
round of VC funding.  This was at the time more than the valuation
of our entire company.  Was I worried?  Not at all: I was delighted.
It was like watching a car you&apos;re chasing turn down a street that
you know has no outlet.<br><br>Their smartest move at that point would have been to take every 
penny of the $20 million and use it to buy us.  We would have sold.
Their investors would have been furious of course.  But I think the  
main reason they never considered this was that they never imagined
we could be had so cheap.  They probably assumed we were on the
same VC gravy train they were.<br><br>In fact we only spent about $2 million in our entire existence.   
And that gave us flexibility.  We could sell ourselves to Yahoo for
$50 million, and everyone was delighted.  If our competitor had
done that, the last round of investors would presumably have lost
money.  I assume they could have vetoed such a deal.  But no one  
those days was paying a lot more than Yahoo.  So unless their
founders could pull off an IPO (which would be difficult with Yahoo
as a competitor), they had no choice but to ride the thing down.<br><br>The puffed-up companies that went public during the Bubble didn&apos;t
do it just because they were pulled into it by unscrupulous investment 
bankers.  Most were pushed just as hard from the other side by VCs
who&apos;d invested at high valuations, leaving an IPO as the only way  
out.  The only people dumber were retail investors.  So it was
literally IPO or bust.  Or rather, IPO then bust, or just bust.<br><br>Add up all the evidence of VCs&apos; behavior, and the resulting personality
is not attractive.  In fact, it&apos;s the classic villain: alternately
cowardly, greedy, sneaky, and overbearing.<br><br>I used to take it for granted that VCs were like this. Complaining  
that VCs were jerks used to seem as naive to me as complaining that
users didn&apos;t read the reference manual.  Of course VCs were jerks.
How could it be otherwise?<br><br>But I realize now that they&apos;re not intrinsically jerks.  VCs are  
like car salesmen or bureaucrats: the nature of their work
turns them into jerks.<br><br>I&apos;ve met a few VCs I like.  Mike Moritz seems a good guy.  He even 
has a sense of humor, which is almost unheard of among VCs.  From  
what I&apos;ve read about John Doerr, he sounds like a good guy too,  
almost a hacker.  But they work for the very best VC funds.  And 
my theory explains why they&apos;d tend to be different: just as the
very most popular kids don&apos;t have to persecute 
<a href="nerds.html">nerds</a>, the very best
VCs don&apos;t have to act like VCs.  They get the pick of all the best  
deals.  So they don&apos;t have to be so paranoid and sneaky, and they 
can choose those rare companies, like Google, that will actually
benefit from the giant sums they&apos;re compelled to invest.<br><br>VCs often complain that in their business there&apos;s too much money
chasing too few deals.  Few realize that this also describes a flaw
in the way funding works at the level of individual firms.<br><br>Perhaps this was the sort of strategic insight I was supposed to   
come up with as a &quot;technologist in residence.&quot;  If so, the good
news is that they&apos;re getting it for free.  The bad news is it
means that if you&apos;re not one of the very top funds, you&apos;re 
condemned to be the bad guys.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] After Greylock booted founder Philip Greenspun out of ArsDigita,

due diligence tends to be like a body cavity search by someone with
a faulty knowledge of human anatomy.  After a while we were quite
sore from VCs attempting to probe our nonexistent database orifice.<br><br>No, we don&apos;t use Oracle.  We just store the data in files.  Our
secret is to use an OS that doesn&apos;t lose our data.  Which OS?
FreeBSD.  Why do you use that instead of Windows NT?  Because it&apos;s
better and it doesn&apos;t cost anything.  What, you&apos;re using a

March 2005<br><br><i>(Parts of this essay began as replies to students who wrote to
me with questions.)</i><br><br>Recently I&apos;ve had several emails from computer science
undergrads asking what to do in college. I might not
be the best source of advice, because I was a philosophy major in
college.  But I took so many CS classes that most CS majors thought
I was one.  I was certainly a hacker, at least.<br><br><b>Hacking</b><br><br>What should you do in college to become a 
<a href="gh.html">good hacker</a>?  There are two
main things you can do: become very good at programming, and learn
a lot about specific, cool problems.  These turn out to be equivalent,
because each drives you to do the other.<br><br>The way to be good at programming is to work (a) a lot (b) on hard
problems.  And the way to make yourself work on hard problems is
to work on some very engaging project.<br><br><!-- The first
derivative of "imagination is more important than knowledge" is
"curiosity is more important than discipline." [1] Nothing will
make you smarter faster than an engaging project.
-->
Odds are this project won&apos;t be a class assignment.  My friend Robert
learned a lot by writing network software when he was an
undergrad. One of his projects was to connect Harvard to the
Arpanet; it had been one of the original nodes, but by 1984 the
connection had died. [1]  Not only was this
work not for a class, but because he spent all his time on it
and neglected his studies, he was kicked out of
school for a year. [2]  It all evened out in the end, and now he&apos;s
a professor at MIT.  But you&apos;ll probably be happier if you don&apos;t
go to that extreme; it caused him a lot of worry at the time.<br><br>Another way to be good at programming is to find other people who
are good at it, and learn what they know.  Programmers tend to sort
themselves into tribes according to the type of work they do and
the tools they use, and some tribes are 
<a href="pypar.html">smarter</a> than others.  Look
around you and see what the smart people seem to be working on;
there&apos;s usually a reason.<br><br>Some of the smartest people around you are professors.  So one way
to find interesting work is to volunteer as a research assistant.
Professors are especially interested in people who can solve tedious
system-administration type problems for them, so that is a way to
get a foot in the door.  What they fear are
flakes and resume padders.  It&apos;s all too
common for an assistant to result in a net increase in work.  So
you have to make it clear you&apos;ll mean a net decrease.<br><br>Don&apos;t be put off if they say no.  Rejection is almost always less
personal than the rejectee imagines.  Just move on to the next.
(This applies to dating too.)<br><br>Beware, because although most professors are smart, not all of them
work on interesting stuff.  Professors have to publish novel results
to advance their careers, but there is more competition in more
interesting areas of research.  So what less ambitious professors
do is turn out a series of papers whose conclusions are novel because
no one else cares about them.  You&apos;re better off avoiding these.<br><br>I never worked as a research assistant, so I feel a bit dishonest
recommending that route.  I learned to program by writing stuff of
my own, particularly by trying to reverse-engineer Winograd&apos;s
SHRDLU.  I was as obsessed with that program as a mother with a new baby.<br><br>Whatever the disadvantages of working by yourself, the advantage
is that the project is all your own.  You never have to compromise
or ask anyone&apos;s permission, and if you have a new idea you can just
sit down and start implementing it.<br><br>In your own projects you don&apos;t have to worry about novelty (as
professors do) or profitability (as businesses do).  All that matters
is how hard the project is technically, and that has no correlation
to the nature of the application.  &quot;Serious&quot; applications like   
databases are often trivial and dull technically (if you ever suffer
from insomnia, try reading the technical literature about databases)
while &quot;frivolous&quot; applications like games are often very sophisticated.
I&apos;m sure there are game companies out there working on products
with more intellectual content than the research at the
bottom nine tenths of university CS departments.<br><br>If I were in college now I&apos;d probably work on
graphics: a network game, for example, or a tool for 3D animation.
When I was an undergrad there weren&apos;t enough cycles around to make
graphics interesting, but it&apos;s hard to imagine anything more fun
to work on now.<br><br><b>Math</b><br><br>When I was in college, a lot of the professors believed (or at least
wished) that 
<a href="hp.html">computer science</a> was a branch of math.  This idea was
strongest at Harvard, where there wasn&apos;t even a CS major till the
1980s; till then one had to major in applied math.  But it was
nearly as bad at Cornell.  When I told the fearsome Professor Conway
that I was interested in AI (a hot topic then), he told me I should
major in math.  I&apos;m still not sure whether he thought AI required
math, or whether he thought AI was nonsense and that majoring in
something rigorous would cure me of such stupid ambitions.<br><br>In fact, the amount of math you need as a hacker is a lot less   
than most university departments like to admit.  I don&apos;t think you  
need much more than high school math plus a few concepts from the
theory of computation.  (You have to know what an n^2 algorithm is
if you want to avoid writing them.) Unless you&apos;re planning to write
math applications, of course.  Robotics, for example, is all math.<br><br>But while you don&apos;t literally need math for most kinds of hacking,
in the sense of knowing 1001 tricks for differentiating formulas, 
math is very much worth studying for its own sake.  It&apos;s a 
valuable source of metaphors for almost any kind of work.[3] I wish 
I&apos;d studied more math in college for that reason.<br><br>Like a lot of people, I was mathematically abused as a child.  I   
learned to think of math as a collection of formulas that were
neither beautiful nor had any relation to my life (despite attempts
to translate them into &quot;word problems&quot;), but had to be memorized 
in order to do well on tests.<br><br>One of the most valuable things you could do in college would be
to learn what math is really about.  This may not be easy, because
a lot of good mathematicians are bad teachers.  And while there are
many popular books on math, few seem good.  The best I can think
of are W. W. Sawyer&apos;s.  And of course Euclid. [4]<br><br><b>Everything</b><br><br>Thomas Huxley said &quot;Try to learn something about everything and 
everything about something.&quot;  Most universities aim at this
ideal.<br><br>But what&apos;s everything?  To me it means, all that people
learn in the course of working honestly on hard problems.  All such 
work tends to be related, in that ideas and techniques from one   
field can often be transplanted successfully to others.  Even others
that seem quite distant.  For example, I write 
<a href="essay.html">essays</a> the same way
I write software: I sit down and blow out a lame version 1 as fast
as I can type, then spend several weeks rewriting it.<br><br>Working on hard problems is not, by itself, enough.  Medieval   
alchemists were working on a hard problem, but their approach was 
so bogus that there was little
to learn from studying it, except possibly about people&apos;s ability  
to delude themselves.  Unfortunately the sort of AI I was trying    
to learn in college had the same flaw: a very hard problem, blithely
approached with hopelessly inadequate techniques.  Bold?  Closer 
to fraudulent.
<!--
There is a good deal of such bogusness around.  For example, the
field of literary theory is almost entirely bogus.  They seem to 
be writing about hard questions, at least some of the time, but
standards in the field are so low that one need not say anything 
interesting, so long as one says it in a sufficiently complicated 
way. [6]<br><br>I'm not saying that literature is bogus, by the way, just that the
way to study it is the way its practitioners do.  Novelists work  
honestly on hard problems.  Indeed, it's precisely because this    
work is so hard that literary theory happens.   Most literary
theorists would be writers if they could, just as most art critics
would be artists. --><br><br>The social sciences are also fairly bogus, because they&apos;re so much 
influenced by intellectual <a href="say.html">fashions</a>.  If a 
physicist met a colleague
from 100 years ago, he could teach him some new things; if a psychologist
met a colleague from 100 years ago, they&apos;d just get into an
ideological argument.
Yes, of course, you&apos;ll learn something by taking a
psychology class.  The point is, you&apos;ll learn more by taking
a class in another department.<br><br>The worthwhile departments, in my opinion, are math, the hard
sciences, engineering, history (especially economic and social  
history, and the history of science), architecture, and the classics.
A survey course in art history may be worthwhile.  Modern literature
is important, but the way to learn about it is just to read.  I
don&apos;t know enough about music to say.<br><br>You can skip the social sciences, philosophy, and the various
departments created recently in response to political pressures.
Many of these fields talk about important problems, certainly.  But
the way they talk about them is useless.  For example, philosophy   
talks, among other things, about our obligations to one another;    
but you can learn more about this from a wise grandmother or E. B.
White than from an academic philosopher.<br><br>I speak here from experience.  I should probably have been offended 
when people laughed at Clinton for saying &quot;It depends on what the  
meaning of the word &apos;is&apos; is.&quot;  I took about five classes in college
on what the meaning of &quot;is&quot; is.<br><br>Another way to figure out which fields are worth studying is to  
create the <i> dropout graph.</i> For example, I know many people  
who switched from math to computer science because they found math  
too hard, and no one who did the opposite.  People don&apos;t do hard
things gratuitously; no one will work on a harder problem unless  
it is proportionately (or at least log(n)) more rewarding.  So
probably math is more worth studying than computer science.  By
similar comparisons you can make a graph of all the departments in
a university.  At the bottom you&apos;ll find the subjects with least 
intellectual content.<br><br>If you use this method, you&apos;ll get roughly the same answer I just 
gave.<br><br>Language courses are an anomaly.  I think they&apos;re better considered
as extracurricular activities, like pottery classes.  They&apos;d be far
more useful when combined with some time living in a country where 
the language is spoken.  On a whim I studied Arabic as a freshman.
It was a lot of work, and the only lasting benefits were a weird  
ability to identify semitic roots and some insights into how people
recognize words.<br><br>Studio art and creative writing courses are wildcards.  Usually 
you don&apos;t get taught much:  you just work (or don&apos;t work) on whatever
you want, and then sit around offering &quot;crits&quot; of one another&apos;s
creations under the vague supervision of the teacher.  But writing and
art are both very hard problems that (some) people work honestly
at, so they&apos;re worth doing, especially if you can find a good
teacher.<br><br><b>Jobs</b><br><br>Of course college students have to think about more than just
learning.  There are also two practical problems to consider: jobs,
and graduate school.<br><br>In theory a liberal education is not supposed to supply job training.
But everyone knows this is a bit of a fib.  Hackers at every college
learn practical skills, and not by accident.<br><br>What you should learn to get a job depends on the kind you want.
If you want to work in a big company, learn how to hack 
<a href="avg.html">Blub</a> on
Windows.  If you want to work at a cool little company or research  
lab, you&apos;ll do better to learn Ruby on Linux.  And if you want to  
start your own company, which I think will be more and more common,
master the most powerful tools you can find, because you&apos;re going
to be in a race against your competitors, and they&apos;ll be your horse.<br><br>There is not a direct correlation between the skills you should    
learn in college and those you&apos;ll use in a job.  You should aim     
slightly high in college.<br><br>In workouts a football player may bench press 300 pounds, even
though he may never have to exert anything like that much force in
the course of a game.  Likewise, if your professors try to make you
learn stuff that&apos;s more advanced than you&apos;ll need in a job, it may
not just be because they&apos;re academics, detached from the real world.
They may be trying to make you lift weights with your brain.<br><br>The programs you write in classes differ in three critical ways
from the ones you&apos;ll write in the real world: they&apos;re small; you
get to start from scratch; and the problem is usually artificial   
and predetermined.  In the real world, programs are bigger, tend   
to involve existing code, and often require you to figure out what 
the problem is before you can solve it.<br><br>You don&apos;t have to wait to leave (or even enter) college to learn   
these skills.  If you want to learn how to deal with existing code,
for example, you can contribute to open-source projects.  The sort
of employer you want to work for will be as impressed by that as 
good grades on class assignments.<br><br>In existing open-source projects you don&apos;t get much practice at
the third skill, deciding what problems to solve.  But there&apos;s 
nothing to stop you starting new projects of your own.  And  good
employers will be even more impressed
with that.<br><br>What sort of problem should you try to solve?  One way to answer
that is to ask what you need as a user.  For example, I stumbled
on a good algorithm for spam filtering because I wanted to stop  
getting spam.  Now what I wish I had was a mail reader that somehow
prevented my inbox from filling up.  I tend to use my inbox as a
todo list.  But that&apos;s like using a screwdriver to open
bottles; what one really wants is a bottle opener.<br><br><b>Grad School</b><br><br>What about grad school?  Should you go?  And how do you get into a  
good one?<br><br>In principle, grad school is professional training in research, and
you shouldn&apos;t go unless you want to do research as a career.  And   
yet half the people who get PhDs in CS don&apos;t go into research.
I didn&apos;t go to grad school to become a professor.  I went because   
I wanted to learn more.<br><br>So if you&apos;re mainly interested in hacking and you go to grad school,
you&apos;ll find a lot of other people who are similarly out of their  
element.  And if half the people around you are out of their element in the
same way you are, are you really out of your element?<br><br>There&apos;s a fundamental problem in &quot;computer science,&quot; and it surfaces
in situations like this.  No one is sure what &quot;research&quot; is supposed to be.  
A lot
of research is hacking that had to be crammed into the form of an
academic paper to yield one more quantum of publication.<br><br>So it&apos;s kind of misleading to ask whether you&apos;ll be at home in grad
school, because very few people are quite at home in computer
science.  The whole field is uncomfortable in its own skin.  So
the fact that you&apos;re mainly interested in hacking shouldn&apos;t deter  
you from going to grad school.  Just be warned you&apos;ll have to do a lot of stuff   
you don&apos;t like.<br><br>Number one will be your dissertation.  Almost everyone hates their
dissertation by the time they&apos;re done with it.  The
process inherently tends to produce an unpleasant result, like a cake made out
of whole wheat flour and baked for twelve hours.  Few dissertations 
are read with pleasure, especially by their authors.<br><br>But thousands before you have suffered through writing a dissertation.
And aside from that, grad school is close to paradise.  Many people
remember it as the happiest time of their lives.  And nearly all
the rest, including me, remember it as a period that would have 
been, if they hadn&apos;t had to write a dissertation. [5]<br><br>The danger with grad school is that you don&apos;t see the scary part
upfront.  PhD programs start out as college part 2, with several
years of classes.  So by the time you face the horror of writing a  
dissertation, you&apos;re already several years in.  If you quit now,
you&apos;ll be a grad-school dropout, and you probably won&apos;t like that
idea.  When Robert got kicked out of grad school for writing the
Internet worm of 1988, I envied him enormously for finding a way out
without the stigma of failure. <!-- And he was unhappy that Cornell
expelled him, the ingrate.--><br><br>On the whole, grad school is probably better than most alternatives.  You meet a 
lot of smart people, and your glum procrastination will at least    
be a powerful common bond.  And of course you have a PhD at the
end.  I forgot about that. I suppose that&apos;s worth something.<br><br>The greatest advantage of a PhD (besides being the union card of
academia, of course) may be that it gives you some baseline confidence.
For example, the Honeywell thermostats in my house have the most
atrocious UI.  My mother, who has the same model, diligently spent
a day reading the user&apos;s manual to learn how to operate hers.  She
assumed the problem was with her.  But I can think to myself &quot;If
someone with a PhD in computer science can&apos;t understand this
thermostat, it <i>must</i> be badly 
designed.&quot;<br><br>If you still want to go to grad school after this equivocal
recommendation, I can give you solid advice about how to get in. 
A lot of my friends are CS professors now, so I have the inside
story about admissions.  It&apos;s quite different from college.  At
most colleges, admissions officers decide who gets in.  For PhD
programs, the professors do.  And they try to do
it well, because the people they admit are going to be working for
them.<br><br>Apparently only recommendations really matter at the best schools.
Standardized tests count for nothing, and grades for little.  The
essay is mostly an opportunity to disqualify yourself by saying   
something stupid.  The only thing professors
trust is recommendations, preferably from people they know. [6]<br><br>So if you want to get into a PhD program, the key is to impress
your professors.  And from my friends who are professors I know 
what impresses them: not merely trying to impress them.  They&apos;re
not impressed by students who get good grades or want to be their
research assistants so they can get into grad school.  They&apos;re
impressed by students who get good grades and want to be their  
research assistants because they&apos;re genuinely interested in the 
topic.<br><br>So the best thing you can do in college, whether you want to get
into grad school or just be good at hacking, is figure out what you
truly like.  It&apos;s hard to trick professors into letting you into
grad school, and impossible to trick problems into letting you solve
them.  College is where faking stops working.  From this point,
unless you want to go work for a big company, which is like reverting
to high school, the only way forward is through doing what you 
<a href="love.html">love</a>.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br><!-- [1] When I was in college a lot of people had posters of Einstein
with "imagination is more important than knowledge" printed on them.
I think for many it was wishful thinking; it seemed to mean one
didn't have to study.  In fact what Einstein probably meant was:
knowledge is enormously important, but of two people who both have
great knowledge, the one with more imagination will do better.  That
doesn't make as good a quote, though.
-->
[1] No one seems to have minded, which shows how unimportant
the Arpanet (which became the Internet) was as late as
1984.<br><br>[2] This is why, when I became an employer, I didn&apos;t care
about GPAs.  In fact, we actively sought out people   
who&apos;d failed out of school.  We once put up posters around Harvard
saying &quot;Did you just get kicked out for doing badly in your classes
because you spent all your time working on some project of your   
own?  Come work for us!&quot;  We managed to find a kid who had been, 
and he was a great hacker.<br><br>When Harvard kicks undergrads out for a year, they have to get jobs.
The idea is to show them how awful the real world is, so they&apos;ll    
understand how lucky they are to be in college.  This plan backfired
with the guy who came to work for us, because he had more fun than
he&apos;d had in school, and made more that year from stock options than
any of his professors did in salary.  So instead of crawling back
repentant at the end of the year, he took another year off and went
to Europe.  He did eventually graduate at about 26.<br><br>[3] Eric Raymond says the best metaphors for hackers are
in set theory, combinatorics, and graph theory.<br><br>Trevor Blackwell reminds you to take math classes intended for math majors.
&quot;&apos;Math for engineers&apos; classes sucked mightily. In fact any &apos;x for
engineers&apos; sucks, where x includes math, law, writing and visual
design.&quot;<br><br>[4] Other highly recommended books: <i>What is Mathematics?</i>, by
Courant and Robbins;  <i>Geometry and the Imagination</i> by Hilbert and 
Cohn-Vossen.
And for those interested in graphic design,

in the Sokal Affair.
-->
[5] If you wanted to have the perfect life, the thing to do would
be to go to grad school, secretly write your dissertation in the
first year or two, and then just enjoy yourself for the next three
years, dribbling out a chapter at a time.  This prospect will make
grad students&apos; mouths water, but I know of no one who&apos;s had the
discipline to pull it off.<br><br>[6] One professor friend says that 15-20% of the grad students they
admit each year are &quot;long shots.&quot;  But what he means by long shots
are people whose applications are perfect in every way, except
that no one on the admissions committee knows the professors who
wrote the recommendations.<br><br>So if you want to get into
grad school in the sciences, you need to go to college somewhere with
real research professors.  Otherwise you&apos;ll seem a risky bet
to admissions committees, no matter how good you are.<br><br>Which implies
a surprising but apparently inevitable consequence:
little liberal arts colleges are doomed.
<!--, except those few that
make a conscious effort to
excel in the sciences.--> Most smart
high school kids at least consider going into the sciences, even
if they ultimately choose not to.
Why go to a college that limits their options?<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Alex Lewin, Jessica Livingston,

essays that were short and didn't mention Lisp.)</i>
-->
<i>(In the process
of answering an email, I accidentally wrote a tiny essay about writing.
I usually spend weeks on an essay.  This one took <!--44--> 67 minutes&#x2014;23
of writing, and <!--21--> 44 of rewriting.)</i><br><br>I think it&apos;s far more important to write well than most people
realize.  Writing doesn&apos;t just communicate ideas; it generates them.
If you&apos;re bad at writing and don&apos;t like to do it, you&apos;ll miss out
on most of the ideas writing would have generated.<br><br>As for how to write well, here&apos;s the short version: 
Write a bad version
1 as fast as you can; rewrite it over and over; cut <s>out</s> everything
unnecessary; write in a conversational tone; develop a nose for
bad writing, so you can see and fix it in yours; imitate writers
you like; if you can&apos;t get started, tell someone what you plan to
write about, then write down what you said; expect
80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it,
and 50% of those you start with to be wrong; be confident enough
to cut; have friends you trust read your stuff and tell you which
bits are confusing or drag; don&apos;t (always) make detailed outlines;
mull ideas over for a few days before
writing; carry a small notebook or scrap paper with you; start writing 
when you think of the first 
sentence; if a deadline
forces you to start before that, just say the most important sentence
first; write about stuff you like; don&apos;t try to sound impressive; don&apos;t hesitate to change the topic on the fly;
use footnotes to contain digressions; use anaphora to knit
sentences together; read your essays out loud to see (a) where you stumble
over awkward phrases and (b) which bits are boring (the
paragraphs you dread reading); try to tell the
reader something new and useful; work in fairly big quanta of time;
when you restart, begin by rereading what you have so far; when you
finish, leave yourself something easy to start with; accumulate
notes for topics you plan to cover at the bottom of the file; don&apos;t
feel obliged to cover any of them; write for a reader who won&apos;t
read the essay as carefully as you do, just as pop songs are
designed to sound ok on crappy car radios; <!-- read
writers you like, and try to figure out what makes you like them;-->
if you say anything mistaken, fix it immediately;
ask friends which sentence you&apos;ll regret most; go back and tone
down harsh remarks; publish stuff online, because
an audience makes you write more, and thus generate more
ideas; print out drafts instead of just looking at them
on the screen; use simple, germanic words; learn to distinguish
surprises from digressions; learn to recognize the approach of an
ending, and when one appears, grab it.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif"

I know are gradually switching to Macs.  My
friend Robert said his whole research group at MIT recently bought
themselves Powerbooks.  These guys are not the graphic designers
and grandmas who were buying Macs at Apple&apos;s low point in the
mid 1990s.  They&apos;re about as hardcore OS hackers as you can get.<br><br>The reason, of course, is OS X.  Powerbooks are beautifully designed
and run FreeBSD.  What more do you need to know?<br><br>I got a Powerbook at the end of last year.   When my IBM Thinkpad&apos;s
hard disk died soon after, it became my only laptop.  And when my
friend Trevor showed up at my house recently, he was carrying a
Powerbook <a href="tlbmac.html">identical</a> to mine.<br><br>For most of us, it&apos;s not a switch to Apple, but a return.  Hard as
this was to believe in the mid 90s, the Mac was in its time the
canonical hacker&apos;s computer.<br><br>In the fall of 1983,
the professor in one of my college CS classes got up and announced,
like a prophet, that there would soon be a computer with half a MIPS
of processing power that would fit under an airline seat and cost
so little that we could save enough to buy one from a summer job.
The whole room gasped.
And when the Mac appeared, it was even better than we&apos;d hoped.  It
was small and powerful and cheap, as promised.  But it was also
something we&apos;d never considered a computer could be: fabulously
well <a href="taste.html">designed</a>.<br><br>I had to have one.  And I wasn&apos;t alone.  In the mid to late 1980s,
all the hackers I knew were either writing software for the Mac,
or wanted to.  Every futon sofa in Cambridge seemed to have the
same fat white book lying open on it.  If you turned it over, it
said &quot;Inside Macintosh.&quot; <!-- in Apple Garamond. --><br><br>Then came Linux and FreeBSD, and hackers, who follow the most
powerful OS wherever it leads, found themselves switching to Intel
boxes.  If you cared about design, you could buy a Thinkpad, which
was at least not actively repellent, if you could get the Intel and
Microsoft <a href="designedforwindows.html">stickers</a> 
off the front. [1]<br><br>With OS X, the hackers are back.  When I walked into the Apple store
in Cambridge, it was like coming home.  Much
was changed, but there was still that Apple coolness in the air,
that feeling that the show was being run by someone who really
cared, instead of random corporate deal-makers.<br><br>So what, the business world may say. Who cares if hackers like Apple
again?  How big is the hacker market, after all?<br><br>Quite small, but important out of proportion to its size.  When it
comes to computers, what hackers are doing now, everyone will be
doing in ten years.  Almost all technology, from Unix to bitmapped
displays to the Web, became popular first within CS departments and
research labs, and gradually spread to the rest of the world.<br><br>I remember telling my father back in 1986 that there was a new kind
of computer called a Sun that was a serious Unix machine, but
so small and cheap that you could
have one of your own to sit in front of, instead of sitting in front
of a VT100 connected to a single central Vax.  Maybe, I suggested,
he should buy some stock in this company.  I think he really wishes
he&apos;d listened.<br><br>In 1994 my friend Koling wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan,
and to save long-distance bills he wrote some software that would  
convert sound to data packets that could be sent over the Internet.
We weren&apos;t sure at the time whether this was a proper use of the 
Internet, which was still then a quasi-government entity.  What he
was doing is now called VoIP, and it is a huge and rapidly growing
business.<br><br>If you want to know what ordinary people will be doing with computers
in ten years, just walk around the CS department at a good university.
Whatever they&apos;re doing, you&apos;ll be doing.<br><br>In the matter of &quot;platforms&quot; this tendency is even more pronounced,
because novel software originates with 
<a href="gh.html">great hackers</a>, and they tend
to write it first for whatever computer they personally use.  And
software sells hardware.  Many if not most of the initial sales of
the Apple II came from people who bought one to run VisiCalc.  And
why did Bricklin and Frankston write VisiCalc for the Apple II?
Because they personally liked it.  They could have chosen any machine
to make into a star.<br><br>If you want to attract hackers to write software that will sell
your hardware, you have to make it something that they themselves
use.  It&apos;s not enough to make it &quot;open.&quot;  It has to be open and
good.<br><br>And open and good is what Macs are again, finally.  The intervening
years have created a situation that is, as far as I know, without
precedent: Apple is popular at the low end and the high end, but
not in the middle.  My seventy year old mother has a Mac laptop.
My friends with PhDs in computer science have Mac laptops. [2] And yet 
Apple&apos;s overall market share is still small.<br><br>Though unprecedented, I predict this situation is also temporary.<br><br>So Dad, there&apos;s this company called Apple. They make a new kind of
computer that&apos;s as well designed as a Bang &amp; Olufsen stereo system,
and underneath is the best Unix machine you can buy.  Yes, the price
to earnings ratio is kind of high, but I think a lot of people are
going to want these.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] These horrible stickers are much like the intrusive ads popular
on pre-Google search engines.  They say to the customer: you are
unimportant.  We care about Intel and Microsoft, not you.<br><br>[2] <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>
is (we hope) visited mostly by
hackers.  The proportions of OSes are: 
Windows 66.4%, Macintosh 18.8%, Linux 11.4%, and FreeBSD 1.5%.
The Mac number is
a big change from what it would have been five years ago.<br><br><!--[These numbers are revised.  The original numbers overstated FreeBSD's
market share because they included hits from us.]

<p>
April 2005<br><br>This summer, as an 
experiment, some 
friends and I are giving <a href="http://ycombinator.com">seed
funding</a> to a bunch of new startups.  It&apos;s an experiment because
we&apos;re prepared to fund younger founders than most investors would.
That&apos;s why we&apos;re doing it during the summer&#x2014;so even college
students can participate.<br><br>We know from Google and Yahoo that grad students can start successful
startups.  And we know from experience that some undergrads are as
capable as most grad students.  The accepted age for startup founders
has been creeping downward. We&apos;re trying to find the lower bound.<br><br><!-- There have been cases, certainly, of startups founded by people
still in their teens.  But I suspect few of them were allowed
by investors to be more than mascots.<br><br>That's not how we plan to operate.  Having done it once, we have
no desire to experience again the 24/7 timesuck of running even one
startup, let alone eight or ten.  We'll give these guys as much
help as we can with their ideas, but it will be up to them to sink
or swim.
-->
The deadline has now passed, and we&apos;re sifting through 227 applications.
<!--We've learned a few surprising things in the process.
One pleasant surprise is how few cranks we got.  We expected to
attract flocks of them, but we've only had a handful.  We were
surprised, too, at how smart the applicants appear to be.  And how
extraordinarily energetic.  But you know what the most surprising
thing is?  How bad some of the smartest applicants' ideas are.-->
We expected to divide them into two categories, promising
and unpromising.  But we soon saw we needed a third: promising
people with unpromising ideas.
<font color="#777777">[<a name="f1" href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>The Artix Phase</b><br><br>We should have expected this.  It&apos;s very common for a group of
founders to go through one lame idea before realizing that a startup
has to make something people will pay for.   In fact, we ourselves
did.<br><br>Viaweb wasn&apos;t the first startup Robert Morris and I started.  In
January 1995, we and a couple friends started a company called
Artix.  The plan was to put art galleries on the Web.  In retrospect,
I wonder how we could have wasted our time on anything so stupid.
Galleries are not especially <a href="http://www.knoedlergallery.com/">excited</a> about being on
the Web even now, ten years later.  They don&apos;t want to have their
stock visible to any random visitor, like an antique store. 
<font color="#777777">[<a name="f2" href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Besides which, art dealers are the most technophobic people on
earth.  They didn&apos;t become art dealers after a difficult choice
between that and a career in the hard sciences.  Most of them had
never seen the Web before we came to tell them why they should be
on it.  Some didn&apos;t even have computers.  It doesn&apos;t do justice to
the situation to describe it as a hard <i>sell</i>; we soon sank
to building sites for free, and it was hard to convince galleries
even to do that.<br><br>Gradually it dawned on us that 
instead of trying to make Web sites for
people who didn&apos;t want them, we could make sites for
people who did.  In fact, software that would let people who wanted
sites make their own.  So we ditched Artix and
started a new company, Viaweb, to make software for building online stores.
That one succeeded.<br><br>We&apos;re in good company here.  Microsoft was not the first company
Paul Allen and Bill Gates started either.  The first was called
Traf-o-data.  <!-- I don't know exactly what happened to Traf-o-data,  
but i-->It does not seem to have done as well as Micro-soft.
<!-- , as Microsoft was called then.--><br><br>In Robert&apos;s defense, he was skeptical about Artix.  I dragged him
into it. 
<font color="#777777">[<a name="f3" href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
But there were moments when he was optimistic.  And
if we, who were 29 and 30 at the time, could get excited about such
a thoroughly boneheaded idea, we should not be surprised that hackers
aged 21 or 22 are pitching us ideas with little hope of making money.<br><br><b>The Still Life Effect</b><br><br>Why does this happen?  Why do good hackers have bad business ideas?<br><br>Let&apos;s look at our case.  One reason we had such a lame idea was
that it was the first thing we thought of.  I was in New York trying
to be a starving artist at the time (the starving part is actually
quite easy), so I was haunting galleries anyway.  When I learned
about the Web, it seemed natural to mix the two.  Make Web sites
for galleries&#x2014;that&apos;s the ticket!<br><br>If you&apos;re going to spend years working on something, you&apos;d think
it might be wise to spend at least a couple days considering different
ideas, instead of going with the first that comes into your head.
You&apos;d think.  But people don&apos;t.  In fact, this is a constant problem
when you&apos;re painting still lifes.  You plonk down a bunch of stuff
on a table, and maybe spend five or ten minutes rearranging it to 
look interesting.  But you&apos;re so impatient to get started painting
that ten minutes of rearranging feels very long.  So you start
painting.  Three days later, having spent twenty hours staring at
it, you&apos;re kicking yourself for having set up such an awkward and   
boring composition, but by then it&apos;s too late.<br><br>Part of the problem is that big projects tend to grow out of small
ones.  You set up a still life to make a quick sketch when you have
a spare hour, and days later you&apos;re still working on it.  I once
spent a month painting three versions of a still life I set up in
about four minutes.  At each point (a day, a week, a month) I thought
I&apos;d already put in so much time that it was too late to change.<br><br>So the biggest cause of bad ideas is the still life effect:  you 
come up with a random idea, plunge into it, and then at each point
(a day, a week, a month) feel you&apos;ve put so much time into it that
this must be <i>the</i> idea.<br><br>How do we fix that?  I don&apos;t think we should discard plunging.   
Plunging into an idea is a good thing.  The solution is at the other
end: to realize that having invested time in something doesn&apos;t make
it good.<br><br>This is clearest in the case of names.  Viaweb was originally
called Webgen, but we discovered someone else had a product called
that.  We were so attached to our name that we offered him <i>5%
of the company</i> if he&apos;d let us have it.   But he wouldn&apos;t, so
we had to think of another.  
<font color="#777777">[<a name="f4" href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
The best we could do was Viaweb,
which we disliked at first.  It was like having a new mother.  But 
within three days we loved it, and Webgen sounded lame and
old-fashioned.<br><br>If it&apos;s hard to change something so simple as a name, imagine
how hard it is to garbage-collect an idea.  A name only has one 
point of attachment into your head.  An idea for a company gets
woven into your thoughts.  So you must consciously discount for   
that.  Plunge in, by all means, but remember later to look at your   
idea in the harsh light of morning and ask: is this something people
will pay for?  Is this, of all the things we could make, the thing
people will pay most for?<br><br><b>Muck</b><br><br>The second mistake we made with Artix is also very common.  Putting
galleries on the Web seemed cool.<br><br>One of the most valuable things my father taught me is an old
Yorkshire saying: where there&apos;s muck, there&apos;s brass.  Meaning that 
unpleasant work pays.  And more to the point here, vice versa.  Work
people like doesn&apos;t pay well, for reasons of supply and demand.
The most extreme case is developing programming languages, which
doesn&apos;t pay at all, because people like it so much they do it for 
free.<br><br>When we started Artix, I was still ambivalent about business.  I
wanted to keep one foot in the art world.  Big, big, mistake.  Going
into business is like a hang-glider launch: you&apos;d better do it 
wholeheartedly, or not at all.  The purpose of a company, and a
startup especially, is to make money.  You can&apos;t have divided
loyalties.<br><br>Which is not to say that you have to do the most disgusting sort  
of work, like spamming, or starting a company whose only purpose  
is patent litigation.  What I mean is, if you&apos;re starting a company
that will do something cool, the aim had better be to make money 
and maybe be cool, not to be cool and maybe make money.<br><br>It&apos;s hard enough to make money that you can&apos;t do it by accident.
Unless it&apos;s your first priority, it&apos;s unlikely to happen at all.<br><br><b>Hyenas</b><br><br>When I probe our motives with Artix, I see a third mistake: timidity.
If you&apos;d proposed at the time that we go into the e-commerce business,
we&apos;d have found the idea terrifying.  Surely a field like that would
be dominated by fearsome startups with five million dollars of VC
money each.  Whereas we felt pretty sure that we could hold our own
in the slightly less competitive business of generating Web sites 
for art galleries.<br><br>We erred ridiculously far on the side of safety.  As it turns out,
VC-backed startups are not that fearsome.  They&apos;re too busy trying
to spend all that 
<a href="venturecapital.html">money</a> to get software written.  In 1995, the
e-commerce business was very competitive as measured in press
releases, but not as measured in software.  And really it never
was.  The big fish like Open Market (rest their souls) were just
consulting companies pretending to be product companies 
<font color="#777777">[<a name="f5" href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font>, and  
the offerings at our end of the market were a couple hundred lines
of Perl scripts.  Or could have been implemented as a couple hundred
lines of Perl; in fact they were probably tens of thousands of lines
of C++ or Java.  Once we actually took the plunge into e-commerce,
it turned out to be surprisingly easy to compete.<br><br>So why were we afraid?  We felt we were good at programming, but
we lacked confidence in our ability to do a mysterious, undifferentiated
thing we called &quot;business.&quot;  In fact there is no such thing as
&quot;business.&quot; There&apos;s selling, promotion, figuring out what people
want, deciding how much to charge, customer support, paying your
bills, getting customers to pay you, getting incorporated, raising
money, and so on.  And the combination is not as hard as it seems,   
because some tasks (like raising money and getting incorporated)
are an O(1) pain in the ass, whether you&apos;re big or small, and others
(like selling and promotion) depend more on energy and imagination
than any kind of special training.<br><br>Artix was like a hyena, content to survive on carrion because we
were afraid of the lions.  Except the lions turned out not to have 
any teeth, and the business of putting galleries online barely
qualified as carrion.<br><br><b>A Familiar Problem</b><br><br>Sum up all these sources of error, and it&apos;s no wonder we had such
a bad idea for a company.  We did the first thing we thought of;
we were ambivalent about being in business at all; and we deliberately
chose an impoverished market to avoid competition.<br><br>Looking at the applications for the Summer Founders Program, I see
signs of all three.  But the first is by far the biggest problem.  
Most of the groups applying have not stopped to ask: of all the 
things we could do, is <i>this</i> the one with the best chance of
making money?<br><br>If they&apos;d already been through their Artix phase, they&apos;d have learned
to ask that.  After the reception we got from art dealers, we were
ready to.  This time, we thought, let&apos;s make something people want.<br><br>Reading the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> for a week should give anyone
ideas for two or three new startups.  The articles are full of
descriptions of problems that need to be solved.  But most of the
applicants don&apos;t seem to have looked far for ideas.<br><br>We expected the most common proposal to be for multiplayer games.
We were not far off: this was the second most common. 
The most common was some combination of a blog, a calendar,
a dating site, and Friendster.  Maybe there is some new killer app
to be discovered here, but it seems perverse to go poking around
in this fog when there are valuable, unsolved problems lying about
in the open for anyone to see.  Why did no one propose a new scheme   
for micropayments?  An ambitious project, perhaps, but I can&apos;t    
believe we&apos;ve considered every alternative.  And newspapers and
magazines are (literally) dying for a solution.<br><br>Why did so few applicants really think about what customers want?
I think the problem with many, as with people in their early twenties
generally, is that they&apos;ve been trained their whole lives to jump
through predefined hoops.  They&apos;ve spent 15-20 years solving problems
other people have set for them.  And how much time deciding what  
problems would be good to solve?  Two or three course projects?   
<!-- Robert is one of us trying to rank the applications.  He's a professor
now, and he said recently that reading the proposals felt awfully 
familiar.  -->
They&apos;re good at solving problems, but bad at choosing them.<br><br>But that, I&apos;m convinced, is just the effect of training.  Or more
precisely, the effect of grading.  To make grading efficient,
everyone has to solve the same problem, and that means it has to
be decided in advance.  It would be great if schools taught students
how to choose problems as well as how to solve them, but I don&apos;t
know how you&apos;d run such a class in practice.<br><br><b>Copper and Tin</b><br><br>The good news is, choosing problems is something that can be learned.
I know that from experience.  Hackers can learn to make things
customers want. 
<font color="#777777">[<a name="f6" href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>This is a controversial view.  One expert on &quot;entrepreneurship&quot;
told me that any startup had to include business people, because
only they could focus on what customers wanted.  I&apos;ll probably
alienate this guy forever by quoting him, but I have to risk it,
because his email was such a perfect example of this view:
<blockquote> 
  80% of MIT spinoffs succeed <i>provided</i> they 
  have at least one management person in the team at the start. The   
  business person represents the &quot;voice of the customer&quot; and that&apos;s
  what keeps the engineers and product development on track.
</blockquote>
This is, in my opinion, a crock.  Hackers are perfectly capable of
hearing the voice of the customer without a business person to
amplify the signal for them.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin were grad
students in computer science, which presumably makes them &quot;engineers.&quot;
Do you suppose Google is only good because they had some business
guy whispering in their ears what customers wanted?   It seems to 
me the business guys who did the most for Google were the ones who 
obligingly flew Altavista into a hillside just as Google was getting
started.<br><br>The hard part about figuring out what customers want is figuring 
out that you need to figure it out.  But that&apos;s something you can
learn quickly.  It&apos;s like seeing the other interpretation of an
ambiguous picture.  As soon as someone tells you there&apos;s a rabbit
as well as a duck, it&apos;s hard not to see it.<br><br>And compared to the sort of problems hackers are used to solving,
giving customers what they want is easy.  Anyone who can write an 
optimizing compiler can design a UI that doesn&apos;t confuse users, 
once they <i>choose</i> to focus on that problem.  And once you   
apply that kind of brain power to petty but profitable questions,     
you can create wealth very rapidly.<br><br>That&apos;s the essence of a startup: having brilliant people do work
that&apos;s beneath them.   Big companies try to hire the right person
for the job.  Startups win because they don&apos;t&#x2014;because they take
people so smart that they would in a big company be doing &quot;research,&quot;
and set them to work instead on problems of the most immediate and
mundane sort.  Think Einstein designing refrigerators.

When a friend recommended this book, I couldn&apos;t believe he was
serious.  But he insisted it was good, so I read it, and he was   
right.  It deals with the most difficult problem in human experience:
how to see things from other people&apos;s point of view, instead of
thinking only of yourself.<br><br>Most smart people don&apos;t do that very well.  But adding this ability
to raw brainpower is like adding tin to copper.  The result is
bronze, which is so much harder that it seems a different metal.<br><br>A hacker who has learned what to make, and not just how to make,
is extraordinarily powerful.  And not just at making money: look
what a small group of volunteers has achieved with Firefox.<br><br>Doing an Artix teaches you to make something people want in the
same way that not drinking anything would teach you how much you
depend on water.  But it would be more convenient for all involved
if the Summer Founders didn&apos;t learn this on our dime&#x2014;if they could
skip the Artix phase and go right on to make something customers
wanted.  That, I think, is going to be the real experiment this 
summer.  How long will it take them to grasp this?<br><br><!--With us beating it into their heads constantly, that is.-->  We decided

On the other hand, he was skeptical about Viaweb too.  I have

Trevor Blackwell presents the following recipe for a startup:  
&quot;Watch people who have money to spend, see what they&apos;re wasting

<!-- Are these all describing the same comeback-- in which case
the <i>Times</i> style section is two years behind <i>Business Week</i> in

PR firms <a href="http://www.maximumexposurepr.com/middleMAA.html">tell</a> 
them to.  One of the most surprising things I discovered
during my brief business career was the existence of the PR industry,
lurking like a huge, quiet submarine beneath the news.  Of the
stories you read in traditional media that aren&apos;t about politics,
crimes, or disasters, more than half probably come from PR firms.<br><br>I know because I spent years hunting such &quot;press hits.&quot;  Our startup spent
its entire marketing budget on PR: at a time when we were assembling
our own computers to save money, we were paying a PR firm $16,000
a month.  And they were worth it.  PR is the news equivalent of
search engine optimization; instead of buying ads, which readers
ignore, you get yourself inserted directly into the stories.  <font color="#777777">[<a name="f1" href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br><a href="http://schwartz-pr.com/client_coverage.php">Our PR firm</a>
was one of the best in the business.  In 18 months, they got press
hits in over 60 different publications.  <!-- They made us into stars. -->
And we weren&apos;t the only ones they did great things for.  
In 1997 I got a call from another
startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company.  I
told him they were PR gods, worth every penny of their outrageous   
fees.  But I remember thinking his company&apos;s name was odd.
Why call an auction site &quot;eBay&quot;?<br><br>
<b>Symbiosis</b><br><br>PR is not dishonest.  Not quite.  In fact, the reason the best PR
firms are so effective is precisely that they aren&apos;t dishonest.
They give reporters genuinely valuable information.  A good PR firm
won&apos;t bug reporters just because the client tells them to; they&apos;ve
worked hard to build their credibility with reporters, and they
don&apos;t want to destroy it by feeding them mere propaganda.<br><br>If anyone is dishonest, it&apos;s the reporters.  The main reason PR  
firms exist is that reporters are lazy.  Or, to put it more nicely,
overworked.  Really they ought to be out there digging up stories
for themselves.  But it&apos;s so tempting to sit in their offices and
let PR firms bring the stories to them.  After all, they know good
PR firms won&apos;t lie to them.<br><br>A good flatterer doesn&apos;t lie, but tells his victim selective truths
(what a nice color your eyes are). Good PR firms use the same
strategy: they give reporters stories that are true, but whose truth
favors their clients.<br><br>For example, our PR firm often pitched stories about how the Web  
let small merchants compete with big ones.  This was perfectly true.
But the reason reporters ended up writing stories about this
particular truth, rather than some other one, was that small merchants
were our target market, and we were paying the piper.<br><br>Different publications vary greatly in their reliance on PR firms.
At the bottom of the heap are the trade press, who make most of
their money from advertising and would give the magazines away for
free if advertisers would let them.  <font color="#777777">[<a name="f2" href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font> The average
trade publication is a  bunch of ads, glued together by just enough
articles to make it look like a magazine.  They&apos;re so desperate for
&quot;content&quot; that some will print your press releases almost verbatim,
if you take the trouble to write them to read like articles.<br><br>At the other extreme are publications like the <i>New York Times</i>
and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>.  Their reporters do go out and
find their own stories, at least some of the time.  They&apos;ll listen 
to PR firms, but briefly and skeptically.  We managed to get press   
hits in almost every publication we wanted, but we never managed 
to crack the print edition of the <i>Times</i>.  <font color="#777777">[<a name="f3" href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The weak point of the top reporters is not laziness, but vanity.
You don&apos;t pitch stories to them.  You have to approach them as if
you were a specimen under their all-seeing microscope, and make it
seem as if the story you want them to run is something they thought 
of themselves.<br><br>Our greatest PR coup was a two-part one.  We estimated, based on
some fairly informal math, that there were about 5000 stores on the
Web.  We got one paper to print this number, which seemed neutral   
enough.  But once this &quot;fact&quot; was out there in print, we could quote
it to other publications, and claim that with 1000 users we had 20%
of the online store market.<br><br>This was roughly true.  We really did have the biggest share of the
online store market, and 5000 was our best guess at its size.  But
the way the story appeared in the press sounded a lot more definite.<br><br>Reporters like definitive statements.  For example, many of the
stories about Jeremy Jaynes&apos;s conviction say that he was one of the
10 worst spammers.  This &quot;fact&quot; originated in Spamhaus&apos;s ROKSO list,
which I think even Spamhaus would admit is a rough guess at the top
spammers.  The first stories about Jaynes cited this source, but
now it&apos;s simply repeated as if it were part of the indictment.   
<font color="#777777">[<a name="f4" href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>All you can say with certainty about Jaynes is that he was a fairly
big spammer.  But reporters don&apos;t want to print vague stuff like
&quot;fairly big.&quot;  They want statements with punch, like &quot;top ten.&quot; And
PR firms give them what they want.
Wearing suits, we&apos;re told, will make us 
<a href="http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2002/02/25/story5.html?t=printable">3.6
percent</a> more productive.<br><br><b>Buzz</b><br><br>Where the work of PR firms really does get deliberately misleading is in
the generation of &quot;buzz.&quot;  They usually feed the same story to    
several different publications at once.  And when readers see similar
stories in multiple places, they think there is some important trend
afoot.  Which is exactly what they&apos;re supposed to think.<br><br>When Windows 95 was launched, people waited outside stores
at midnight to buy the first copies.  None of them would have been
there without PR firms, who generated such a buzz in
the news media that it became self-reinforcing, like a nuclear chain
reaction.<br><br>I doubt PR firms realize it yet, but the Web makes it possible to  
track them at work.  If you search for the obvious phrases, you
turn up several efforts over the years to place stories about the  
return of the suit.  For example, the Reuters article 
<!-- by Elizabeth Lazarowitz -->
that got picked up by <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2004-09-01-suits_x.htm">USA
Today</a> in September 2004.  &quot;The suit is back,&quot; it begins.<br><br>Trend articles like this are almost always the work of
PR firms.  Once you know how to read them, it&apos;s straightforward to
figure out who the client is.  With trend stories, PR firms usually
line up one or more &quot;experts&quot; to talk about the industry generally. 
In this case we get three: the NPD Group, the creative director of
GQ, and a research director at Smith Barney.  <font color="#777777">[<a name="f5" href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font> When
you get to the end of the experts, look for the client. And bingo, 
there it is: The Men&apos;s Wearhouse.<br><br>Not surprising, considering The Men&apos;s Wearhouse was at that moment 
running ads saying &quot;The Suit is Back.&quot;  Talk about a successful
press hit-- a wire service article whose first sentence is your own
ad copy.<br><br>The secret to finding other press hits from a given pitch
is to realize that they all started from the same document back at
the PR firm.  Search for a few key phrases and the names of the
clients and the experts, and you&apos;ll turn up other variants of this 
story.<br><br><a href="http://bostonworks.boston.com/globe/articles/091904_suit.html">Casual

Mercer of <i>The Detroit News</i>.<br><br>
Now that so many news articles are online, I suspect you could find
a similar pattern for most trend stories placed by PR firms.  I
propose we call this new sport &quot;PR diving,&quot; and I&apos;m sure there are
far more striking examples out there than this clump of five stories.<br><br><b>Online</b><br><br>After spending years chasing them, it&apos;s now second nature
to me to recognize press hits for what they are.  But before we
hired a PR firm I had no idea where articles in the mainstream media
came from.  I could tell a lot of them were crap, but I didn&apos;t
realize why.<br><br>Remember the exercises in critical reading you did in school, where
you had to look at a piece of writing and step back and ask whether
the author was telling the whole truth?  If you really want to be
a critical reader, it turns out you have to step back one step
further, and ask not just whether the author is telling the truth,
but <i>why he&apos;s writing about this subject at all.</i><br><br>Online, the answer tends to be a lot simpler.  Most people who
publish online write what they write for the simple reason that
they want to.  You
can&apos;t see the fingerprints of PR firms all over the articles, as
you can in so many print publications-- which is one of the reasons,
though they may not consciously realize it, that readers trust
bloggers more than <i>Business Week</i>.<br><br>I was talking recently to a friend who works for a
big newspaper.  He thought the print media were in serious trouble,
and that they were still mostly in denial about it.  &quot;They think
the decline is cyclic,&quot; he said.  &quot;Actually it&apos;s structural.&quot;<br><br>In other words, the readers are leaving, and they&apos;re not coming
back.<br><br>
Why? I think the main reason is that the writing online is more honest.
Imagine how incongruous the <i>New York Times</i> article about
suits would sound if you read it in a blog:
  <blockquote> The urge to look corporate-- sleek, commanding,
  prudent, yet with just a touch of hubris on your well-cut sleeve--
  is an unexpected development in a time of business disgrace.
  </blockquote> 
The problem
with this article is not just that it originated in a PR firm.
The whole tone is bogus.  This is the tone of someone writing down
to their audience.<br><br>Whatever its flaws, the writing you find online
is authentic.  It&apos;s not mystery meat cooked up
out of scraps of pitch letters and press releases, and pressed into 
molds of zippy
journalese.  It&apos;s people writing what they think.<br><br>I didn&apos;t realize, till there was an alternative, just how artificial
most of the writing in the mainstream media was.  I&apos;m not saying
I used to believe what I read in <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i>.  Since high
school, at least, I&apos;ve thought of magazines like that more as
guides to what ordinary people were being
<a href="say.html">told</a> to think than as  
sources of information.  But I didn&apos;t realize till the last  
few years that writing for publication didn&apos;t have to mean writing
that way.  I didn&apos;t realize you could write as candidly and
informally as you would if you were writing to a friend.<br><br>Readers aren&apos;t the only ones who&apos;ve noticed the
change.  The PR industry has too.
A hilarious <a href="http://www.prsa.org/_Publications/magazines/0802news1.asp">article</a>
on the site of the PR Society of America gets to the heart of the   
matter:
  <blockquote> Bloggers are sensitive about becoming mouthpieces
  for other organizations and companies, which is the reason they
  began blogging in the first place.  </blockquote>
PR people fear bloggers for the same reason readers
like them.  And that means there may be a struggle ahead.  As
this new kind of writing draws readers away from traditional media, we
should be prepared for whatever PR mutates into to compensate.  
When I think   
how hard PR firms work to score press hits in the traditional   
media, I can&apos;t imagine they&apos;ll work any less hard to feed stories
to bloggers, if they can figure out how.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] PR has at least   
one beneficial feature: it favors small companies.  If PR didn&apos;t  
work, the only alternative would be to advertise, and only big
companies can afford that.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>] Advertisers pay 
less for ads in free publications, because they assume readers 
ignore something they get for free.  This is why so many trade
publications nominally have a cover price and yet give away free
subscriptions with such abandon.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>] Different sections
of the <i>Times</i> vary so much in their standards that they&apos;re
practically different papers.  Whoever fed the style section reporter
this story about suits coming back would have been sent packing by
the regular news reporters.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>] The most striking
example I know of this type is the &quot;fact&quot; that the Internet worm   
of 1988 infected 6000 computers. I was there when it was cooked up,
and this was the recipe: someone guessed that there were about
60,000 computers attached to the Internet, and that the worm might
have infected ten percent of them.<br><br>Actually no one knows how many computers the worm infected, because
the remedy was to reboot them, and this destroyed all traces.  But
people like numbers.  And so this one is now <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=internet+worm+1988+6000">replicated</a>
all over the Internet, like a little worm of its own.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>] Not all were
necessarily supplied by the PR firm. Reporters sometimes call a few
additional sources on their own, like someone adding a few fresh 
vegetables to a can of soup.<br><br><!-- [<a name="f6n"><font color=#000000>6</font></a>] More precisely,
they're driven by a kind of devotion that includes a large admixture
of vanity.  But writers have always been like this, no matter what the
medium.

May 2005<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at the Berkeley CSUA.)</i><br><br>The three big powers on the Internet now are Yahoo, Google, and
Microsoft.  Average age of their founders: 24.  So it is pretty
well established now that grad students can start successful
companies.  And if grad students can do it, why not undergrads?<br><br>Like everything else in technology, the cost of starting a startup
has decreased dramatically.  Now it&apos;s so low that it has disappeared
into the noise. The main cost of starting a Web-based
startup is food and rent.  Which means it doesn&apos;t cost much more
to start a company than to be a total slacker.  You can probably
start a startup on ten thousand dollars of seed funding, if you&apos;re
prepared to live on ramen.<br><br>The less it costs to start a company, the less you need the permission
of investors to do it.  So a lot of people will be able to start
companies now who never could have before.<br><br>The most interesting subset may be those in their early twenties.
I&apos;m not so excited about founders who have everything investors
want except intelligence, or everything except energy.  The most
promising group to be liberated by the new, lower threshold are
those who have everything investors want except experience.<br><br><b>Market Rate</b><br><br>I once claimed that <a href="nerds.html">nerds</a> were unpopular
in secondary school mainly because they had better things to do
than work full-time at being popular.  Some said I was just telling
people what they wanted to hear.  Well, I&apos;m now about to do that
in a spectacular way: I think undergraduates are undervalued.<br><br>Or more precisely, I think few realize the huge
spread in the value of 20 year olds.  Some, it&apos;s true, are not very
capable.  But others are more capable than all but a handful of 30
year olds. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Till now the problem has always been that it&apos;s difficult to pick
them out.  Every VC in the world, if they could go back in time,
would try to invest in Microsoft.  But which would have then?  How
many would have understood that this particular 19 year old was
Bill Gates?<br><br>It&apos;s hard to judge the young because (a) they change rapidly, (b)
there is great variation between them, and (c) they&apos;re individually
inconsistent.  That last one is a big problem.  When you&apos;re young,
you occasionally say and do stupid things even when you&apos;re smart.
So if the algorithm is to filter out people who say stupid things,
as many investors and employers unconsciously do, you&apos;re going to
get a lot of false positives.<br><br>Most organizations who hire people right out of college are only
aware of the average value of 22 year olds, which is not that high.  
And so the idea for most of the twentieth century was that everyone
had to begin as a trainee in some 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=158756&amp;cid=13299057">entry-level</a> job.  Organizations  
realized there was a lot of variation in the incoming stream, but
instead of pursuing this thought they tended to suppress it, in the
belief that it was good for even the most promising kids to start 
at the bottom, so they didn&apos;t get swelled heads.<br><br>The most productive young people will <i>always</i> be undervalued
by large organizations, because the young have no performance to
measure yet, and any error in guessing their ability will tend 
toward the mean.<br><br>What&apos;s an especially productive 22 year old to do?  One thing you   
can do is go over the heads of organizations, directly to the users.
Any company that hires you is, economically, acting as a proxy for
the customer.  The rate at which they value you (though they may
not consciously realize it) is an attempt to guess your value to  
the user.  But there&apos;s a way to appeal their judgement.  If you
want, you can opt to be valued directly by users, by starting your
own company.<br><br>The market is a lot more discerning than any employer.  And it is
completely non-discriminatory.  On the Internet, nobody knows you&apos;re
a dog.  And more to the point, nobody knows you&apos;re 22.  All users
care about is whether your site or software gives them what they
want.  They don&apos;t care if the person behind it is a high school 
kid.<br><br>If you&apos;re really productive, why not make employers pay market rate
for you?  Why go work as an ordinary employee for a big
company, when you could start a startup and make them buy it to get
you?<br><br>When most people hear the word &quot;startup,&quot; they think of the famous 
ones that have gone public.  But most startups that succeed do it
by getting bought.  And usually the acquirer doesn&apos;t just want the
technology, but the people who created it as well.<br><br>Often big companies buy startups before they&apos;re profitable.  Obviously
in such cases they&apos;re not after revenues.  What they want is the  
development team and the software they&apos;ve built so far.  When a
startup gets bought for 2 or 3 million six months in, it&apos;s really
more of a hiring bonus than an acquisition.<br><br>I think this sort of thing will happen more and more, and that it 
will be better for everyone.  It&apos;s obviously better for the people
who start the startup, because they get a big chunk of money up
front.  But I think it will be better for the acquirers too.  The
central problem in big companies, and the main reason they&apos;re so 
much less productive than small companies, is the difficulty of
valuing each person&apos;s work.  Buying larval startups solves that   
problem for them: the acquirer doesn&apos;t pay till the developers have
proven themselves.  Acquirers are protected on the downside, but   
still get most of the upside.<br><br><b>Product Development</b><br><br>Buying startups also solves another problem afflicting big companies:
they can&apos;t do product development.  Big companies are good at
extracting the value from existing products, but bad at creating   
new ones.<br><br>Why? It&apos;s worth studying this phenomenon in detail, because this  
is the raison d&apos;etre of startups.<br><br>To start with, most big companies have some kind of turf to protect,
and this tends to warp their development decisions.  For example,
<a href="road.html">Web-based</a> applications are hot now, but
within Microsoft there must
be a lot of ambivalence about them, because the very idea of Web-based
software threatens the desktop.  So any Web-based application that  
Microsoft ends up with, will probably, like Hotmail, be something   
developed outside the company.<br><br>Another reason big companies are bad at developing new products is
that the kind of people who do that tend not to have much power in
big companies (unless they happen to be the CEO).  Disruptive
technologies are developed by disruptive people.  And they either
don&apos;t work for the big company, or have been outmaneuvered by yes-men
and have comparatively little influence.<br><br>Big companies also lose because they usually only build one of each
thing.  When you only have one Web browser, you can&apos;t do anything
really risky with it.  If ten different startups design ten different
Web browsers and you take the best, you&apos;ll probably get something
better.<br><br>The more general version of this problem is that there are too many
new ideas for companies to explore them all.  There might be 500   
startups right now who think they&apos;re making something Microsoft
might buy.  Even Microsoft probably couldn&apos;t manage 500 development
projects in-house.<br><br>Big companies also don&apos;t pay people the right way.  People developing
a new product at a big company get paid roughly the same whether
it succeeds or fails.  People at a startup expect to get rich if
the product succeeds, and get nothing if it fails. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>  So naturally
the people at the startup work a lot harder.<br><br>The mere bigness of big companies is an obstacle.  In startups,  
developers are often forced to talk directly to users, whether they
want to or not, because there is no one else to do sales and support.
It&apos;s painful doing sales, but you learn much more from
trying to sell people something than reading what   
they said in focus groups.<br><br>And then of course, big companies are bad at product development 
because they&apos;re bad at everything.  Everything happens slower in
big companies than small ones, and product development is something
that has to happen fast, because you have to go through a lot of   
iterations to get something good.<br><br><b>Trend</b><br><br>I think the trend of big companies buying startups will only
accelerate.  One of the biggest remaining obstacles is pride.  Most  
companies, at least unconsciously, feel they ought to be able to
develop stuff in house, and that buying startups is to some degree 
an admission of failure.  And so, as people generally do with
admissions of failure, they put it off for as long as possible.
That makes the acquisition very expensive when it finally happens.<br><br>What companies should do is go out and discover startups when they&apos;re
young, before VCs have puffed them up into something that costs
hundreds of millions to acquire.  Much of what VCs add, the acquirer
doesn&apos;t need anyway.<br><br>Why don&apos;t acquirers try to predict the companies they&apos;re going to
have to buy for hundreds of millions, and grab them early for a     
tenth or a twentieth of that?  Because they can&apos;t predict the winners
in advance?  If they&apos;re only paying a twentieth as much, they only
have to predict a twentieth as well.  Surely they can manage that.<br><br>I think companies that acquire technology will gradually learn to 
go after earlier stage startups.  They won&apos;t necessarily buy them
outright.  The solution may be some hybrid of investment and
acquisition: for example, to buy a chunk of the company and get an
option to buy the rest later.<br><br>When companies buy startups, they&apos;re effectively fusing recruiting 
and product development.  And I think that&apos;s more efficient than 
doing the two separately, because you always get people who are
really committed to what they&apos;re working on.<br><br>Plus this method yields teams of developers who already work well
together.  Any conflicts between them have been ironed out under   
the very hot iron of running a startup.  By the time the acquirer  
gets them, they&apos;re finishing one another&apos;s sentences.  That&apos;s  
valuable in software, because so many bugs occur at the boundaries 
between different people&apos;s code.<br><br><b>Investors</b><br><br>The increasing cheapness of starting a company doesn&apos;t just give
hackers more power relative to employers.  It also gives them more 
power relative to investors.<br><br>The conventional wisdom among VCs is that hackers shouldn&apos;t be   
allowed to run their own companies.  The founders are supposed to  
accept MBAs as their bosses, and themselves take on some title like  
Chief Technical Officer.  There may be cases where this is a good 
idea.  But I think founders will increasingly be able to push back
in the matter of control, because they just don&apos;t need the investors&apos;
money as much as they used to.<br><br>Startups are a comparatively new phenomenon.  Fairchild Semiconductor
is considered the first VC-backed startup, and they were founded   
in 1959, less than fifty years ago.  Measured on the time scale of   
social change, what we have now is pre-beta.  So we shouldn&apos;t assume
the way startups work now is the way they have to work.<br><br>Fairchild needed a lot of money to get started.  They had to build
actual factories.  What does the first round of venture funding for
a Web-based startup get spent on today?  More money can&apos;t get
software written faster; it isn&apos;t needed for facilities, because
those can now be quite cheap; all money can really buy you is sales
and marketing.  A sales force is worth something, I&apos;ll admit.  But
marketing is increasingly irrelevant.  On the Internet, anything
genuinely good will spread by word of mouth.<br><br>Investors&apos; power comes from money.  When startups need less money,   
investors have less power over them.  So future founders may not
have to accept new CEOs if they don&apos;t want them.  The VCs will have 
to be dragged kicking and screaming down this road, but like many
things people have to be dragged kicking and screaming toward, it
may actually be good for them.<br><br>Google is a sign of the way things are going.  As a condition of
funding, their investors insisted they hire someone old and experienced
as CEO.  But from what I&apos;ve heard the founders didn&apos;t just give in
and take whoever the VCs wanted.  They delayed for an entire year,
and when they did finally take a CEO, they chose a guy with a PhD 
in computer science.<br><br>It sounds to me as if the founders are still the most powerful
people in the company, and judging by Google&apos;s performance, their
youth and inexperience doesn&apos;t seem to have hurt them.  Indeed, I
suspect Google has done better than they would have if the founders
had given the VCs what they wanted, when they wanted it, and let 
some MBA take over as soon as they got their first round of funding.<br><br>I&apos;m not claiming the business guys installed by VCs have no value.
Certainly they have.  But they don&apos;t need to become the founders&apos;
bosses, which is what that title CEO means.  I predict that in the 
future the executives installed by VCs will increasingly be COOs
rather than CEOs.  The founders will run engineering directly, and
the rest of the company through the COO.<br><br><b>The Open Cage</b><br><br>With both employers and investors, the balance of power is slowly
shifting towards the young.  And yet they seem the last to realize
it.  Only the most ambitious undergrads even consider starting their
own company when they graduate.  Most just want to get a job.<br><br>Maybe this is as it should be.  Maybe if the idea of starting a  
startup is intimidating, you filter out the uncommitted.  But I    
suspect the filter is set a little too high.  I think there are
people who could, if they tried, start successful startups, and who
instead let themselves be swept into the intake ducts of big
companies.<br><br>Have you ever noticed that when animals are let out of cages, they
don&apos;t always realize at first that the door&apos;s open?  Often they
have to be poked with a stick to get them out.  Something similar  
happened with blogs.  People could have been publishing online in    
1995, and yet blogging has only really taken off in the last couple
years.  In 1995 we thought only professional writers were entitled
to publish their ideas, and that anyone else who did was a crank.
Now publishing online is becoming so popular that everyone wants  
to do it, even print journalists.  But blogging has not taken off  
recently because of any technical innovation; it just took eight
years for everyone to realize the cage was open.<br><br>I think most undergrads don&apos;t realize yet that the economic cage  
is open.  A lot have been told by their parents that the route to
success is to get a good job.  This was true when their parents
were in college, but it&apos;s less true now. The route to success is
to build something valuable, and you don&apos;t have to be working for    
an existing company to do that.  Indeed, you can often do it better
if you&apos;re not.<br><br>When I talk to undergrads, what surprises me most about them is how
conservative they are.   Not politically, of course.  I mean they
don&apos;t seem to want to take risks.  This is a mistake, because the
younger you are, the more risk you can take.<br><br><b>Risk</b><br><br>Risk and reward are always proportionate.  For example, stocks are
riskier than bonds, and over time always have greater returns.  So
why does anyone invest in bonds?  The catch is that phrase &quot;over
time.&quot;  Stocks will generate greater returns over thirty years, but
they might lose value from year to year.  So what you should invest
in depends on how soon you need the money.  If you&apos;re young, you 
should take the riskiest investments you can find.<br><br>All this talk about investing may seem very theoretical.  Most
undergrads probably have more debts than assets.  They may feel
they have nothing to invest.  But that&apos;s not true: they have their
time to invest, and the same rule about risk applies there.  Your
early twenties are exactly the time to take insane career risks.<br><br>The reason risk is always proportionate to reward is that market  
forces make it so.  People will pay extra for stability.  So if you
choose stability-- by buying bonds, or by going to work for a big
company-- it&apos;s going to cost you.<br><br>Riskier career moves pay better on average, because there is less
demand for them.  Extreme choices like starting a startup are so  
frightening that most people won&apos;t even try.  So you don&apos;t end up   
having as much competition as you might expect, considering the
prizes at stake.<br><br>The math is brutal.  While perhaps 9 out of 10 startups fail, the  
one that succeeds will pay the founders more than 10 times what
they would have made in an ordinary job. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
That&apos;s the sense in
which startups pay better &quot;on average.&quot;<br><br>Remember that.  If you start a startup, you&apos;ll probably fail.  Most
startups fail. It&apos;s the nature of the business.  But it&apos;s not
necessarily a mistake to try something that has a 90% chance of
failing, if you can afford the risk.  Failing at 40, when you have 
a family to support, could be serious.  But if you fail at 22, so    
what?  If you try to start a startup right out of college and it   
tanks, you&apos;ll end up at 23 broke and a lot smarter.  Which, if you
think about it, is roughly what you hope to get from a graduate  
program.<br><br>Even if your startup does tank, you won&apos;t harm your prospects with
employers.  To make sure I asked some friends who work for big
companies.  I asked managers at Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Cisco and
Microsoft how they&apos;d feel about two candidates, both 24, with equal
ability, one who&apos;d tried to start a startup that tanked, and another
who&apos;d spent the two years since college working as a developer at
a big company.  Every one responded that they&apos;d prefer the guy who&apos;d
tried to start his own company.  Zod Nazem, who&apos;s in charge of       
engineering at Yahoo, said:
  <blockquote> I actually put more value on the guy with the failed
  startup.  And you can quote me!  </blockquote>
So there you have it.  Want to get hired by Yahoo?  Start your own 
company.<br><br><b>The Man is the Customer</b><br><br>If even big employers think highly of young hackers who start
companies, why don&apos;t more do it?  Why are undergrads so conservative?
I think it&apos;s because they&apos;ve spent so much time in institutions.<br><br>The first twenty years of everyone&apos;s life consists of being piped
from one institution to another.  You probably didn&apos;t have much
choice about the secondary schools you went to.  And after high
school it was probably understood that you were supposed to go to
college.  You may have had a few different colleges to choose
between, but they were probably pretty similar.  So by this point
you&apos;ve been riding on a subway line for twenty years, and the next
stop seems to be a job.<br><br>Actually college is where the line ends.  Superficially, going to
work for a company may feel like just the next in a series of      
institutions, but underneath, everything is different.  The end of
school is the fulcrum of your life, the point where you go from   
net consumer to net producer.<br><br>The other big change is that now, you&apos;re steering.  You can go
anywhere you want. So it may be worth standing back and understanding
what&apos;s going on, instead of just doing the default thing.<br><br>All through college, and probably long before that, most undergrads 
have been thinking about what employers want.  But what really 
matters is what customers want, because they&apos;re the ones who give
employers the money to pay you.<br><br>So instead of thinking about what employers want, you&apos;re probably
better off thinking directly about what users want.  To the extent 
there&apos;s any difference between the two, you can even use that to
your advantage if you start a company of your own.  For example,
big companies like docile conformists.  But this is merely an
artifact of their bigness, not something customers need.<br><br><b>Grad School</b><br><br>I didn&apos;t consciously realize all this when I was graduating from   
college-- partly because I went straight to grad school.  Grad
school can be a pretty good deal, even if you think of one day   
starting a startup.  You can start one when you&apos;re done, or even
pull the ripcord part way through, like the founders of Yahoo and
Google.<br><br>Grad school makes a good launch pad for startups, because you&apos;re
collected together with a lot of smart people, and you have bigger 
chunks of time to work on your own projects than an undergrad or
corporate employee would.  As long as you have a fairly tolerant
advisor, you can take your time developing an idea before turning   
it into a company.  David Filo and Jerry Yang started the Yahoo      
directory in February 1994 and were getting a million hits a day
by the fall, but they didn&apos;t actually drop out of grad school and
start a company till March 1995.<br><br>You could also try the startup first, and if it doesn&apos;t work, then
go to grad school.  When startups tank they usually do it fairly
quickly. Within a year you&apos;ll know if you&apos;re wasting your time.<br><br>If it fails, that is.  If it succeeds, you may have to delay grad
school a little longer.  But you&apos;ll have a much more enjoyable life  
once there than you would on a regular grad student stipend.<br><br><b>Experience</b><br><br>Another reason people in their early twenties don&apos;t start startups
is that they feel they don&apos;t have enough experience.  Most investors
feel the same.<br><br>I remember hearing a lot of that word &quot;experience&quot; when I was in  
college.  What do people really mean by it?  Obviously it&apos;s not the
experience itself that&apos;s valuable, but something it changes in your
brain.  What&apos;s different about your brain after you have &quot;experience,&quot;
and can you make that change happen faster?<br><br>I now have some data on this, and I can tell you what tends to be 
missing when people lack experience.  I&apos;ve said that every 
<a href="start.html">startup</a> needs three things: to start with good people,
to make something users want, and not to spend too much money.  It&apos;s
the middle one you get wrong when you&apos;re inexperienced.  There are   
plenty of undergrads with enough technical skill to write good
software, and undergrads are not especially prone to waste money.
If they get something wrong, it&apos;s usually not realizing they have   
to make something people <a href="bronze.html">want</a>.<br><br>This is not exclusively a failing of the young.  It&apos;s common for
startup founders of all ages to build things no one wants.<br><br>Fortunately, this flaw should be easy to fix.  If undergrads were  
all bad programmers, the problem would be a lot harder.  It can 
take years to learn how to program.  But I don&apos;t think it takes 
years to learn how to make things people want.  My hypothesis is
that all you have to do is smack hackers on the side of the head
and tell them: Wake up.  Don&apos;t sit here making up a priori theories
about what users need.  Go find some users and see what they need.<br><br>Most successful startups not only do something very specific, but  
solve a problem people already know they have.<br><br>The big change that &quot;experience&quot; causes in your brain is learning
that you need to solve people&apos;s problems.  Once you grasp that, you
advance quickly to the next step, which is figuring out what those
problems are.  And that takes some effort, because the way software
actually gets used, especially by the people who pay the most for
it, is not at all what you might expect.  For example, the stated  
purpose of Powerpoint is to present ideas.  Its real role is to 
overcome people&apos;s fear of public speaking.  It allows you to give
an impressive-looking talk about nothing, and it causes the audience
to sit in a dark room looking at slides, instead of a bright one     
looking at you.<br><br>This kind of thing is out there for anyone to see.  The key is to
know to look for it-- to realize that having an idea for a startup
is not like having an idea for a class project.  The goal in a
startup is not to write a cool piece of software.  It&apos;s to make 
something people want.  And to do that you have to look at users--
forget about hacking, and just look at users.  This can be quite a
mental adjustment, because little if any of the software you write
in school even has users.  <!-- Imagine the shock you'd feel if you
spent eight years practicing football drills and only then had to
play against an opposing team.  That's the scale of adjustment
involved. --><br><br>A few steps before a Rubik&apos;s Cube is solved, it still looks like a
mess.  I think there are a lot of undergrads whose brains are in a  
similar position: they&apos;re only a few steps away from being able to
start successful startups, if they wanted to, but they don&apos;t realize
it.  They have more than enough technical skill.  They just haven&apos;t
realized yet that the way to create wealth is to make what users   
want, and that employers are just proxies for users in which risk  
is pooled.<br><br>If you&apos;re young and smart, you don&apos;t need either of those.  You
don&apos;t need someone else to tell you what users want, because you  
can figure it out yourself.  And you don&apos;t want to pool risk, because
the younger you are, the more risk you should take.<br><br><b>A Public Service Message</b><br><br>I&apos;d like to conclude with a joint message from me and your parents.
Don&apos;t drop out of college to start a startup.  There&apos;s no rush.     
There will be plenty of time to start companies after you graduate.
In fact, it may be just as well to go work for an existing company
for a couple years after you graduate, to learn how companies work.<br><br>And yet, when I think about it, I can&apos;t imagine telling Bill Gates
at 19 that he should wait till he graduated to start a company.    
He&apos;d have told me to get lost.  And could I have honestly claimed
that he was harming his future-- that he was learning less by working
at ground zero of the microcomputer revolution than he would have
if he&apos;d been taking classes back at Harvard?  No, probably not.<br><br>And yes, while it is probably true that you&apos;ll learn some valuable
things by going to work for an existing company for a couple years
before starting your own, you&apos;d learn a thing or two running your  
own company during that time too.<br><br>The advice about going to work for someone else would get an even
colder reception from the 19 year old Bill Gates.  So I&apos;m supposed 
to finish college, then go work for another company for two years,
and then I can start my own?  I have to wait till I&apos;m 23?  That&apos;s  
<i>four years</i>.  That&apos;s more than twenty percent of my life so
far.  Plus in four years it will be way too late to make money     
writing a Basic interpreter for the Altair.<br><br>And he&apos;d be right.  The Apple II was launched just two years later.
In fact, if Bill had finished college and gone to work for another
company as we&apos;re suggesting, he might well have gone to work for
Apple.  And while that would probably have been better for all of
us, it wouldn&apos;t have been better for him.<br><br>So while I stand by our responsible advice to finish college and
then go work for a while before starting a startup, I have to admit
it&apos;s one of those things the old tell the young, but don&apos;t expect
them to listen to.  We say this sort of thing mainly so we can claim
we warned you.  So don&apos;t say I didn&apos;t warn you.<br><br><br><br>

Ten years ago there seemed a real danger Microsoft would extend its
monopoly to servers.  It seems safe to say now that open source has
prevented that.  A recent survey found 52% of companies are replacing
Windows servers with Linux servers.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>More significant, I think, is <i>which</i> 52% they are.  At this point,
anyone proposing to run Windows on servers should be prepared to
explain what they know about servers that Google, Yahoo, and Amazon
don&apos;t.<br><br>But the biggest thing business has to learn from open source is not
about Linux or Firefox, but about the forces that produced them.
Ultimately these will affect a lot more than what software you use.<br><br>We may be able to get a fix on these underlying forces by triangulating
from open source and blogging.  As you&apos;ve probably noticed, they
have a lot in common.<br><br>Like open source, blogging is something people do themselves, for
free, because they enjoy it.  Like open source hackers, bloggers
compete with people working for money, and often win.  The method
of ensuring quality is also the same: Darwinian.  Companies ensure
quality through rules to prevent employees from screwing up.  But
you don&apos;t need that when the audience can communicate with one
another.  People just produce whatever they want; the good stuff
spreads, and the bad gets ignored.  And in both cases, feedback
from the audience improves the best work.<br><br>Another thing blogging and open source have in common is the Web.
People have always been willing to do great work
for free,  but before the Web it was harder to reach an audience
or collaborate on projects.<br><br><b>Amateurs</b><br><br>I think the most important of the new principles business has to learn is
that people work a lot harder on stuff they like.  Well, that&apos;s
news to no one.  So how can I claim business has to learn it?  When
I say business doesn&apos;t know this, I mean the structure of business
doesn&apos;t reflect it.<br><br>Business still reflects an older model, exemplified by the French
word for working: <i>travailler</i>.  It has an English cousin, travail,
and what it means is torture.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>This turns out not to be the last word on work, however.
As societies get richer, they learn something about
work that&apos;s a lot like what they learn about diet.  We know now that the
healthiest diet is the one our peasant ancestors were forced to
eat because they were poor.  Like rich food, idleness
only seems desirable when you don&apos;t get enough of it.  I think we were
designed to work, just as we were designed to eat a certain amount
of fiber, and we feel bad if we don&apos;t.<br><br>There&apos;s a name for people who work for the love of it: amateurs.
The word now has such bad connotations that we forget its etymology,
though it&apos;s staring us in the face.  &quot;Amateur&quot; was originally rather
a complimentary word.  But the thing to be in the twentieth century
was professional, which amateurs, by definition, are not.<br><br>That&apos;s why the business world was so surprised by one lesson from
open source: that people working for love often surpass those working
for money.   Users don&apos;t switch from Explorer to Firefox because
they want to hack the source.  They switch because it&apos;s a better
browser.<br><br>It&apos;s not that Microsoft isn&apos;t trying.  They know controlling the
browser is one of the keys to retaining their monopoly.  The problem
is the same they face in operating systems: they can&apos;t pay people
enough to build something better than a group of inspired hackers
will build for free.<br><br>I suspect professionalism was always overrated-- not just in the
literal sense of working for money, but also connotations like
formality and detachment.  Inconceivable as it would have seemed
in, say, 1970, I think professionalism was largely a fashion,
driven by conditions that happened to exist in the twentieth century.<br><br>One of the most powerful of those was the existence of &quot;channels.&quot; Revealingly,
the same term was used for both products and information:  there
were distribution channels, and TV and radio channels.<br><br>It was the narrowness of such channels that made professionals
seem so superior to amateurs.  There were only a few jobs as
professional journalists, for example, so competition ensured the
average journalist was fairly good.  Whereas anyone can express
opinions about current events in a bar.  And so the average person
expressing his opinions in a bar sounds like an idiot compared to
a journalist writing about the subject.<br><br>On the Web, the barrier for publishing your ideas is even lower.
You don&apos;t have to buy a drink, and they even let kids in.
Millions of people are publishing online, and the average
level of what they&apos;re writing, as you might expect, is not very
good.  This has led some in the media to conclude that blogs don&apos;t
present much of a threat-- that blogs are just a fad.<br><br>Actually, the fad is the word &quot;blog,&quot;  at least the way the print
media now use it.  What they mean by &quot;blogger&quot; is not someone who
publishes in a weblog format, but anyone who publishes online.
That&apos;s going to become a problem as the Web becomes the default
medium for publication.  So I&apos;d
like to suggest an alternative word for someone who publishes online.
How about &quot;writer?&quot;<br><br>Those in the print media who dismiss the writing online because of
its low average quality are missing an important point: no one reads
the <i>average</i> blog.  In the old world of channels, it meant something
to talk about average quality, because that&apos;s what you were getting
whether you liked it or not.
But now you can read any writer you want.  So the average
quality of writing online isn&apos;t what the print media are competing
against.  They&apos;re competing against the best writing online.  And, 
like Microsoft, they&apos;re losing.<br><br>I know that from my own experience as a reader.  Though most print
publications are online, I probably
read two or three articles on individual people&apos;s sites for every
one I read on the site of a newspaper or magazine.<br><br>And when I read, say, New York Times stories, I never reach
them through the Times front page.   Most I find through aggregators
like Google News or Slashdot or Delicious. Aggregators show how
much <a href="http://reddit.com">better</a> 
you can do than the channel.  The New York Times front page is
a list of articles written by people who work for the New York Times.  Delicious
is a list of articles that are interesting.  And it&apos;s only now that
you can see the two side by side that you notice how little overlap there is.<br><br>Most articles in the print media are boring.  For example, the
president notices that a majority of voters now think invading Iraq
was a mistake, so he makes an address to the nation to drum up
support.  Where is the man bites dog in that?  I didn&apos;t hear the
speech, but I could probably tell you exactly what he said.  A
speech like that is, in the most literal sense, not news: there is
nothing <i>new</i> in it.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Nor is there anything new, except the names and places, in most
&quot;news&quot; about things going wrong.  A child is abducted; there&apos;s a
tornado; a ferry sinks; someone gets bitten by a shark; a small
plane crashes.  And what do you learn about the world from these
stories?  Absolutely nothing.  They&apos;re outlying data points; what
makes them gripping also makes them irrelevant.<br><br>As in software, when professionals produce such crap, it&apos;s not
surprising if amateurs can do better.  Live by the channel, die by
the channel: if you depend on an oligopoly, you sink into bad habits
that are hard to overcome when you suddenly get competition.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Workplaces</b><br><br>Another thing blogs and open source software have in common is that
they&apos;re often made by people working at home.  That may not seem
surprising.  But it should be.  It&apos;s the architectural equivalent
of a home-made aircraft shooting down an F-18.  Companies spend
millions to build office buildings for a single purpose: to be a
place to work.  And yet people working in their own homes,
which aren&apos;t even designed to be workplaces, end up
being more productive.<br><br>This proves something a lot of us have suspected.  The average
office is a miserable place to get work done.  And a lot of what
makes offices bad are the very qualities we associate with
professionalism.  The sterility
of offices is supposed to suggest efficiency.  But suggesting
efficiency is a different thing from actually being efficient.<br><br>The atmosphere of the average workplace is to productivity what
flames painted on the side of a car are to speed.  And it&apos;s not
just the way offices look that&apos;s bleak.  The way people act is just
as bad.<br><br>Things are different in a startup.  Often as not a startup begins
in an apartment.  Instead of matching beige cubicles
they have an assortment of furniture they bought used.  They work
odd hours, wearing the most casual of clothing.  They look at
whatever they want online without worrying whether it&apos;s &quot;work safe.&quot;
The cheery, bland language of the office is replaced by wicked humor.  And
you know what?  The company at this stage is probably the most
productive it&apos;s ever going to be.<br><br>Maybe it&apos;s not a coincidence.  Maybe some aspects of professionalism
are actually a net lose.<br><br>To me the most demoralizing aspect of the traditional office is
that you&apos;re supposed to be there at certain times.  There are usually
a few people in a company who really have to, but the reason most
employees work fixed hours is that the company can&apos;t measure their
productivity.<br><br>The basic idea behind office hours is that if you can&apos;t make people
work, you can at least prevent them from having fun.  If employees
have to be in the building a certain number of hours a day, and are
forbidden to do non-work things while there, then they must be
working.  In theory.  In practice they spend a lot of their time
in a no-man&apos;s land, where they&apos;re neither working nor having fun.<br><br>If you could measure how much work people did, many companies
wouldn&apos;t need any fixed workday. You could just say: this is what
you have to do.  Do it whenever you like, wherever you like.  If
your work requires you to talk to other people in the company, then
you may need to be here a certain amount.  Otherwise we don&apos;t care.<br><br>That may seem utopian, but it&apos;s what we told people who came to
work for our company.  There were no fixed office hours.  I never
showed up before 11 in the morning.  But we weren&apos;t saying this to
be benevolent.  We were saying: if you work here we expect you to
get a lot done.  Don&apos;t try to fool us just by being here a lot.<br><br>The problem with the facetime model is not just that it&apos;s demoralizing, but
that the people pretending to work interrupt
the ones actually working.  I&apos;m convinced the facetime model
is the main reason large organizations have so many meetings.
Per capita, large organizations accomplish very little.
And yet all those people have to be on site at least eight hours a
day.  When so much time goes in one end and so little achievement
comes out the other, something has to give.  And meetings are the
main mechanism for taking up the slack.<br><br>For one year I worked at a regular nine to five job, and I remember
well the strange, cozy feeling that comes over one during meetings.
I was very aware, because of the novelty, that I was being paid for
programming.  It seemed just amazing, as if there was a machine on
my desk that spat out a dollar bill every two minutes no matter
what I did.  Even while I was in the bathroom!  But because the
imaginary machine was always running, I felt I always ought to be
working. And so meetings felt wonderfully relaxing.  They
counted as work, just like programming, but they were so much easier.
All you had to do was sit and look attentive.<br><br>Meetings are like an opiate with a network effect.  So is email,
on a smaller scale.  And in addition to the direct cost in time,
there&apos;s the cost in fragmentation-- breaking people&apos;s day up into
bits too small to be useful.<br><br>You can see how dependent you&apos;ve become on something by removing
it suddenly.  So for big companies I propose the following experiment.
Set aside one day where meetings are forbidden-- where everyone has to
sit at their desk all day and work without interruption on
things they can do without talking to anyone else.
Some amount of communication is necessary in most jobs, but I&apos;m
sure many employees could find eight hours worth of stuff they could
do by themselves.  You could call it &quot;Work Day.&quot;<br><br>The other problem with pretend work
is that it often looks better than real work.  When I&apos;m
writing or hacking I spend as much time just thinking as I do
actually typing.  Half the time I&apos;m sitting drinking a cup of tea,
or walking around the neighborhood.  This is a critical phase--
this is where ideas come from-- and yet I&apos;d feel guilty doing this
in most offices, with everyone else looking busy.<br><br>It&apos;s hard to see how bad some practice is till you have something
to compare it to.  And that&apos;s one reason open source, and even blogging
in some cases, are so important.  They show us what real work looks like.<br><br>We&apos;re funding eight new startups at the moment.  A friend asked
what they were doing for office space, and seemed surprised when I
said we expected them to work out of whatever apartments they found
to live in.  But we didn&apos;t propose that to save money.  We did it
because we want their software to be good.  Working in crappy
informal spaces is one of the things startups do right without
realizing it.  As soon as you get into an office, work and life
start to drift apart.<br><br>That is one of the key tenets of professionalism. Work and life
are supposed to be separate.  But that part, I&apos;m convinced, is a 
mistake.<br><br><b>Bottom-Up</b><br><br>The third big lesson we can learn from open source and
blogging is that ideas can bubble up from the bottom, instead of
flowing down from the top.  Open source and blogging both work
bottom-up: people make what they want, and the best stuff
prevails.<br><br>Does this sound familiar?  It&apos;s the principle of a market economy.
Ironically, though open source and blogs are done for free, those
worlds resemble market economies, while most companies, for all
their talk about the value of free markets, are run internally like
communist states.<br><br>There are two forces that together steer design: ideas about
what to do next, and the enforcement of quality.  In the channel
era, both flowed down from the top.  For example, newspaper editors
assigned stories to reporters, then edited what they wrote.<br><br>Open source and blogging show us things don&apos;t have to work that
way.  Ideas and even the enforcement of quality can flow bottom-up.
And in both cases the results are not merely acceptable, but better.
For example, open source software is more reliable precisely because
it&apos;s open source; anyone can find mistakes.<br><br>The same happens with writing.  As we got close to publication, I
found I was very worried about the essays in 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596006624">Hackers
&amp; Painters</a>
that hadn&apos;t been online.  Once an essay has had a couple thousand
page views I feel reasonably confident about it.  But these had had 
literally orders of magnitude less scrutiny.  It felt like
releasing software without testing it.<br><br>That&apos;s what all publishing used to be like.  If
you got ten people to read a manuscript, you were lucky.  But I&apos;d
become so used to publishing online that the old method now seemed
alarmingly unreliable, like navigating by dead reckoning once you&apos;d
gotten used to a GPS.<br><br>The other thing I like about publishing online is that you can write
what you want and publish when you want.  Earlier this year I wrote
<a href="inequality.html">something</a> that seemed suitable for a magazine, so
I sent it to an editor I know.
As I was waiting to hear back, I found to my surprise that I was
hoping they&apos;d reject it.  Then I could put it online right away.
If they accepted it, it wouldn&apos;t be read by anyone for months, and
in the meantime I&apos;d have to fight word-by-word to save it from being
mangled by some twenty five year old copy editor.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Many employees would <i>like</i> to build great things for the companies
they work for, but more often than not management won&apos;t let them.
How many of us have heard stories of employees going to management
and saying, please let us build this thing to make money for you--
and the company saying no?  The most famous example is probably Steve Wozniak,
who originally wanted to build microcomputers for his then-employer, HP.
And they turned him down.  On the blunderometer, this episode ranks
with IBM accepting a non-exclusive license for DOS.  But I think this
happens all the time.  We just don&apos;t hear about it usually,
because to prove yourself right you have to quit
and start your own company, like Wozniak did.<br><br><b>Startups</b><br><br>So these, I think, are the three big lessons open source and blogging
have to teach business: (1) that people work harder on stuff they
like, (2) that the standard office environment is very unproductive,
and (3) that bottom-up often works better than top-down.<br><br>I can imagine managers at this point saying: what is this guy talking
about?  What good does it do me to know that my programmers
would be more productive
working at home on their own projects?  I need their asses in here
working on version 3.2 of our software, or we&apos;re never going to
make the release date.<br><br>And it&apos;s true, the benefit that specific manager could derive from
the forces I&apos;ve described is near zero.  When I say business can
learn from open source, I don&apos;t mean any specific business can.  I
mean business can learn about new conditions the same way a gene
pool does.  I&apos;m not claiming companies can get smarter, just that
dumb ones will die.<br><br>So what will business look like when it has assimilated the lessons
of open source and blogging?  I think the big obstacle preventing
us from seeing the future of business is the assumption that people
working for you have to be employees.  But think about what&apos;s going
on underneath:  the company has some money, and they pay it to the
employee in the hope that he&apos;ll make something worth more than they
paid him.  Well, there are other ways to arrange that relationship.
Instead of paying the guy money as a salary, why not give it to him
as investment?  Then instead of coming to your office to work on
your projects, he can work wherever he wants on projects of his own.<br><br>Because few of us know any alternative, we have no idea how much
better we could do than the traditional employer-employee relationship.
Such customs evolve with glacial slowness.  Our 
employer-employee relationship still retains a big chunk of
master-servant DNA.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>I dislike being on either end of it.
I&apos;ll work my ass off for a customer, but I resent being told what
to do by a boss.  And being a boss is also horribly frustrating; 
half the time it&apos;s easier just to do stuff yourself than to get
someone else to do it for you.
I&apos;d rather do almost anything than give or receive a
performance review.<br><br>On top of its unpromising origins, employment
has accumulated a lot of cruft over the years.  The list of what
you can&apos;t ask in job interviews is now so long that for convenience
I assume it&apos;s infinite.  Within the
office you now have to walk on eggshells lest anyone 
<a href="say.html">say</a> or do
something that makes the company prey to a lawsuit.  And God help
you if you fire anyone.<br><br>Nothing shows more clearly that employment is not an ordinary economic
relationship than companies being sued for firing people.  In any
purely economic relationship you&apos;re free to do what you want.  If
you want to stop buying steel pipe from one supplier and start
buying it from another, you don&apos;t have to explain why.  No one can
accuse you of <i>unjustly</i> switching pipe suppliers.  Justice implies
some kind of paternal obligation that isn&apos;t there in
transactions between equals.<br><br>Most of the legal restrictions on employers are intended to protect
employees.  But you can&apos;t have action without an equal and opposite
reaction.  You can&apos;t expect employers to have some kind of paternal
responsibility toward employees without putting employees in the
position of children.  And that seems a bad road to go down.<br><br>Next time you&apos;re in a moderately large city, drop by the main post
office and watch the body language of the people working there.
They have the same sullen resentment as children made to do
something they don&apos;t want to.  Their union has exacted pay
increases and work restrictions that would have been the envy of
previous generations of postal workers, and yet they don&apos;t seem any
happier for it.  It&apos;s demoralizing
to be on the receiving end of a paternalistic relationship, no
matter how cozy the terms.  Just ask any teenager.<br><br>I see the disadvantages of the employer-employee relationship because
I&apos;ve been on both sides of a better one: the investor-founder relationship.
I wouldn&apos;t claim it&apos;s painless.  When I was running a
startup, the thought of our investors used to keep me up at night.
And now that I&apos;m an <a href="http://ycombinator.com">investor</a>,
the thought of our startups keeps me
up at night.  All the pain of whatever problem you&apos;re trying to
solve is still there.
But the pain hurts less when it isn&apos;t
mixed with resentment.<br><br>I had the misfortune to participate in what amounted to a controlled
experiment to prove that.  After Yahoo bought our startup I went
to work for them.  I was doing exactly the same work, except with
bosses.  And to my horror I started acting like a child.  The 
situation pushed buttons I&apos;d forgotten
I had.<br><br>The big advantage of investment over employment, as the examples of open
source and blogging suggest, is that people working on projects of
their own are enormously more productive.  And a
<a href="start.html">startup</a> is a project
of one&apos;s own in two senses, both of them important: it&apos;s creatively
one&apos;s own, and also economically ones&apos;s own.<br><br>Google is a rare example of a big company in tune with the forces
I&apos;ve described. They&apos;ve tried hard to make their offices less sterile
than the usual cube farm.  They give employees who do great work
large grants of stock to simulate the rewards of a startup.  They
even let hackers spend 20% of their time on their own projects.<br><br>Why not let people spend 100% of their time on their own projects,
and instead of trying to approximate the value of what they create,
give them the actual market value?  Impossible?  That is in fact
what venture capitalists do.<br><br>So am I claiming that no one is going to be an employee anymore--
that everyone should go and start a startup?  Of course not.
But more people could do it than do it now.
At the moment, even the smartest students leave school thinking
they have to get a <a href="hiring.html">job</a>.  
Actually what they need to do is make
something valuable.  A job is one way to do that, but the more
ambitious ones will ordinarily be better off taking money from an
investor than an employer.<br><br>Hackers tend to think business is for MBAs.  But business
administration is not what you&apos;re doing in a startup.  What you&apos;re
doing is business <i>creation</i>.  And the first phase of that
is mostly product creation-- that is, hacking.  That&apos;s the
hard part.  It&apos;s a lot harder to create something people love than
to take something people love and figure out how to make money from
it.<br><br>Another thing that keeps people away from starting startups is the
risk.  Someone with kids and a mortgage should think twice before
doing it.  But most young hackers have neither.<br><br>And as the example of open source and blogging suggests, you&apos;ll
enjoy it more, even if you fail.  You&apos;ll be working on your own
thing, instead of going to some office and doing what you&apos;re told.
There may be more pain in your own company, but it won&apos;t hurt as
much.<br><br>That may be the greatest effect, in the long run, of the forces 
underlying open source and blogging: finally ditching the old
paternalistic employer-employee relationship, and replacing it with
a purely economic one, between equals.<br><br><br><br>

ladder.  That&apos;s less the rule now.  Our generation wants to get
paid up front.  Instead of developing a product for some big company
in the expectation of getting job security in return, we develop
the product ourselves, in a startup, and sell it to the big company.
At the very least we want options.<br><br>Among other things, this shift has created the appearance of a rapid
increase in economic inequality.  But really the two cases are not
as different as they look in economic statistics.<br><br>Economic statistics are misleading because they ignore the value
of safe jobs.  An easy job from which one can&apos;t be fired is worth
money; exchanging the two is one of the commonest forms of
corruption.  A sinecure is, in effect, an annuity.  Except sinecures
don&apos;t appear in economic statistics.  If they did, it would be clear
that in practice socialist countries have nontrivial disparities
of wealth, because they usually have a class of powerful bureaucrats
who are paid mostly by seniority and can never be fired.<br><br>While not a sinecure, a position on the corporate ladder was genuinely
valuable, because big companies tried not to fire people, and
promoted from within based largely on seniority.  A position on the
corporate ladder had a value analogous to the &quot;goodwill&quot; that is a
very real element in the valuation of companies.  It meant one could
expect future high paying jobs.<br><br>One of main causes of the decay of the corporate ladder is the trend
for takeovers that began in the 1980s.  Why waste your time climbing
a ladder that might disappear before you reach the top?<br><br>And, by no coincidence, the corporate ladder was one of the reasons
the early corporate raiders were so successful.  It&apos;s not only
economic statistics that ignore the value of safe jobs.  Corporate
balance sheets do too.  One reason it was profitable to carve up 1980s
companies and sell them for parts was that they hadn&apos;t formally
acknowledged their implicit debt to employees who had done good
work and expected to be rewarded with high-paying executive jobs
when their time came.<br><br>In the movie <i>Wall Street</i>, Gordon Gekko
ridicules a company overloaded with vice presidents.  But the company
may not be as corrupt as it seems; those VPs&apos; cushy jobs were
probably payment for work done earlier.<br><br>I like the new model better.  For one thing, it seems a bad plan
to treat jobs as rewards.  Plenty of good engineers got made into
bad managers that way.  And the old system meant people had to deal
with a lot more corporate politics, in order to protect the work
they&apos;d invested in a position on the ladder.<br><br>The big disadvantage of the new system is that it involves more <a href="inequality.html">risk</a>.  If you develop ideas in a startup instead
of within a big company, any number of random factors could sink
you before you can finish.  But maybe the older generation would
laugh at me for saying that the way we do things is riskier.  After
all, projects within big companies were always getting cancelled
as a result of arbitrary decisions from higher up.  My father&apos;s
entire industry (breeder reactors) disappeared that way.<br><br>For better or worse, the idea of the corporate ladder is probably
gone for good.  The new model seems more liquid, and more efficient.
But it is less of a change, financially, than one might think.  Our
fathers weren&apos;t <i>that</i> stupid.<br><br><br><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://ro.goobix.com/pg/ladder/">Romanian Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/lionfan/20060111">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="inequality">Inequality and Risk</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">August 2005<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at Defcon 2005.)</i><br><br>Suppose you wanted to get rid of economic inequality.  There are
two ways to do it: give money to the poor, or take it away from the 
rich.  But they amount to the same thing, because if you want to
give money to the poor, you have to get it from somewhere.  You
can&apos;t get it from the poor, or they just end up where they started.
You have to get it from the rich.<br><br>There is of course a way to make the poor richer without simply
shifting money from the rich.  You could help the poor become more
productive-- for example, by improving access to education.  Instead
of taking money from engineers and giving it to checkout clerks,
you could enable people who would have become checkout clerks to
become engineers.<br><br>This is an excellent strategy for making the poor richer.  But the
evidence of the last 200 years shows that it doesn&apos;t reduce economic
inequality, because it makes the rich richer too.  If there
are more engineers, then there are more opportunities to hire them
and to sell them things.  Henry Ford couldn&apos;t have made a fortune  
building cars in a society in which most people were still subsistence
farmers; he would have had neither workers nor customers.<br><br>If you want to reduce economic inequality instead of just improving
the overall standard of living, it&apos;s not enough just to raise up  
the poor.  What if one of your newly minted engineers gets ambitious
and goes on to become another Bill Gates?  Economic inequality will
be as bad as ever.  If you actually want to compress the gap between
rich and poor, you have to push down on the top as well as pushing
up on the bottom.<br><br>How do you push down on the top?  You could try to decrease the
productivity of the people who make the most money: make the best   
surgeons operate with their left hands, force popular actors to
overeat, and so on.  But this approach is hard to implement.  The
only practical solution is to let people do the best work they can,
and then (either by taxation or by limiting what they can charge)
to confiscate whatever you deem to be surplus.<br><br>So let&apos;s be clear what reducing economic inequality means.  It is   
identical with taking money from the rich.<br><br>When you transform a mathematical expression into another form, you
often notice new things.  So it is in this case.  Taking money from
the rich turns out to have consequences one might not foresee when
one phrases the same idea in terms of &quot;reducing inequality.&quot;<br><br>The problem is, risk and reward have to be proportionate.  A bet  
with only a 10% chance of winning has to pay more than one with a
50% chance of winning, or no one will take it.  So if you lop off
the top of the possible rewards, you thereby decrease people&apos;s
willingness to take risks.<br><br>Transposing into our original expression, we get: decreasing economic
inequality means decreasing the risk people are willing to take.<br><br>There are whole classes of risks that are no longer worth taking    
if the maximum return is decreased.  One reason high tax rates are
disastrous is that this class of risks includes starting new
companies.<br><br><b>Investors</b><br><br>Startups are intrinsically risky.  A startup
is like a small boat
in the open sea.  One big wave and you&apos;re sunk.  A competing product,
a downturn in the economy, a delay in getting funding or regulatory
approval, a patent suit, changing technical standards, the departure
of a key employee, the loss of a big account---any one of these can
destroy you overnight.  It seems only about 1 in 10 startups succeeds.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Our startup paid its first round of outside investors 36x.  Which   
meant, with current US tax rates, that it made sense to invest in
us if we had better than a 1 in 24 chance of succeeding.  That  
sounds about right.  That&apos;s probably roughly how we looked when we
were a couple of nerds with no business experience operating out
of an apartment.<br><br>If that kind of risk doesn&apos;t pay, venture investing, as we know it,
doesn&apos;t happen.<br><br>That might be ok if there were other sources of capital for new
companies.  Why not just have the government, or some large
almost-government organization like Fannie Mae, do the venture
investing instead of private funds?<br><br>I&apos;ll tell you why that wouldn&apos;t work. Because then you&apos;re asking
government or almost-government employees to do the one thing they 
are least able to do: take risks.<br><br>As anyone who has worked for the government knows, the important
thing is not to make the right choices, but to make choices that
can be justified later if they fail.  If there is a safe option,
that&apos;s the one a bureaucrat will choose.   But that is exactly the  
wrong way to do venture investing.  The nature of the business means
that you want to make terribly risky choices, if the upside looks
good enough.<br><br>VCs are currently 
<a href="venturecapital.html">paid</a> in a way that makes them 
focus on the upside:
they get a percentage of the fund&apos;s gains.  And that helps overcome
their understandable fear of investing in a company run by nerds
who look like (and perhaps are) college students.<br><br>If VCs weren&apos;t allowed to get rich, they&apos;d behave like bureaucrats.
Without hope of gain, they&apos;d have only fear of loss.  And so they&apos;d
make the wrong choices.  They&apos;d turn down the nerds in favor of the
smooth-talking MBA in a suit, because that investment would be
easier to justify later if it failed.<br><br><b>Founders</b><br><br>But even if you could somehow redesign venture funding to work
without allowing VCs to become rich, there&apos;s another kind of investor
you simply cannot replace: the startups&apos; founders and early employees.<br><br>What they invest is their time and ideas.  But these are equivalent
to money; the proof is that investors are willing (if forced) to
treat them as interchangeable, granting the same status to &quot;sweat   
equity&quot; and the equity they&apos;ve purchased with cash.<br><br>The fact that you&apos;re investing time doesn&apos;t change the relationship
between risk and reward.  If you&apos;re going to invest your time in
something with a small chance of succeeding, you&apos;ll only do it if
there is a proportionately large payoff.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>
If large payoffs aren&apos;t allowed, you may as well play it safe.<br><br>Like many startup founders, I did it to get rich.  But not because 
I wanted to buy expensive things.  What I wanted was security.  I   
wanted to make enough money that I didn&apos;t have to worry about money.
If I&apos;d been forbidden to make enough from a startup to do this, I
would have sought security by some other means: for example, by
going to work for a big, stable organization from which it would
be hard to get fired.  Instead of busting my ass in a startup, I    
would have tried to get a nice, low-stress job at a big research 
lab, or tenure at a university.<br><br>That&apos;s what everyone does in societies where risk isn&apos;t rewarded.
If you can&apos;t ensure your own security, the next best thing is to
make a nest for yourself in some large organization where your
status depends mostly on <a href="ladder.html">seniority</a>.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Even if we could somehow replace investors, I don&apos;t see how we could
replace founders.  Investors mainly contribute money, which in
principle is the same no matter what the source.  But the founders
contribute ideas.  You can&apos;t replace those.<br><br>Let&apos;s rehearse the chain of argument so far.  I&apos;m heading for a 
conclusion to which many readers will have to be dragged kicking   
and screaming, so I&apos;ve tried to make each link unbreakable.  Decreasing
economic inequality means taking money from the rich.  Since risk
and reward are equivalent, decreasing potential rewards automatically
decreases people&apos;s appetite for risk.  Startups are intrinsically
risky.  Without the prospect of rewards proportionate to the risk,
founders will not invest their time in a startup.  Founders are
irreplaceable.  So eliminating economic inequality means eliminating
startups.<br><br>Economic inequality is not just a consequence of startups.
It&apos;s the engine that drives them, in the same way a fall of water   
drives a water mill.  People start startups in the hope of becoming
much richer than they were before.  And if your society tries to
prevent anyone from being much richer than anyone else, it will
also prevent one person from being much richer at t2 than t1.<br><br><b>Growth</b><br><br>This argument applies proportionately.  It&apos;s not just that if you  
eliminate economic inequality, you get no startups.  To the extent 
you reduce economic inequality, you decrease the number of startups.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
Increase taxes, and willingness to take risks decreases in
proportion.<br><br>And that seems bad for everyone.  New technology and new jobs both
come disproportionately from new companies.  Indeed, if you don&apos;t
have startups, pretty soon you won&apos;t have established companies
either, just as, if you stop having kids, pretty soon you won&apos;t
have any adults.<br><br>It sounds benevolent to say we ought to reduce economic inequality. 
When you phrase it that way, who can argue with you?  <i>Inequality</i>
has to be bad, right?  It sounds a good deal less benevolent to say
we ought to reduce the rate at which new companies are founded.
And yet the one implies the other.<br><br>Indeed, it may be that reducing investors&apos; appetite for risk doesn&apos;t
merely kill off larval startups, but kills off the most promising
ones especially.  Startups yield faster growth at greater risk than
established companies.  Does this trend also hold among startups?
That is, are the riskiest startups the ones that generate most
growth if they succeed?  I suspect the answer is yes.  And that&apos;s   
a chilling thought, because it means that if you cut investors&apos;
appetite for risk, the most beneficial startups are the first to 
go.<br><br>Not all rich people got that way from startups, of course.  What
if we let people get rich by starting startups, but taxed away all
other surplus wealth?  Wouldn&apos;t that at least decrease inequality?<br><br>Less than you might think.  If you made it so that people could
only get rich by starting startups, people who wanted to get rich
would all start startups.  And that might be a great thing.  But I
don&apos;t think it would have much effect on the distribution of wealth.
People who want to get rich will do whatever they have to.  If
startups are the only way to do it, you&apos;ll just get far more people
starting startups.  (If you write the laws very carefully, that is.
More likely, you&apos;ll just get a lot of people doing things that can
be made to look on paper like startups.)<br><br>If we&apos;re determined to eliminate economic inequality, there is still
one way out: we could say that we&apos;re willing to go ahead and do
without startups.  What would happen if we did?<br><br>At a minimum, we&apos;d have to accept lower rates of technological   
growth.  If you believe that large, established companies could   
somehow be made to develop new technology as fast as startups, the
ball is in your court to explain how.  (If you can come up with a   
remotely plausible story, you can make a fortune writing business
books and consulting for large companies.)
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Ok, so we get slower growth.  Is that so bad?  Well, one reason
it&apos;s bad in practice is that other countries might not agree to
slow down with us.  If you&apos;re content to develop new technologies
at a slower rate than the rest of the world, what happens is that
you don&apos;t invent anything at all.  Anything you might discover has
already been invented elsewhere.  And the only thing you can offer 
in return is raw materials and cheap labor.  Once you sink that
low, other countries can do whatever they like with you: install
puppet governments, siphon off your best workers, use your women
as prostitutes, dump their toxic waste on your territory-- all the
things we do to poor countries now.  The only defense is to isolate
yourself, as communist countries did in the twentieth century.  But
the problem then is, you have to become a police state to enforce 
it.
<!-- Eliminating economic inequality means eliminating startups, and to
the extent you do that, you're hosed. --><br><br><b>Wealth and Power</b><br><br>I realize startups are not the main target of those who want to
eliminate economic inequality.   What they really dislike is the
sort of wealth that becomes self-perpetuating through an alliance
with power. For example, construction firms that fund politicians&apos;
campaigns in return for government contracts, or rich parents who   
get their children into good colleges by sending them to expensive
schools designed for that purpose.  But if you try to attack this type of wealth
through <i>economic</i> policy, it&apos;s hard to hit without destroying
startups as collateral damage.<br><br>The problem here is not wealth, but corruption.  So why not go after
corruption?<br><br>We don&apos;t need to prevent people from being rich if we can prevent
wealth from translating into power.  And there has been progress
on that front.  Before he died of drink in 1925, Commodore Vanderbilt&apos;s
wastrel grandson Reggie ran down pedestrians on five separate   
occasions, killing two of them.  By 1969, when Ted Kennedy drove  
off the bridge at Chappaquiddick, the limit seemed to be down to  
one.  Today it may well be zero.  But what&apos;s changed is not variation
in wealth.  What&apos;s changed is the ability to translate wealth into
power.<br><br>How do you break the connection between wealth and power?  Demand   
transparency.  Watch closely how power is exercised, and demand an
account of how decisions are made.  Why aren&apos;t all police interrogations
videotaped?  Why did 36% of Princeton&apos;s class of 2007 come from
prep schools, when only 1.7% of American kids attend them?  Why did
the US really invade Iraq?  Why don&apos;t government officials disclose
more about their finances, and why only during their term of office?<br><br>A friend of mine who knows a lot about computer security says the
single most important step is to log everything.  Back when he was
a kid trying to break into computers, what worried him most was the
idea of leaving a trail.  He was more inconvenienced by the need 
to avoid that than by any obstacle deliberately put in his path.<br><br>Like all illicit connections, the connection between wealth and     
power flourishes in secret.  Expose all transactions, and you will
greatly reduce it.  Log everything.  That&apos;s a strategy that already
seems to be working, and it doesn&apos;t have the side effect of making
your whole country poor.<br><br>I don&apos;t think many people realize there is a connection between
economic inequality and risk.  I didn&apos;t fully grasp it till recently.
I&apos;d known for years of course that if one didn&apos;t score in a startup,
the other alternative was to get a cozy, tenured research job.  But
I didn&apos;t understand the equation governing my behavior.  Likewise, 
it&apos;s obvious empirically that a country that doesn&apos;t let people get
rich is headed for disaster, whether it&apos;s Diocletian&apos;s Rome or  
Harold Wilson&apos;s Britain.  But I did not till recently understand
the role risk played.<br><br>If you try to attack wealth, you end up nailing risk as well, and  
with it growth.  If we want a fairer world, I think we&apos;re better  
off attacking one step downstream, where wealth turns into power.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>

Success here is defined from the initial investors&apos; point of
view: either an IPO, or an acquisition for more than the valuation
at the last round of funding.  The conventional 1 in 10 success rate
is suspiciously neat, but conversations with VCs suggest it&apos;s roughly
correct for startups overall.  Top VC firms expect to do better.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
I&apos;m not claiming founders sit down and calculate the expected     
after-tax return from a startup.  They&apos;re motivated by examples of
other people who did it.  And those examples do reflect after-tax returns.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Conjecture: The variation in wealth in a (non-corrupt) 
country or organization
will be inversely proportional to the prevalence of systems of
seniority.  So if you suppress variation in wealth, seniority will
become correspondingly more important.  So far, I know of no
counterexamples, though in very corrupt countries you may get 
both simultaneously.  (Thanks to Daniel Sobral for pointing
this out.)<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
In a country with a truly feudal economy, you might be able to
redistribute wealth successfully, because there are no startups to
kill.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
The speed at which startups develop new techology is the other     
reason they pay so well.  As I explained in &quot;How to Make Wealth&quot;  
(in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596006624">Hackers
&amp; Painters</a>), what you do in a startup is compress a
lifetime&apos;s worth of work into a few years.  It seems as
dumb to discourage that as to discourage risk-taking.<br><br>

We were
surprised how well it went.  Overall only about 10% of startups   
succeed, but if I had to guess now, I&apos;d predict three or four of  
the eight startups we funded will make it.<br><br>Of the startups that needed further funding, I believe all have
either closed a round or are likely to soon.  Two have already
turned down (lowball) acquisition offers.<br><br>We would have been happy if just one of the eight seemed promising
by the end of the summer.  What&apos;s going on?  Did some kind of anomaly
make this summer&apos;s applicants especially good?  We worry about that,
but we can&apos;t think of one.  We&apos;ll find out this <xa href="http://ycombinator.com/wfp2006.html">winter.<br><br>The whole summer was full of surprises.  The best was that the <a href="hiring.html">hypothesis</a> we were testing seems to be
correct.  Young hackers can start viable companies.  This is good
news for two reasons: (a) it&apos;s an encouraging thought, and (b) it 
means that Y Combinator, which is predicated on the idea, is not
hosed.<br><br><b>Age</b><br><br>More precisely, the hypothesis was that success in a startup depends
mainly on how smart and energetic you are, and much less on how old
you are or how much business experience you have.  The results so
far bear this out.  The 2005 summer founders ranged in age from 18  
to 28 (average 23), and there is no correlation between their ages
and how well they&apos;re doing.<br><br>This should not really be surprising. Bill Gates and Michael Dell 
were both 19 when they started the companies that made them famous.
Young founders are not a new phenomenon: the trend began as soon
as computers got cheap enough for college kids to afford them.<br><br>Another of our hypotheses was that you can start a startup on less
money than most people think.  Other investors were surprised to
hear the most we gave any group was $20,000.  But we knew it was
possible to start on that little because we started Viaweb on
$10,000.<br><br>And so it proved this summer.  Three months&apos; funding is enough to
get into second gear.  We had a demo day for potential investors
ten weeks in, and seven of the eight groups had a prototype ready
by that time.  One, <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>, had
already launched, and were able to give a demo of their live site.<br><br>A researcher who studied the SFP startups said the one thing they 
had in common was that they all worked ridiculously hard.  People
this age are commonly seen as lazy.  I think in some cases it&apos;s not
so much that they lack the appetite for work, but that the work
they&apos;re offered is unappetizing.<br><br>The experience of the SFP suggests that if you let motivated people
do real work, they work hard, whatever their age.  As one of the
founders said &quot;I&apos;d read that starting a startup consumed your life,  
but I had no idea what that meant until I did it.&quot;<br><br>I&apos;d feel guilty if I were a boss making people work this hard.  But
we&apos;re not these people&apos;s bosses.  They&apos;re working on their own
projects.  And what makes them work is not us but their competitors.
Like good athletes, they don&apos;t work hard because the coach yells
at them, but because they want to win.<br><br>We have less power than bosses, and yet the founders work harder  
than employees.  It seems like a win for everyone.  The only catch
is that we get on average only about 5-7% of the upside, while an
employer gets nearly all of it.  (We&apos;re counting on it being 5-7%
of a much larger number.)<br><br>As well as working hard, the groups all turned out to be extraordinarily
responsible.  I can&apos;t think of a time when one failed to do something
they&apos;d promised to, even by being late for an appointment.  This
is another lesson the world has yet to learn.  One of the founders
discovered that the hardest part of arranging a meeting with
executives at a big cell phone carrier was getting a rental company
to rent him a car, because he was too young.<br><br>I think the problem here is much the same as with the apparent
laziness of people this age.  They seem lazy because the work they&apos;re
given is pointless, and they act irresponsible because they&apos;re not
given any power.  Some of them, anyway.  We only have a sample size
of about twenty, but it seems so far that if you let people in their
early twenties be their own bosses, they rise to the occasion.<br><br><b>Morale</b><br><br>The summer founders were as a rule very idealistic.  They also  
wanted very much to get rich.  These qualities might seem incompatible,
but they&apos;re not.  These guys want to get rich, but they want to do
it by changing the world.  They wouldn&apos;t (well, seven of the eight
groups wouldn&apos;t) be interested in making money by speculating in
stocks.  They want to make something people use.<br><br>I think this makes them more effective as founders.  As hard as  
people will work for money, they&apos;ll work harder for a cause.  And   
since success in a startup depends so much on motivation, the
paradoxical result is that the people likely to make the most money
are those who aren&apos;t in it just for the money.<br><br>The founders of <a href="http://kiko.com">Kiko</a>, for example,   
are working on an Ajax calendar.  They want to get rich, but they
pay more attention to design than they would if that were their
only motivation.  You can tell just by looking at it.<br><br>I never considered it till this summer, but this might be another
reason startups run by hackers tend to do better than those run by
MBAs.  Perhaps it&apos;s not just that hackers understand technology
better, but that they&apos;re driven by more powerful motivations.
Microsoft, as I&apos;ve said before, is a dangerously misleading example.  
Their mean corporate culture only works for monopolies.   
Google is a better model.<br><br>Considering that the summer founders are the sharks in this ocean,
we were surprised how frightened most of them were of competitors.
But now that I think of it, we were just as frightened when we
started Viaweb.  For the first year, our initial reaction to news 
of a competitor was always: we&apos;re doomed.  Just as a hypochondriac
magnifies his symptoms till he&apos;s convinced he has some terrible
disease, when you&apos;re not used to competitors you magnify them into
monsters.<br><br>Here&apos;s a handy rule for startups: competitors are rarely as dangerous
as they seem.  Most will self-destruct before you can destroy them.
And it certainly doesn&apos;t matter how many of them there are, any
more than it matters to the winner of a marathon how many runners
are behind him.<br><br>&quot;It&apos;s a crowded market,&quot; I remember one founder saying worriedly.<br><br>&quot;Are you the current leader?&quot; I asked.<br><br>&quot;Yes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is anyone able to develop software faster than you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Probably not.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, if you&apos;re ahead now, and you&apos;re the fastest, then you&apos;ll
stay ahead.  What difference does it make how many others there
are?&quot;<br><br>Another group was worried when they realized they had to rewrite
their software from scratch.  I told them it would be a bad sign
if they didn&apos;t.  The main function of your initial version is to  
be rewritten.<br><br>That&apos;s why we advise groups to ignore issues like scalability,
internationalization, and heavy-duty security at first. [1] I can
imagine an advocate of &quot;best practices&quot; saying these ought to be
considered from the start.  And he&apos;d be right, except that they
interfere with the primary function of software in a startup: to  
be a vehicle for experimenting with its own design.  Having to
retrofit internationalization or scalability is a pain, certainly.  
The only bigger pain is not needing to, because your initial version
was too big and rigid to evolve into something users wanted.<br><br>I suspect this is another reason startups beat big companies.
Startups can be irresponsible and release version 1s that are light
enough to evolve.  In big companies, all the pressure is in the   
direction of over-engineering.<br><br><b>What Got Learned</b><br><br>One thing we were curious about this summer was where these groups  
would need help.  That turned out to vary a lot.  Some we helped
with technical advice-- for example, about how to set up an application
to run on multiple servers.  Most we helped with strategy questions,
like what to patent, and what to charge for and what to give away.
Nearly all wanted advice about dealing with future investors: how  
much money should they take and what kind of terms should they
expect?<br><br>However, all the groups quickly learned how to deal with stuff like
patents and investors.  These problems aren&apos;t intrinsically difficult,
just unfamiliar.<br><br>It was surprising-- slightly frightening even-- how fast they
learned.  The weekend before the demo day for investors, we had a  
practice session where all the groups gave their presentations.  
They were all terrible.  We tried to explain how to make them better,
but we didn&apos;t have much hope.  So on demo day I told the assembled
angels and VCs that these guys were hackers, not MBAs, and so while
their software was good, we should not expect slick presentations 
from them.<br><br>The groups then proceeded to give fabulously slick presentations. 
Gone were the mumbling recitations of lists of features.   It was
as if they&apos;d spent the past week at acting school.  I still don&apos;t 
know how they did it.<br><br>Perhaps watching each others&apos; presentations helped them see what
they&apos;d been doing wrong.  Just as happens in college, the summer   
founders learned a lot from one another-- maybe more than they
learned from us.  A lot of the problems they face are the same,  
from dealing with investors to hacking Javascript.<br><br>I don&apos;t want to give the impression there were no problems this  
summer.  A lot went wrong, as usually happens with startups.  One
group got an &quot;<a href="http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2003/000024.html">exploding
term-sheet</a>&quot; from some VCs.  Pretty much all the groups who had
dealings with big companies found that big companies do everything
infinitely slowly.  (This is to be expected.  If big companies
weren&apos;t incapable, there would be no room for startups to exist.)
And of course there were the usual nightmares associated with
servers.  <!-- When Kiko's server went down after they got slashdotted,
the guy in charge of the server was in China and had to fix it from
there. --><br><br>In short, the disasters this summer were just the usual childhood
diseases.  Some of this summer&apos;s eight startups will   
probably die eventually; it would be extraordinary if all eight 
succeeded.  But what kills them will not be dramatic, external    
threats, but a mundane, internal one: not getting enough done.<br><br>So far, though, the news is all good.  In fact, we were surprised
how much fun the summer was for us.  The main reason was how much
we liked the founders.  They&apos;re so earnest and hard-working.  They
seem to like us too.  And this illustrates another advantage of
investing over hiring: our relationship with them is way better   
than it would be between a boss and an employee.  Y Combinator ends
up being more like an older brother than a parent.<br><br>I was surprised how much time I spent making introductions.
Fortunately I discovered that when a startup needed to talk to
someone, I could usually get to the right person by at most one
hop.  I remember wondering, how did my friends get to be so eminent?
and a second later realizing: shit, I&apos;m forty.<br><br>Another surprise was that the three-month batch format,
which we were forced into by the constraints of the summer, turned
out to be an advantage.  When we started Y Combinator, we planned
to invest the way other venture firms do: as proposals came in,     
we&apos;d evaluate them and decide yes or no.  The SFP
was just an experiment to get things started.  But it worked so
well that we plan to do 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com/funding.html">all</a> 
our investing this way, one cycle in
the summer and one in winter.  It&apos;s more efficient for us, and
better for the startups too.<br><br>Several groups said our weekly dinners saved them from a common
problem afflicting startups: working so hard that one has no social
life.  (I remember that part all too well.)  This way, they were
guaranteed a social event at least once a week.<br><br><b>Independence</b><br><br>I&apos;ve heard Y Combinator described as an &quot;incubator.&quot;  Actually we&apos;re
the opposite: incubators exert more control than ordinary VCs, and
we make a point of exerting less.  Among other things, incubators
usually make you work in their office-- that&apos;s where the 
word &quot;incubator&quot; comes from.  That seems the wrong model.  If
investors get too involved, they smother one of the most powerful 
forces in a startup: the feeling that it&apos;s your own company.<br><br>Incubators were conspicuous failures during the Bubble.  There&apos;s  
still debate about whether this was because of the Bubble, or because
they&apos;re a bad idea.  My vote is they&apos;re a bad idea.  I think they 
fail because they select for the wrong people.  When we were starting
a startup, we would never have taken funding from an &quot;incubator.&quot;
We can find office space, thanks; just give us the money.  And  
people with that attitude are the ones likely to succeed in startups.<br><br>Indeed, one quality all the founders shared this summer was a spirit
of independence.  I&apos;ve been wondering about that.  Are some people
just a lot more independent than others, or would everyone be this
way if they were allowed to?<br><br>As with most nature/nurture questions, the answer is probably: some
of each.  But my main conclusion from the summer is that there&apos;s
more environment in the mix than most people realize.  I could see
that from how the founders&apos; attitudes <i>changed</i> during the   
summer.  Most were emerging from twenty or so years of being told
what to do.  They seemed a little surprised at having total freedom.
But they grew into it really quickly; some of these guys now seem
about four inches taller (metaphorically) than they did at the
beginning of the summer.<br><br>When we asked the summer founders what surprised them most about
starting a company, one said &quot;the most shocking thing is that it 
worked.&quot;<br><br>It will take more experience to know for sure, but my guess is that
a lot of hackers could do this-- that if you put people in a position
of independence, they develop the qualities they need.  Throw them
off a cliff, and most will find on the way down that they have   
wings.<br><br>The reason this is news to anyone is that the same forces work in
the other direction too. Most hackers are 
employees, and this <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/No_Great_Hackers.html">molds</a>
you into someone to whom starting a startup seems impossible as
surely as starting a startup molds you into someone who can handle
it.<br><br>If I&apos;m right, &quot;hacker&quot; will mean something different in twenty years
than it does now. Increasingly it will mean the people who run the
company.  Y Combinator is just accelerating a process that would
have happened anyway.  Power is shifting from the people who deal
with money to the people who create technology, and if our experience
this summer is any guide, this will be a good thing.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] By heavy-duty security I mean efforts to protect against truly

<p>
October 2005<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2005 
<a href="http://startupschool.org">Startup School.</a>)</i><br><br>How do you get good ideas for 
<a href="start.html">startups</a>?  That&apos;s probably the number
one question people ask me.<br><br>I&apos;d like to reply with another question: why do people think it&apos;s
hard to come up with ideas for startups?<br><br>That might seem a stupid thing to ask.  Why do they <i>think</i>
it&apos;s hard?  If people can&apos;t do it, then it <i>is</i> hard, at least
for them.  Right?<br><br>Well, maybe not.  What people usually say is not that they can&apos;t
think of ideas, but that they don&apos;t have any.  That&apos;s not quite the
same thing.  It could be the reason they don&apos;t have any is that
they haven&apos;t tried to generate them.<br><br>I think this is often the case.  I think people believe that coming
up with ideas for startups is very hard-- that it <i>must</i> be
very hard-- and so they don&apos;t try do to it.  They assume ideas are
like miracles: they either pop into your head or they don&apos;t.<br><br>I also have a theory about why people think this.  They overvalue
ideas.  They think creating a startup is just a matter of implementing
some fabulous initial idea.  And since a successful startup is worth
millions of dollars, a good idea is therefore a million dollar idea.<br><br>If coming up with an idea for a startup equals coming up with a
million dollar idea, then of course it&apos;s going to seem hard.  Too
hard to bother trying.  Our instincts tell us something so valuable
would not be just lying around for anyone to discover.<br><br>Actually, startup ideas are not million dollar ideas, and here&apos;s
an experiment you can try to prove it: just try to sell one.  Nothing
evolves faster than markets.  The fact that there&apos;s no market for
startup ideas suggests there&apos;s no demand.  Which means, in the
narrow sense of the word, that startup ideas are worthless.<br><br><b>Questions</b><br><br>The fact is, most startups end up nothing like the initial idea.
It would be closer to the truth to say the main value of your initial
idea is that, in the process of discovering it&apos;s broken, you&apos;ll
come up with your real idea.<br><br>The initial idea is just a starting point-- not a blueprint, but a
question.  It might help if they were expressed that way.  Instead
of saying that your idea is to make a collaborative, web-based
spreadsheet, say: could one make a collaborative, web-based
spreadsheet?  A few grammatical tweaks, and a woefully incomplete
idea becomes a promising question to explore.<br><br>There&apos;s a real difference, because an assertion provokes objections
in a way a question doesn&apos;t.  If you say: I&apos;m going to build a
web-based spreadsheet, then critics-- the most dangerous of which
are in your own head-- will immediately reply that you&apos;d be competing
with Microsoft, that you couldn&apos;t give people the kind of UI they
expect, that users wouldn&apos;t want to have their data on your servers,
and so on.<br><br>A question doesn&apos;t seem so challenging.  It becomes: let&apos;s try
making a web-based spreadsheet and see how far we get.  And everyone
knows that if you tried this you&apos;d be able to make <i>something</i>
useful.  Maybe what you&apos;d end up with wouldn&apos;t even be a spreadsheet.
Maybe it would be some kind of new spreasheet-like collaboration
tool that doesn&apos;t even have a name yet.  You wouldn&apos;t have thought
of something like that except by implementing your way toward it.<br><br>Treating a startup idea as a question changes what you&apos;re looking
for.  If an idea is a blueprint, it has to be right.  But if it&apos;s
a question, it can be wrong, so long as it&apos;s wrong in a way that
leads to more ideas.<br><br>One valuable way for an idea to be wrong is to be only a partial
solution.  When someone&apos;s working on a problem that seems too
big, I always ask: is there some way to bite off some subset of the
problem, then gradually expand from there?  That will generally
work unless you get trapped on a local maximum, like 1980s-style
AI, or C.<br><br><b>Upwind</b><br><br>So far, we&apos;ve reduced the problem from thinking of a million dollar
idea to thinking of a mistaken question.  That doesn&apos;t seem so hard,
does it?<br><br>To generate such questions you need two things: to be familiar with 
promising new technologies, and to have the right kind of friends.
New technologies are the ingredients startup ideas are made of, and
conversations with friends are the kitchen they&apos;re cooked in.<br><br>Universities have both, and that&apos;s why so many startups grow out
of them.  They&apos;re filled with new technologies, because they&apos;re
trying to produce research, and only things that are new count as
research.  And they&apos;re full of exactly the right kind of people to   
have ideas with: the other students, who will be not only smart but
elastic-minded to a fault.<br><br>The opposite extreme would be a well-paying but boring job at a big
company.  Big companies are biased against new technologies, and
the people you&apos;d meet there would be wrong too.<br><br>In an <a href="hs.html">essay</a> I wrote for high school students,  
I said a good rule of thumb was to stay upwind-- to
work on things that maximize your future options. The principle
applies for adults too, though perhaps it has to be modified to:
stay upwind for as long as you can, then cash in the potential
energy you&apos;ve accumulated when you need to pay for kids.<br><br>I don&apos;t think people consciously realize this, but one reason
downwind jobs like churning out Java for a bank pay so well is   
precisely that they are downwind.  The market price for that kind
of work is higher because it gives you fewer options for the future.
A job that lets you work on exciting new stuff will tend to pay
less, because part of the compensation is in the form of the new
skills you&apos;ll learn.<br><br>Grad school is the other end of the spectrum from a coding job at
a big company: the pay&apos;s low but you spend most of your time working
on new stuff.  And of course, it&apos;s called &quot;school,&quot; which makes
that clear to everyone, though in fact all jobs are some percentage
school.<br><br>The right environment for having startup ideas need not be a
university per se.  It just has to be a situation with a large
percentage of school.<br><br>It&apos;s obvious why you want exposure to new technology, but why do 
you need other people?  Can&apos;t you just think of new ideas yourself?
The empirical answer is: no.  Even Einstein needed people to bounce
ideas off.  Ideas get developed in the process of explaining them
to the right kind of person.  You need that resistance, just
as a carver needs the resistance of the wood.<br><br>This is one reason Y Combinator has a rule against investing in 
startups with only one founder.  Practically every successful company
has at least two.  And because startup founders work under great   
pressure, it&apos;s critical they be friends.<br><br>I didn&apos;t realize it till I was writing this, but that may help
explain why there are so few female startup founders.  I read on
the Internet (so it must be true) that only 1.7% of VC-backed
startups are founded by women.  The percentage of female hackers
is small, but not that small.  So why the discrepancy?<br><br>When you realize that successful startups tend to have multiple
founders who were already friends, a
possible explanation emerges.  People&apos;s best friends are likely to  
be of the same sex, and if one group is a minority in some population,
<i>pairs</i> of them will be a minority squared.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Doodling</b><br><br>What these groups of co-founders do together is more complicated 
than just sitting down and trying to think of ideas.  I suspect the  
most productive setup is a kind of together-alone-together sandwich.
Together you talk about some hard problem, probably getting nowhere.
Then, the next morning, one of you has an idea in the shower about
how to solve it.  He runs eagerly to to tell the others, and together
they work out the kinks.<br><br>What happens in that shower?  It seems to me that ideas just pop
into my head.  But can we say more than that?<br><br>Taking a shower is like a form of meditation.  You&apos;re alert, but
there&apos;s nothing to distract you.  It&apos;s in a situation like this,
where your mind is free to roam, that it bumps into new ideas.<br><br>What happens when your mind wanders?  It may be like doodling.  Most
people have characteristic ways of doodling.  This habit is  
unconscious, but not random: I found my doodles changed after I 
started studying painting.  I started to make the kind of gestures
I&apos;d make if I were drawing from life.  They were atoms of drawing,  
but arranged randomly.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Perhaps letting your mind wander is like doodling with ideas.  You
have certain mental gestures you&apos;ve learned in your work, and when
you&apos;re not paying attention, you keep making these same gestures,   
but somewhat randomly.  In effect, you call the same functions on
random arguments.  That&apos;s what a metaphor is: a function applied   
to an argument of the wrong type.<br><br>Conveniently, as I was writing this, my mind wandered: would it be
useful to have metaphors in a programming language?  I don&apos;t know;
I don&apos;t have time to think about this.  But it&apos;s convenient because
this is an example of what I mean by habits of mind.  I spend a lot
of time thinking about language design, and my habit of always   
asking &quot;would x be useful in a programming language&quot; just got
invoked.<br><br>If new ideas arise like doodles, this would explain why you have
to work at something for a while before you have any.  It&apos;s not
just that you can&apos;t judge ideas till you&apos;re an expert in a field.
You won&apos;t even generate ideas, because you won&apos;t have any habits
of mind to invoke.<br><br>Of course the habits of mind you invoke on some field don&apos;t have
to be derived from working in that field.  In fact, it&apos;s often
better if they&apos;re not.  You&apos;re not just looking for good ideas, but
for good <i>new</i> ideas, and you have a better chance of generating
those if you combine stuff from distant fields.  As hackers, one
of our habits of mind is to ask, could one open-source x?  For  
example, what if you made an open-source operating system?  A fine
idea, but not very novel.  Whereas if you ask, could you make an
open-source play?  you might be onto something.<br><br>Are some kinds of work better sources of habits of mind than others?
I suspect harder fields may be better sources, because to attack
hard problems you need powerful solvents.  I find math is a good
source of metaphors-- good enough that it&apos;s worth studying just for
that.  Related fields are also good sources, especially when they&apos;re
related in unexpected ways.  Everyone knows computer science and
electrical engineering are related, but precisely because everyone
knows it, importing ideas from one to the other doesn&apos;t yield great
profits.  It&apos;s like importing something from Wisconsin to Michigan.  
Whereas (I claim) hacking and <a href="hp.html">painting</a> are
also related, in the sense that hackers and painters are both 
<a href="taste.html">makers</a>,
and this source of new ideas is practically virgin territory.<br><br><b>Problems</b><br><br>In theory you could stick together ideas at random and see what you
came up with.  What if you built a peer-to-peer dating site?  Would
it be useful to have an automatic book?  Could you turn theorems
into a commodity?  When you assemble ideas at random like this, 
they may not be just stupid, but semantically ill-formed.  What 
would it even mean to make theorems a commodity?  You got me.  I
didn&apos;t think of that idea, just its name.<br><br>You might come up with something useful this way, but I never have.
It&apos;s like knowing a fabulous sculpture is hidden inside a block of
marble, and all you have to do is remove the marble that isn&apos;t part
of it.  It&apos;s an encouraging thought, because it reminds you there   
is an answer, but it&apos;s not much use in practice because the search
space is too big.<br><br>I find that to have good ideas I need to be working on some problem.
You can&apos;t start with randomness.  You have to start with a problem,
then let your mind wander just far enough for new ideas to form.<br><br>In a way, it&apos;s harder to see problems than their solutions.  Most  
people prefer to remain in denial about problems.  It&apos;s obvious
why: problems are irritating.  They&apos;re problems!  Imagine if people
in 1700 saw their lives the way we&apos;d see them.  It would have been
unbearable.  This denial is such a powerful force that, even when 
presented with possible solutions, people often prefer to believe
they wouldn&apos;t work.<br><br>I saw this phenomenon when I worked on spam filters.  In 2002, most
people preferred to ignore spam, and most of those who didn&apos;t
preferred to believe the heuristic filters then available were the
best you could do.<br><br>I found spam intolerable, and I felt it had to be possible to
recognize it statistically.  And it turns out that was all you  
needed to solve the problem.  The algorithm I used was ridiculously
simple.  Anyone who&apos;d really tried to solve the problem would have
found it.  It was just that no one had really tried to solve the
problem.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Let me repeat that recipe: finding the problem intolerable and  
feeling it must be possible to solve it.  Simple as it seems, that&apos;s
the recipe for a lot of startup ideas.<br><br><b>Wealth</b><br><br>So far most of what I&apos;ve said applies to ideas in general.  What&apos;s  
special about startup ideas?  Startup ideas are ideas for companies,
and companies have to make money.  And the way to make money is to
make something people want.<br><br>Wealth is what people want.  I don&apos;t mean that as some kind of  
philosophical statement; I mean it as a tautology.<br><br>So an idea for a startup is an idea for something people want.
Wouldn&apos;t any good idea be something people want?  Unfortunately 
not.  I think new theorems are a fine thing to create, but there
is no great demand for them.  Whereas there appears to be great
demand for celebrity gossip magazines.  Wealth is defined democratically.
Good ideas and valuable ideas are not quite the same thing; the
difference is individual tastes.<br><br>But valuable ideas are very close to good ideas, especially in
technology.  I think they&apos;re so close that you can get away with
working as if the goal were to discover good ideas, so long as, in
the final stage, you stop and ask: will people actually pay for 
this?  Only a few ideas are likely to make it that far and then get
shot down; RPN calculators might be one example.<br><br>One way to make something people want is to look at stuff people   
use now that&apos;s broken.  Dating sites are a prime example.  They   
have millions of users, so they must be promising something people 
want.  And yet they work horribly.  Just ask anyone who uses them.  
It&apos;s as if they used the worse-is-better approach but stopped after
the first stage and handed the thing over to marketers.<br><br>Of course, the most obvious breakage in the average computer user&apos;s 
life is Windows itself.  But this is a special case: you can&apos;t
defeat a monopoly by a frontal attack.  Windows can and will be     
overthrown, but not by giving people a better desktop OS.  The way
to kill it is to redefine the problem as a superset of the current 
one.  The problem is not, what operating system should people use
on desktop computers?  but how should people use applications?
There are answers to that question that don&apos;t even involve desktop
computers.<br><br>Everyone thinks Google is going to solve this problem, but it is a
very subtle one, so subtle that a company as big as Google might
well get it wrong.  I think the odds are better than 50-50 that the
Windows killer-- or more accurately, Windows transcender-- will
come from some little startup.<br><br>Another classic way to make something people want is to take a
luxury and make it into a commmodity.  People must want something
if they pay a lot for it.  And it is a very rare product that can&apos;t
be made dramatically cheaper if you try.<br><br>This was Henry Ford&apos;s plan.  He made cars, which had been a luxury
item, into a commodity.  But the idea is much older than Henry Ford.
Water mills transformed mechanical power from a luxury into a
commodity, and they were used in the Roman empire.  Arguably
pastoralism transformed a luxury into a commodity.<br><br>When you make something cheaper you can sell more of them.  But if
you make something dramatically cheaper you often get qualitative
changes, because people start to use it in different ways.  For
example, once computers get so cheap that most people can have one
of their own, you can use them as communication devices.<br><br>Often to make something dramatically cheaper you have to redefine 
the problem.  The Model T didn&apos;t have all the features previous
cars did.  It only came in black, for example.  But it solved the
problem people cared most about, which was getting from place to
place.<br><br>One of the most useful mental habits I know I learned from Michael
Rabin: that the best way to solve a problem is often to redefine
it.  A lot of people use this technique without being consciously
aware of it, but Rabin was spectacularly explicit.  You need a big
prime number?  Those are pretty expensive.  How about if I give you
a big number that only has a 10 to the minus 100 chance of not being
prime?  Would that do?  Well, probably; I mean, that&apos;s probably
smaller than the chance that I&apos;m imagining all this anyway.<br><br>Redefining the problem is a particularly juicy heuristic when you
have competitors, because it&apos;s so hard for rigid-minded people to 
follow.  You can work in plain sight and they don&apos;t realize the 
danger.  Don&apos;t worry about us. We&apos;re just working on search.  Do   
one thing and do it well, that&apos;s our motto.<br><br>Making things cheaper is actually a subset of a more general
technique: making things easier.  For a long time it was most of  
making things easier, but now that the things we build are so
complicated, there&apos;s another rapidly growing subset: making things  
easier to <i>use</i>.<br><br>This is an area where there&apos;s great room for improvement.  What you
want to be able to say about technology is: it just works.  How
often do you say that now?<br><br>Simplicity takes effort-- genius, even.  The average programmer   
seems to produce UI designs that are almost willfully bad. I was   
trying to use the stove at my mother&apos;s house a couple weeks ago. 
It was a new one, and instead of physical knobs it had buttons and
an LED display.  I tried pressing some buttons I thought would cause
it to get hot, and you know what it said?  &quot;Err.&quot;  Not even &quot;Error.&quot;
&quot;Err.&quot;  You can&apos;t just say &quot;Err&quot; to the user of a <i>stove</i>.
You should design the UI so that errors are impossible.  And the  
boneheads who designed this stove even had an example of such a UI
to work from: the old one.  You turn one knob to set the temperature
and another to set the timer.  What was wrong with that?  It just
worked.<br><br>It seems that, for the average engineer, more options just means
more rope to hang yourself.  So if you want to start a startup, you
can take almost any existing technology produced by a big company, 
and assume you could build something way easier to use.<br><br><b>Design for Exit</b><br><br>Success for a startup approximately equals getting bought.  You
need some kind of exit strategy, because you can&apos;t get the smartest
people to work for you without giving them options likely to be
worth something.  Which means you either have to get bought or go
public, and the number of startups that go public is very small.<br><br>If success probably means getting bought, should you make that a
conscious goal?  The old answer was no: you were supposed to pretend
that you wanted to create a giant, public company, and act surprised
when someone made you an offer.  Really, you want to buy us? Well,
I suppose we&apos;d consider it, for the right price.<br><br>I think things are changing.  If 98% of the time success means   
getting bought, why not be open about it?  If 98% of the time you&apos;re
doing product development on spec for some big company, why not
think of that as your task?  One advantage of this approach is that
it gives you another source of ideas: look at big companies, think
what they <a href="http://kiko.com">should</a> 
be doing, and do it yourself.  Even if
they already know it, you&apos;ll probably be done faster.<br><br>Just be sure to make something multiple acquirers will want.  Don&apos;t
fix Windows, because the only potential acquirer is Microsoft, and  
when there&apos;s only one acquirer, they don&apos;t have to hurry.  They can
take their time and copy you instead of buying you.  If you want
to get market price, work on something where there&apos;s competition.<br><br>If an increasing number of startups are created to do product
development on spec, it will be a natural counterweight to monopolies.
Once some type of technology is captured by a monopoly, it will    
only evolve at big company rates instead of startup rates, whereas
alternatives will evolve with especial speed.  A free market
interprets monopoly as damage and routes around it.<br><br><b>The Woz Route</b><br><br>The most productive way to generate startup ideas is also the
most unlikely-sounding: by accident.  If you look at how famous
startups got started, a lot of them weren&apos;t initially supposed to  
be startups.  Lotus began with a program Mitch Kapor wrote for a
friend. Apple got started because Steve Wozniak wanted to build
microcomputers, and his employer, Hewlett-Packard, wouldn&apos;t let him
do it at work.  Yahoo began as David Filo&apos;s personal collection of
links.<br><br>This is not the only way to start startups.  You can sit down and
consciously come up with an idea for a company; we did.  But measured
in total market cap, the build-stuff-for-yourself model might be  
more fruitful.  It certainly has to be the most fun way to come up
with startup ideas.  And since a startup ought to have multiple
founders who were already friends before they decided to start a 
company, the rather surprising conclusion is that the best way to   
generate startup ideas is to do what hackers do for fun: cook up
amusing hacks with your friends.<br><br>It seems like it violates some kind of conservation law, but there
it is: the best way to get a &quot;million dollar idea&quot; is just to do
what hackers enjoy doing anyway.<br><br><br><br>

squeezed from four directions.  They&apos;re already stuck with a seller&apos;s
market, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the
Bubble and still haven&apos;t invested.  This by itself is not the end
of the world.  In fact, it&apos;s just a more extreme version of the
<a href="http://www.archub.org/dilbertvc.gif">norm</a>
in the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.<br><br>Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because
it&apos;s getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open

server; and if you make something good you can generate ten times
as much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got
through the print media.<br><br>And of course another big change for the average startup is that
programming languages have improved-- or rather, the <a href="avg.html">median language</a> has.  At most startups ten years
ago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in
C++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python
or Ruby.<br><br>During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would
outsource their development to India.  I think a better model for
the future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development
to a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications
are now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one
guy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won&apos;t waste
any time in meetings, and (b) since he&apos;s probably a founder, he can
pay himself nothing.<br><br>Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now
often want to give startups more money than the startups want to
take.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one
VC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a
million, &quot;I don&apos;t know what we&apos;re going to do.  Maybe we&apos;ll just
have to give some of it back.&quot; Meaning give some of the fund back
to the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn&apos;t
going to be possible to invest it all.<br><br>Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.
Sarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically
increases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition
to the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a
year, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate
officers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: &quot;I would not
want to be CFO of a public company now.&quot;<br><br>You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area
where you can&apos;t go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and
this remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO
is both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If
Sarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  
companies, that&apos;s proof enough that it&apos;s broken.<br><br>Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For
all practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which
means VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3
man startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100
million to acquire.   They didn&apos;t mean to be in this business; it&apos;s
just what their business has evolved into.<br><br>Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they
can buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups
they want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don&apos;t
want anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR
departments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,
and that&apos;s what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated
software and developers.<br><br>Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.
&quot;Bring us your startups early,&quot; said Google&apos;s speaker at the <a href="http://startupschool.org">Startup School</a>.  They&apos;re quite
explicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point
where they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the
first round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first
year.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology
companies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have 
still more of their lunch eaten by Google.<br><br>Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the
people there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.
Ordinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;
it&apos;s just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich
when you&apos;re still working for salary.  Even if it&apos;s the right thing   
for your company to do.<br><br><b>The Solution(s)</b><br><br>Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.
They need to do two things, one of which won&apos;t surprise them, and  
another that will seem an anathema.<br><br>Let&apos;s start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  
loosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to
destroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead
when it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now 
that technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly
what a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.<br><br>Startups are fragile plants&#x2014;seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings
are worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the
economy.  Much of the economy&apos;s growth is their growth.  I think
most politicians realize that.  But they don&apos;t realize just how   
fragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral
damage of laws meant to fix some other problem.<br><br>Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very
little noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you&apos;ll
hear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,
all that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in 
grad school instead of starting a company.<br><br>My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  
out partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest
in a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the 
money goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from
the founders as well.<br><br>Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They
don&apos;t want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes
public.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they&apos;ll
have less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.<br><br>This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock
early would generally be better for the company, because it would
cause the founders&apos; attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the
VCs&apos;.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend
to be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would
prefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,
while the VCs can afford to be &quot;rational&quot; and prefer the latter.<br><br>Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies
early instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up
front.  That first million is just worth so much more than the
subsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,
they&apos;d be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger
outcome.<br><br>So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least
half million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   
money.  So what if some of the money would go to the  
founders instead of the company?<br><br>Some VCs will say this is
unthinkable&#x2014;that they want all their money to be put to work
growing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC
investments is dictated by the <a href="venturecapital.html">structure</a>
of VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  
investments go to work destroying the company rather than growing
it.<br><br>The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell
some stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. 
The angels made a huge return on that investment, so they&apos;re happy.
And for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness
of a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a
motivator.<br><br>If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially
cash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you
are now competing directly with Google.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>
November 2005<br><br><!-- <i>(This 
article is meant to be a complete summary of funding options
for startup founders.  In effect we're open-sourcing the kernel of
what we tell founders about funding at <nota href="http://ycombinator.com">Y
Combinator</a>.)</i>
-->
Venture funding works like gears.  A typical startup goes through
several rounds of funding, and at each round you want to take just
enough money to reach the speed where you can shift into the next
gear.<br><br>Few startups get it quite right.  Many are underfunded.  A few are
overfunded, which is like trying to start driving in third gear.<br><br>I think it would help founders to understand funding better&#x2014;not
just the mechanics of it, but what investors are thinking.  I was
surprised recently when I realized that all the worst problems we
faced in our startup were due not to competitors, but investors.
Dealing with competitors was easy by comparison.<br><br>I don&apos;t mean to suggest that our investors were nothing but a drag
on us.  They were helpful in negotiating deals, for example.  I
mean more that conflicts with investors are particularly nasty.
Competitors punch you in the jaw, but investors have you by the
balls.<br><br>Apparently our situation was not unusual.  And if trouble with
investors is one of the biggest threats to a startup, managing them
is one of the most important skills founders need to learn.<br><br>Let&apos;s start by talking about the five sources of startup funding.
Then we&apos;ll trace the life of a hypothetical (very fortunate) startup
as it shifts gears through successive rounds.<br><br><b>Friends and Family</b><br><br>A lot of startups get their first funding from friends and family.
Excite did, for example: after the founders graduated from college,
they borrowed $15,000 from their parents to start a company.  With
the help of some part-time jobs they made it last 18 months.<br><br>If your friends or family happen to be rich, the line blurs between
them and angel investors.  At Viaweb we got our first $10,000 of
seed money from our friend Julian, but he was sufficiently rich
that it&apos;s hard to say whether he should be classified as a friend
or angel.  He was also a lawyer, which was great, because it meant
we didn&apos;t have to pay legal bills out of that initial small sum.<br><br>The advantage of raising money from friends and family is that
they&apos;re easy to find.  You already know them.  There are three main
disadvantages: you mix together your business and personal life;
they will probably not be as well connected as angels or venture
firms; and they may not be accredited investors, which could
complicate your life later.<br><br>The SEC defines an &quot;accredited investor&quot; as someone with over a
million dollars in liquid assets or an income of over $200,000 a
year.  The regulatory burden is much lower if a company&apos;s shareholders
are all accredited investors.  Once you take money from the general
public you&apos;re more restricted in what you can do. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>A startup&apos;s life will be more complicated, legally, if any of the
investors aren&apos;t accredited.  In an IPO, it might not merely add
expense, but change the outcome. A lawyer I asked about it said:
<blockquote>
  When the company goes public, the SEC will carefully study all
  prior issuances of stock by the company and demand that it take
  immediate action to cure any past violations of securities laws.
  Those remedial actions can delay, stall or even kill the IPO.
</blockquote>
Of course the odds of any given startup doing an IPO are small.
But not as small as they might seem. A lot of startups that end up
going public didn&apos;t seem likely to at first. (Who could have guessed
that the company Wozniak and Jobs started in their spare time selling
plans for microcomputers would yield one of the biggest IPOs of the
decade?) Much of the value of a startup consists of that tiny
probability multiplied by the huge outcome.<br><br>It wasn&apos;t because they weren&apos;t accredited investors that I didn&apos;t
ask my parents for seed money, though.  When we were starting Viaweb,
I didn&apos;t know about the concept of an accredited investor, and
didn&apos;t stop to think about the value of investors&apos; connections.
The reason I didn&apos;t take money from my parents was that I didn&apos;t
want them to lose it.<br><br><b>Consulting</b><br><br>Another way to fund a startup is to get a job.  The best sort of
job is a consulting project in which you can build whatever software
you wanted to sell as a startup.  Then you can gradually transform
yourself from a consulting company into a product company, and have
your clients pay your development expenses.<br><br>This is a good plan for someone with kids, because it takes most
of the risk out of starting a startup.  There never has to be a
time when you have no revenues.  Risk and reward are usually
proportionate, however: you should expect a plan that cuts the risk
of starting a startup also to cut the average return.  In this case,
you trade decreased financial risk for increased risk that your
company won&apos;t succeed as a startup.<br><br>But isn&apos;t the consulting company itself a startup?  No, not generally.
A company has to be more than small and newly founded to be a
startup.  There are millions of small businesses in America, but
only a few thousand are startups.  To be a startup, a company has
to be a product business, not a service business.  By which I mean
not that it has to make something physical, but that it has to have
one thing it sells to many people, rather than doing custom work
for individual clients.  Custom work doesn&apos;t scale.  To be a startup
you need to be the band that sells a million copies of a song, not
the band that makes money by playing at individual weddings and bar
mitzvahs.<br><br>The trouble with consulting is that clients have an awkward habit
of calling you on the phone.  Most startups operate close to the
margin of failure, and the distraction of having to deal with clients
could be enough to put you over the edge.  Especially if you have
competitors who get to work full time on just being a startup.<br><br>So you have to be very disciplined if you take the consulting route.
You have to work actively to prevent your company growing into a
&quot;weed tree,&quot; dependent on this source of easy but low-margin money.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Indeed, the biggest danger of consulting may be that it gives you
an excuse for failure.  In a startup, as in grad school, a lot of
what ends up driving you are the expectations of your family and
friends.  Once you start a startup and tell everyone that&apos;s what
you&apos;re doing, you&apos;re now on a path labelled &quot;get rich or bust.&quot; You
now have to get rich, or you&apos;ve failed.<br><br>Fear of failure is an extraordinarily powerful force.  Usually it
prevents people from starting things, but once you publish some
definite ambition, it switches directions and starts working in
your favor.  I think it&apos;s a pretty clever piece of jiujitsu to set
this irresistible force against the slightly less immovable object
of becoming rich.  You won&apos;t have it driving you if your stated
ambition is merely to start a consulting company that you will one
day morph into a startup.<br><br>An advantage of consulting, as a way to develop a product, is that
you know you&apos;re making something at least one customer wants.  But
if you have what it takes to start a startup you should have
sufficient vision not to need this crutch.<br><br><b>Angel Investors</b><br><br><i>Angels</i> are individual rich people.  The word was first used
for backers of Broadway plays, but now applies to individual investors
generally.  Angels who&apos;ve made money in technology are preferable,
for two reasons: they understand your situation, and they&apos;re a
source of contacts and advice.<br><br>The contacts and advice can be more important than the money.  When
del.icio.us took money from investors, they took money from, among
others, Tim O&apos;Reilly.  The amount he put in was small compared to
the VCs who led the round, but Tim is a smart and influential guy
and it&apos;s good to have him on your side.<br><br>You can do whatever you want with money from consulting or friends
and family.  With angels we&apos;re now talking about venture funding
proper, so it&apos;s time to introduce the concept of <i>exit strategy</i>.
Younger would-be founders are often surprised that investors expect
them either to sell the company or go public.  The reason is that
investors need to get their capital back.  They&apos;ll only consider
companies that have an exit strategy&#x2014;meaning companies that could
get bought or go public.<br><br>This is not as selfish as it sounds.  There are few large, private
technology companies.  Those that don&apos;t fail all seem to get bought
or go public.  The reason is that employees are investors too&#x2014;of
their time&#x2014;and they want just as much to be able to cash out.  If
your competitors offer employees stock options that might make them
rich, while you make it clear you plan to stay private, your
competitors will get the best people. So the principle of an &quot;exit&quot;
is not just something forced on startups by investors, but part of
what it means to be a startup.<br><br>Another concept we need to introduce now is valuation.  When someone
buys shares in a company, that implicitly establishes a value for
it.  If someone pays $20,000 for 10% of a company, the company is
in theory worth $200,000.  I say &quot;in theory&quot; because in early stage
investing, valuations are voodoo.  As a company gets more established,
its valuation gets closer to an actual market value.  But in a newly
founded startup, the valuation number is just an artifact of the
respective contributions of everyone involved.<br><br>Startups often &quot;pay&quot; investors who will help the company in some
way by letting them invest at low valuations.  If I had a startup
and Steve Jobs wanted to invest in it, I&apos;d give him the stock for
$10, just to be able to brag that he was an investor.  Unfortunately,
it&apos;s impractical (if not illegal) to adjust the valuation of the
company up and down for each investor.  Startups&apos; valuations are
supposed to rise over time.  So if you&apos;re going to sell cheap stock
to eminent angels, do it early, when it&apos;s natural for the company
to have a low valuation.<br><br>Some angel investors join together in syndicates.  Any city where
people start startups will have one or more of them.  In Boston the
biggest is the <a href="http://commonangels.com/home.html">Common
Angels</a>.  In the Bay Area it&apos;s the <a href="http://bandangels.com/">Band
of Angels</a>.  You can find groups near you through the <a href="http://angelcapitalassociation.org/">Angel Capital Association</a>.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
However, most angel investors don&apos;t belong to these groups.  In
fact, the more prominent the angel, the less likely they are to
belong to a group.<br><br>Some angel groups charge you money to pitch your idea to them.
Needless to say, you should never do this.<br><br>One of the dangers of taking investment from individual angels,
rather than through an angel group or investment firm, is that they
have less reputation to protect.  A big-name VC firm will not screw
you too outrageously, because other founders would avoid them if
word got out.  With individual angels you don&apos;t have this protection,
as we found to our dismay in our own startup.  In many startups&apos;
lives there comes a point when you&apos;re at the investors&apos; 
mercy&#x2014;when you&apos;re out of money and the only place to get more is your
existing investors.  When we got into such a scrape, our investors
took advantage of it in a way that a name-brand VC probably wouldn&apos;t
have.<br><br>Angels have a corresponding advantage, however: they&apos;re also not
bound by all the rules that VC firms are.  And so they can, for
example, allow founders to cash out partially in a funding round,
by selling some of their stock directly to the investors.  I think
this will become more common; the average founder is eager to do
it, and selling, say, half a million dollars worth of stock will
not, as VCs fear, cause most founders to be any less committed to
the business.<br><br>The same angels who tried to screw us also let us do this, and so
on balance I&apos;m grateful rather than angry.  (As in families, relations
between founders and investors can be complicated.)<br><br>The best way to find angel investors is through personal introductions.
You could try to cold-call angel groups near you, but angels, like
VCs, will pay more attention to deals recommended by someone they
respect.<br><br>Deal terms with angels vary a lot.  There are no generally accepted
standards.  Sometimes angels&apos; deal terms are as fearsome as VCs&apos;.
Other angels, particularly in the earliest stages, will invest based
on a two-page agreement.<br><br>Angels who only invest occasionally may not themselves know what
terms they want.  They just want to invest in this startup.  What
kind of anti-dilution protection do they want?  Hell if they know.
In these situations, the deal terms tend to be random: the angel
asks his lawyer to create a vanilla agreement, and the terms end
up being whatever the lawyer considers vanilla.  Which in practice
usually means, whatever existing agreement he finds lying around
his firm.  (Few legal documents are created from scratch.)<br><br>These heaps o&apos; boilerplate are a problem for small startups, because
they tend to grow into the union of all preceding documents.  I
know of one startup that got from an angel investor what amounted
to a five hundred pound handshake: after deciding to invest, the
angel presented them with a 70-page agreement.  The startup didn&apos;t
have enough money to pay a lawyer even to read it, let alone negotiate
the terms, so the deal fell through.<br><br>One solution to this problem would be to have the startup&apos;s lawyer
produce the agreement, instead of the angel&apos;s.  Some angels might
balk at this, but others would probably welcome it.<br><br>Inexperienced angels often get cold feet when the time comes to
write that big check.  In our startup, one of the two angels in the
initial round took months to pay us, and only did after repeated
nagging from our lawyer, who was also, fortunately, his lawyer.<br><br>It&apos;s obvious why investors delay.  Investing in startups is risky!
When a company is only two months old, every <i>day</i> you wait
gives you 1.7% more data about their trajectory.  But the investor
is already being compensated for that risk in the low price of the
stock, so it is unfair to delay.<br><br>Fair or not, investors do it if you let them.  Even VCs do it.  And
funding delays are a big distraction for founders, who ought to be
working on their company, not worrying about investors.  What&apos;s a
startup to do?  With both investors and acquirers, the only leverage
you have is competition.  If an investor knows you have other
investors lined up, he&apos;ll be a lot more eager to close-- and not
just because he&apos;ll worry about losing the deal, but because if other
investors are interested, you must be worth investing in.  It&apos;s the
same with acquisitions.  No one wants to buy you till someone else
wants to buy you, and then everyone wants to buy you.<br><br>The key to closing deals is never to stop pursuing alternatives.
When an investor says he wants to invest in you, or an acquirer
says they want to buy you, <i>don&apos;t believe it till you get the
check.</i>  Your natural tendency when an investor says yes will
be to relax and go back to writing code.  Alas, you can&apos;t; you have
to keep looking for more investors, if only to get this one to act.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Seed Funding Firms</b><br><br>Seed firms are like angels in that they invest relatively small
amounts at early stages, but like VCs in that they&apos;re companies
that do it as a business, rather than individuals making occasional
investments on the side.<br><br>Till now, nearly all seed firms have been so-called &quot;incubators,&quot;
so <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> gets called
one too, though the only thing we have in common is that we invest
in the earliest phase.<br><br>According to the National Association of Business Incubators, there
are about 800 incubators in the US.  This is an astounding number,
because I know the founders of a lot of startups, and I can&apos;t think
of one that began in an incubator.<br><br>What is an incubator?  I&apos;m not sure myself.  The defining quality
seems to be that you work in their space.  That&apos;s where the name
&quot;incubator&quot; comes from.  They seem to vary a great deal in other
respects.  At one extreme is the sort of pork-barrel project where
a town gets money from the state government to renovate a vacant
building as a &quot;high-tech incubator,&quot; as if it were merely lack of
the right sort of office space that had till now prevented the town
from becoming a 
<a href="siliconvalley.html">startup hub</a>.  
At the other extreme are places like
Idealab, which generates ideas for new startups internally and hires
people to work for them.<br><br>The classic Bubble incubators, most of which now seem to be dead,
were like VC firms except that they took a much bigger role in the
startups they funded.  In addition to working in their space, you
were supposed to use their office staff, lawyers, accountants, and
so on.<br><br>Whereas incubators tend (or tended) to exert more control than VCs,
Y Combinator exerts less.  <!-- We just supply seed money, advice, and
introductions.  We don't want any control over the startups we fund. -->
And we think it&apos;s better if startups operate out of their own
premises, however crappy, than the offices of their investors.  So
it&apos;s annoying that we keep getting called an &quot;incubator,&quot; but perhaps
inevitable, because there&apos;s only one of us so far and no word yet
for what we are.  If we have to be called something, the obvious
name would be &quot;excubator.&quot; (The name is more excusable if one
considers it as meaning that we enable people to escape cubicles.)<br><br>Because seed firms are companies rather than individual people,
reaching them is easier than reaching angels.  Just go to their web
site and send them an email.  The importance of personal introductions
varies, but is less than with angels or VCs.<br><br>The fact that seed firms are companies also means the investment
process is more standardized.  (This is generally true with angel
groups too.) Seed firms will probably have set deal terms they use
for every startup they fund.  The fact that the deal terms are
standard doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re favorable to you, but if other startups
have signed the same agreements and things went well for them, it&apos;s
a sign the terms are reasonable.<br><br>Seed firms differ from angels and VCs in that they invest exclusively
in the earliest phases&#x2014;often when the company is still just an
idea.  Angels and even VC firms occasionally do this, but they also
invest at later stages.<br><br>The problems are different in the early stages.  For example, in
the first couple months a startup may completely redefine their <a href="ideas.html">idea</a>.  So seed investors usually care less
about the idea than the people. This is true of all venture funding,
but especially so in the seed stage.<br><br>Like VCs, one of the advantages of seed firms is the advice they
offer.  But because seed firms operate in an earlier phase, they
need to offer different kinds of advice.  For example, a seed firm
should be able to give advice about how to approach VCs, which VCs
obviously don&apos;t need to do; whereas VCs should be able to give
advice about how to hire an &quot;executive team,&quot; which is not an issue
in the seed stage.<br><br>In the earliest phases, a lot of the problems are technical, so
seed firms should be able to help with technical as well as business
problems.<br><br>Seed firms and angel investors generally want to invest in the
initial phases of a startup, then hand them off to VC firms for the
next round.  Occasionally startups go from seed funding direct to
acquisition, however, and I expect this to become increasingly
common.<br><br>Google has been aggressively pursuing this route, and now <a href="http://ycombinator.com/buckman.html">Yahoo</a> is too.  Both
now compete directly with VCs.  And this is a smart move.  Why wait
for further funding rounds to jack up a startup&apos;s price?  When a
startup reaches the point where VCs have enough information to
invest in it, the acquirer should have enough information to buy
it.  More information, in fact; with their technical depth, the
acquirers should be better at picking winners than VCs.<br><br><b>Venture Capital Funds</b><br><br>VC firms are like seed firms in that they&apos;re actual companies, but
they invest other people&apos;s money, and much larger amounts of it.
VC investments average several million dollars.  So they tend to
come later in the life of a startup, are harder to get, and come
with tougher terms.<br><br>The word &quot;venture capitalist&quot; is sometimes used loosely for any
venture investor, but there is a sharp difference between VCs and
other investors: VC firms are organized as <i>funds</i>, much like
hedge funds or mutual funds.  The fund managers, who are called
&quot;general partners,&quot; get about 2% of the fund annually as a management
fee, plus about 20% of the fund&apos;s gains.<br><br>There is a very sharp dropoff in performance among VC firms, because
in the VC business both success and failure are self-perpetuating.
When an investment scores spectacularly, as Google did for Kleiner
and Sequoia, it generates a lot of good publicity for the VCs.  And
many founders prefer to take money from successful VC firms, because
of the legitimacy it confers.  Hence a vicious (for the losers)
cycle:  VC firms that have been doing badly will only get the deals
the bigger fish have rejected, causing them to continue to do badly.<br><br>As a result, of the thousand or so VC funds in the US now, only
about 50 are likely to make money, and it is very hard for a new
fund to break into this group.<br><br>In a sense, the lower-tier VC firms are a bargain for founders.
They may not be quite as smart or as well connected as the big-name
firms, but they are much hungrier for deals.  This means you should
be able to get better terms from them.<br><br>Better how?  The most obvious is valuation: they&apos;ll take less of
your company.  But as well as money, there&apos;s power.  I think founders
will increasingly be able to stay on as CEO, and on terms that will
make it fairly hard to fire them later.<br><br>The most dramatic change, I predict,
is that VCs will allow founders to 
cash out partially by <a href="vcsqueeze.html">selling</a>
some of their stock direct to the VC firm.  VCs have traditionally
resisted letting founders get anything before the ultimate &quot;liquidity
event.&quot;  But they&apos;re also desperate for deals.  And since I know
from my own experience that the rule against buying stock from
founders is a stupid one, this is a natural place for things to
give as venture funding becomes more and more a seller&apos;s market.<br><br>The disadvantage of taking money from less known firms is that
people will assume, correctly or not, that you were turned down by
the more exalted ones.  But, like where you went to college, the
name of your VC stops mattering once you have some performance to
measure.  So the more confident you are, the less you need a
brand-name VC.  We funded Viaweb entirely with angel money; it never
occurred to us that the backing of a well known VC firm would make
us seem more impressive.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another danger of less known firms is that, like angels, they have
less reputation to protect.   I suspect it&apos;s the lower-tier firms
that are responsible for most of the tricks that have given VCs
such a bad reputation among hackers.  They are doubly hosed: the
general partners themselves are less able, and yet they have harder
problems to solve, because the top VCs skim off all the best deals,
leaving the lower-tier firms exactly the startups that are likely
to blow up.<br><br>For example, lower-tier firms are much more likely to pretend to
want to do a deal with you just to lock you up while they decide
if they really want to.  One experienced CFO said:
<blockquote>
 The better ones usually will not give a term sheet unless they
 really want to do a deal. The second or third tier firms have a
 much higher break rate&#x2014;it could be as high as 50%.
</blockquote>
It&apos;s obvious why: the lower-tier firms&apos; biggest fear, when chance
throws them a bone, is that one of the big dogs will notice and
take it away.  The big dogs don&apos;t have to worry about that.<br><br>Falling victim to this trick could really hurt you.  As one
VC told me:
<blockquote>
  If you were talking to four VCs, told three of them that you
  accepted a term sheet, and then have to call them back to tell
  them you were just kidding, you are absolutely damaged goods.
</blockquote>
Here&apos;s a partial solution: when a VC offers you a term sheet, ask
how many of their last 10 term sheets turned into deals.  This will
at least force them to lie outright if they want to mislead you.<br><br>Not all the people who work at VC firms are partners.  Most firms
also have a handful of junior employees called something like
associates or analysts.  If you get a call from a VC
firm, go to their web site and check whether the person you talked
to is a partner.  Odds are it will be a junior person; they scour
the web looking for startups their bosses could invest in.  The
junior people will tend to seem very positive about your company.
They&apos;re not pretending; they <i>want</i> to believe you&apos;re a hot
prospect, because it would be a huge coup for them if their firm
invested in a company they discovered.  Don&apos;t be misled by this
optimism.  It&apos;s the partners who decide, and they view things with
a colder eye.<br><br>Because VCs invest large amounts, the money comes with more
restrictions.  Most only come into effect if the company gets into
trouble.  For example, VCs generally write it into the deal that
in any sale, they get their investment back first.  So if the company
gets sold at a low price, the founders could get nothing.  Some VCs
now require that in any sale they get 4x their investment back
before the common stock holders (that is, you) get anything, but
this is an abuse that should be resisted.<br><br>Another difference with large investments is that the founders are
usually required to accept &quot;vesting&quot;&#x2014;to surrender their stock and
earn it back over the next 4-5 years.  VCs don&apos;t want to invest
millions in a company the founders could just walk away from.
Financially, vesting has little effect, but in some situations it
could mean founders will have less power.  If VCs got de facto
control of the company and fired one of the founders, he&apos;d lose any
unvested stock unless there was specific protection against this.
So vesting would in that situation force founders to toe the line.<br><br>The most noticeable change when a startup takes serious funding is
that the founders will no longer have complete control.  Ten years
ago VCs used to insist that founders step down as CEO and hand the
job over to a business guy they supplied.  This is less the rule
now, partly because the disasters of the Bubble showed that generic
business guys don&apos;t make such great CEOs.<br><br>But while founders will increasingly be able to stay on as CEO,
they&apos;ll have to cede some power, because the board of directors
will become more powerful.  In the seed stage, the board is generally
a formality; if you want to talk to the other board members, you
just yell into the next room.  This stops with VC-scale money.  In
a typical VC funding deal, the board of directors might be composed
of two VCs, two founders, and one outside person acceptable to both.
The board will have ultimate power, which means the founders now
have to convince instead of commanding.<br><br>This is not as bad as it sounds, however.  Bill Gates is in the
same position; he doesn&apos;t have majority control of Microsoft; in
principle he also has to convince instead of commanding.  And yet
he seems pretty commanding, doesn&apos;t he?  As long as things are going
smoothly, boards don&apos;t interfere much.  The danger comes when there&apos;s
a bump in the road, as happened to Steve Jobs at Apple.<br><br>Like angels, VCs prefer to invest in deals that come to them through
people they know.  So while nearly all VC funds have some address
you can send your business plan to, VCs privately admit the chance
of getting funding by this route is near zero.  One recently told
me that he did not know a single startup that got funded this way.<br><br>I suspect VCs accept business plans &quot;over the transom&quot; more as a
way to keep tabs on industry trends than as a source of deals.  In
fact, I would strongly advise against mailing your business plan
randomly to VCs, because they treat this as evidence of laziness.
Do the extra work of getting personal introductions.  As one VC put
it:
<blockquote>
  I&apos;m not hard to find.  I know a lot of people.  If you can&apos;t find
  some way to reach me, how are you going to create a successful
  company?
</blockquote>
One of the most difficult problems for startup founders is deciding
when to approach VCs. You really only get one chance, because they
rely heavily on first impressions.  And you can&apos;t approach some and
save others for later, because (a) they ask who else you&apos;ve talked
to and when and (b) they talk among themselves.  If you&apos;re talking
to one VC and he finds out that you were rejected by another several
months ago, you&apos;ll definitely seem shopworn.<br><br>So when do you approach VCs?  When you can convince them.  If the
founders have impressive resumes and the idea isn&apos;t hard to understand,
you could approach VCs quite early.  Whereas if the founders are
unknown and the idea is very novel, you might have to launch the
thing and show that users loved it before VCs would be convinced.<br><br>If several VCs are interested in you, they will sometimes be willing
to split the deal between them.  They&apos;re more likely to do this if
they&apos;re close in the VC pecking order.  Such deals may be a net win
for founders, because you get multiple VCs interested in your
success, and you can ask each for advice about the other.  One
founder I know wrote:
<blockquote>
  Two-firm deals are great. It costs you a little more equity, but
  being able to play the two firms off each other (as well as ask
  one if the other is being out of line) is invaluable.
</blockquote>
When you do negotiate with VCs, remember that they&apos;ve done this a
lot more than you have.  They&apos;ve invested in dozens of startups,
whereas this is probably the first you&apos;ve founded.  But don&apos;t let
them or the situation intimidate you. The average founder is smarter
than the average VC.  So just do what you&apos;d do in any complex,
unfamiliar situation: proceed deliberately, and question anything
that seems odd.<br><br>It is, unfortunately, common for VCs to put terms in an agreement
whose consequences surprise founders later, and also common for VCs
to defend things they do by saying that they&apos;re standard in the
industry.  Standard, schmandard; the whole industry is only a few
decades old, and rapidly evolving.  The concept of &quot;standard&quot; is a
useful one when you&apos;re operating on a small scale (Y Combinator
uses identical terms for every deal because for tiny seed-stage
investments it&apos;s not worth the overhead of negotiating individual
deals), but it doesn&apos;t apply at the VC level.  On that scale, every
negotiation is unique.<br><br>Most successful startups get money from more than one of the preceding
five sources. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font>
And, confusingly, the names of funding sources
also tend to be used as the names of different rounds.  The best
way to explain how it all works is to follow the case of a hypothetical
startup.<br><br><b>Stage 1: Seed Round</b><br><br>Our startup begins when a group of three friends have an idea--
either an idea for something they might build, or simply the idea
&quot;let&apos;s start a company.&quot;  Presumably they already have some source
of food and shelter.  But if you have food and shelter, you probably
also have something you&apos;re supposed to be working on: either
classwork, or a job.  So if you want to work full-time on a startup,
your money situation will probably change too.<br><br>A lot of startup founders say they started the company without any
idea of what they planned to do.  This is actually less common than
it seems: many have to claim they thought of the idea after quitting
because otherwise their former employer would own it.<br><br>The three friends decide to take the leap.  Since most startups are
in competitive businesses, you not only want to work full-time on
them, but more than full-time.  So some or all of the friends quit
their jobs or leave school.  (Some of the founders in a startup can
stay in grad school, but at least one has to make the company his
full-time job.)<br><br>They&apos;re going to run the company out of one of their apartments at
first, and since they don&apos;t have any users they don&apos;t have to pay
much for infrastructure.  Their main expenses are setting up the
company, which costs a couple thousand dollars in legal work and
registration fees, and the living expenses of the founders.<br><br>The phrase &quot;seed investment&quot; covers a broad range.  To some VC firms
it means $500,000, but to most startups it means several months&apos;
living expenses.  We&apos;ll suppose our group of friends start with
$15,000 from their friend&apos;s rich uncle, who they give 5% of the
company in return.  There&apos;s only common stock at this stage.  They
leave 20% as an options pool for later employees (but they set
things up so that they can issue this stock to themselves if they
get bought early and most is still unissued), and the three founders
each get 25%.<br><br>By living really cheaply they think they can make the remaining
money last five months.  When you have five months&apos; runway left,
how soon do you need to start looking for your next round?  Answer:
immediately.  It takes time to find investors, and time (always
more than you expect) for the deal to close even after they say
yes.  So if our group of founders know what they&apos;re doing they&apos;ll
start sniffing around for angel investors right away.  But of course
their main job is to build version 1 of their software.<br><br>The friends might have liked to have more money in this first phase,
but being slightly underfunded teaches them an important lesson.
For a startup, cheapness is power.  The lower your costs, the more
options you have&#x2014;not just at this stage, but at every point till
you&apos;re profitable.  When you have a high &quot;burn rate,&quot; you&apos;re always
under time pressure, which means (a) you don&apos;t have time for your
ideas to evolve, and (b) you&apos;re often forced to take deals you don&apos;t
like.<br><br>Every startup&apos;s rule should be: spend little, and work fast.<br><br>After ten weeks&apos; work the three friends have built a prototype that
gives one a taste of what their product will do.  It&apos;s not what
they originally set out to do&#x2014;in the process of writing it, they
had some new ideas.  And it only does a fraction of what the finished
product will do, but that fraction includes stuff that no one else
has done before.<br><br>They&apos;ve also written at least a skeleton business plan, addressing
the five fundamental questions: what they&apos;re going to do, why users
need it, how large the market is, how they&apos;ll make money, and who
the competitors are and why this company is going to beat them.
(That last has to be more specific than &quot;they suck&quot; or &quot;we&apos;ll work
really hard.&quot;)<br><br>If you have to choose between spending time on the demo or the
business plan, spend most on the demo.   Software is not only more
convincing, but a better way to explore ideas.<br><br><b>Stage 2: Angel Round</b><br><br>While writing the prototype, the group has been traversing their
network of friends in search of angel investors.  They find some
just as the prototype is demoable.  When they demo it, one of the
angels is willing to invest.  Now the group is looking for more
money: they want enough to last for a year, and maybe to hire a
couple friends.  So they&apos;re going to raise $200,000.<br><br>The angel agrees to invest at a pre-money valuation of $1 million.
The company issues $200,000 worth of new shares to the angel; if
there were 1000 shares before the deal, this means 200 additional
shares.  The angel now owns 200/1200 shares, or a sixth of the
company, and all the previous shareholders&apos; percentage ownership
is diluted by a sixth.  After the deal, the capitalization table
looks like this:
<xmp>
shareholder   shares    percent
-------------------------------
angel           200       16.7
uncle            50        4.2
each founder    250       20.8
option pool     200       16.7
               ----      -----
total          1200      100
</xmp>
To keep things simple, I had the angel do a straight cash for stock
deal.  In reality the angel might be more likely to make the
investment in the form of a convertible loan.  A convertible loan
is a loan that can be converted into stock later; it works out the
same as a stock purchase in the end, but gives the angel more
protection against being squashed by VCs in future rounds.<br><br>Who pays the legal bills for this deal?  The startup, remember,
only has a couple thousand left.  In practice this turns out to be
a sticky problem that usually gets solved in some improvised way.
Maybe the startup can find lawyers who will do it cheaply in the
hope of future work if the startup succeeds.  Maybe someone has a
lawyer friend.  Maybe the angel pays for his lawyer to represent
both sides.  (Make sure if you take the latter route that the lawyer
is <i>representing</i> you rather than merely advising you, or his
only duty is to the investor.)<br><br>An angel investing $200k would probably expect a seat on the board
of directors.  He might also want preferred stock, meaning a special
class of stock that has some additional rights over the common stock
everyone else has.  Typically these rights include vetoes over major
strategic decisions, protection against being diluted in future
rounds, and the right to get one&apos;s investment back first if the
company is sold.<br><br>Some investors might expect the founders to accept vesting for a
sum this size, and others wouldn&apos;t.  VCs are more likely to require
vesting than angels.  At Viaweb we managed to raise $2.5 million
from angels without ever accepting vesting, largely because we were
so inexperienced that we were appalled at the idea.  In practice
this turned out to be good, because it made us harder to push around.<br><br>Our experience was unusual; vesting is the norm for amounts that
size.  Y Combinator doesn&apos;t require vesting, because (a) we invest
such small amounts, and (b) we think it&apos;s unnecessary, and that the
hope of getting rich is enough motivation to keep founders at work.
But maybe if we were investing millions we would think differently.<br><br>I should add that vesting is also a way for founders to protect
themselves against one another.  It solves the problem of what to
do if one of the founders quits.  So some founders impose it on
themselves when they start the company.<br><br>The angel deal takes two weeks to close, so we are now three months
into the life of the company.<br><br>The point after you get the first big chunk of angel money will
usually be the happiest phase in a startup&apos;s life.  It&apos;s a lot like
being a postdoc: you have no immediate financial worries, and few
responsibilities.  You get to work on juicy kinds of work, like
designing software.  You don&apos;t have to spend time on bureaucratic
stuff, because you haven&apos;t hired any bureaucrats yet.  Enjoy it
while it lasts, and get as much done as you can, because you will
never again be so productive.<br><br>With an apparently inexhaustible sum of money sitting safely in the
bank, the founders happily set to work turning their prototype into
something they can release.  They hire one of their friends&#x2014;at
first just as a consultant, so they can try him out&#x2014;and then a
month later as employee #1. They pay him the smallest salary he can
live on, plus 3% of the company in restricted stock, vesting over
four years.  (So after this the option pool is down to 13.7%).  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font>
They also spend a little money on a freelance graphic designer.<br><br>How much stock do you give early employees?  That varies so much
that there&apos;s no conventional number.  If you get someone really
good, really early, it might be wise to give him as much stock as
the founders.  The one universal rule is that the amount of stock
an employee gets decreases polynomially with the age of the company.
In other words, you get rich as a power of how early you were.  So
if some friends want you to come work for their startup, don&apos;t wait
several months before deciding.<br><br>A month later, at the end of month four, our group of founders have
something they can launch.  Gradually through word of mouth they
start to get users.  Seeing the system in use by real users&#x2014;people
they don&apos;t know&#x2014;gives them lots of new ideas.  Also they find
they now worry obsessively about the status of their server.  (How
relaxing founders&apos; lives must have been when startups wrote VisiCalc.)<br><br>By the end of month six, the system is starting to have a solid
core of features, and a small but devoted following.  People start
to write about it, and the founders are starting to feel like experts
in their field.<br><br>We&apos;ll assume that their startup is one that could put millions more
to use.  Perhaps they need to spend a lot on marketing, or build
some kind of expensive infrastructure, or hire highly paid salesmen.
So they decide to start talking to VCs.  They get introductions to
VCs from various sources: their angel investor connects them with
a couple; they meet a few at conferences; a couple VCs call them
after reading about them.<br><br><b>Step 3: Series A Round</b><br><br>Armed with their now somewhat fleshed-out business plan and able
to demo a real, working system, the founders visit the VCs they
have introductions to.  They find the VCs intimidating and inscrutable.
They all ask the same question: who else have you pitched to?  (VCs
are like high school girls: they&apos;re acutely aware of their position
in the VC pecking order, and their interest in a company is a
function of the interest other VCs show in it.)<br><br>One of the VC firms says they want to invest and offers the founders
a term sheet.  A term sheet is a summary of what the deal terms
will be when and if they do a deal; lawyers will fill in the details
later.  By accepting the term sheet, the startup agrees to turn
away other VCs for some set amount of time while this firm does the
&quot;due diligence&quot; required for the deal.  Due diligence is the corporate
equivalent of a background check: the purpose is to uncover any
hidden bombs that might sink the company later, like serious design
flaws in the product, pending lawsuits against the company,
intellectual property issues, and so on.  VCs&apos; legal and financial
due diligence is pretty thorough, but the technical due diligence
is generally a joke.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>The due diligence discloses no ticking bombs, and six weeks later
they go ahead with the deal.  Here are the terms: a $2 million
investment at a pre-money valuation of $4 million, meaning that
after the deal closes the VCs will own a third of the company (2 /
(4 + 2)).  The VCs also insist that prior to the deal the option
pool be enlarged by an additional hundred shares.  So the total
number of new shares issued is 750, and the cap table becomes:
<xmp>
shareholder   shares    percent
-------------------------------
VCs             650       33.3
angel           200       10.3
uncle            50        2.6
each founder    250       12.8
employee         36*       1.8     *unvested
option pool     264       13.5
               ----      -----
total          1950      100
</xmp>
This picture is unrealistic in several respects.  For example, while
the percentages might end up looking like this, it&apos;s unlikely that
the VCs would keep the existing numbers of shares.  In fact, every
bit of the startup&apos;s paperwork would probably be replaced, as if
the company were being founded anew.  Also, the money might come
in several tranches, the later ones subject to various 
conditions&#x2014;though this is apparently more common in deals with lower-tier VCs
(whose lot in life is to fund more dubious startups) than with the
top firms.<br><br>And of course any VCs reading this are probably rolling on the floor
laughing at how my hypothetical VCs let the angel keep his 10.3 of
the company.  I admit, this is the Bambi version; in simplifying
the picture, I&apos;ve also made everyone nicer.  In the real world, VCs
regard angels the way a jealous husband feels about his wife&apos;s
previous boyfriends.  To them the company didn&apos;t exist before they
invested in it.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>I don&apos;t want to give the impression you have to do an angel round
before going to VCs.  In this example I stretched things out to
show multiple sources of funding in action. Some startups could go
directly from seed funding to a VC round; several of the companies
we&apos;ve funded have.<br><br>The founders are required to vest their shares over four years, and
the board is now reconstituted to consist of two VCs, two founders,
and a fifth person acceptable to both. The angel investor cheerfully
surrenders his board seat.<br><br>At this point there is nothing new our startup can teach us about
funding&#x2014;or at least, nothing good.   
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#777777">10</font></a>]</font>
The startup will almost
certainly hire more people at this point; those millions must be
put to work, after all.  The company may do additional funding
rounds, presumably at higher valuations.  They may if they are
extraordinarily fortunate do an IPO, which we should remember is
also in principle a round of funding, regardless of its de facto
purpose.  But that, if not beyond the bounds of possibility, is
beyond the scope of this article.<br><br><b>Deals Fall Through</b><br><br>Anyone who&apos;s been through a startup will find the preceding portrait
to be missing something: disasters.  If there&apos;s one thing all
startups have in common, it&apos;s that something is always going wrong.
And nowhere more than in matters of funding.<br><br>For example, our hypothetical startup never spent more than half
of one round before securing the next.  That&apos;s more ideal than
typical.  Many startups&#x2014;even successful ones&#x2014;come close to
running out of money at some point.  Terrible things happen to
startups when they run out of money, because they&apos;re designed for
growth, not adversity.<br><br>But the most unrealistic thing about the series of deals I&apos;ve
described is that they all closed.  In the startup world, closing
is not what deals do.  What deals do is fall through.  If you&apos;re
starting a startup you would do well to remember that.  Birds fly;
fish swim; deals fall through.<br><br>Why?  Partly the reason deals seem to fall through so often is that
you lie to yourself.  You want the deal to close, so you start to
believe it will.  But even correcting for this, startup deals fall
through alarmingly often&#x2014;far more often than, say, deals to buy
real estate.  The reason is that it&apos;s such a risky environment.
People about to fund or acquire a startup are prone to wicked cases
of buyer&apos;s remorse.  They don&apos;t really grasp the risk they&apos;re taking
till the deal&apos;s about to close.  And then they panic.  And not just
inexperienced angel investors, but big companies too.<br><br>So if you&apos;re a startup founder wondering why some angel investor
isn&apos;t returning your phone calls, you can at least take comfort in
the thought that the same thing is happening to other deals a hundred
times the size.<br><br>The example of a startup&apos;s history that I&apos;ve presented is like a
skeleton&#x2014;accurate so far as it goes, but needing to be fleshed
out to be a complete picture.  To get a complete picture, just add
in every possible disaster.<br><br>A frightening prospect?  In a way.  And yet also in a way encouraging.
The very uncertainty of startups frightens away almost everyone.
People overvalue stability&#x2014;especially <a href="hiring.html">young</a>
people, who ironically need it least.  And so in starting a startup,
as in any really bold undertaking, merely deciding to do it gets
you halfway there.  On the day of the race, most of the other runners
won&apos;t show up.<br><br><br><br><xa href="http://reddit.com/vote?url=http://www.paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html"><ximg src="http://reddit.com/static/voteme.png" border="0" height="42" width="32">

The aim of such regulations is to protect widows and orphans
from crooked investment schemes; people with a million dollars in
liquid assets are assumed to be able to protect themselves.
The unintended consequence is that the investments that generate
the highest returns, like hedge funds, are available only to the
rich.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Consulting is where product companies go to die.  IBM is the
most famous example.  So starting as a consulting company is like
starting out in the grave and trying to work your way up into the
world of the living.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
If &quot;near you&quot; doesn&apos;t mean the Bay Area, Boston, or Seattle,
consider moving.  It&apos;s not a coincidence you haven&apos;t heard of many
startups from Philadelphia.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Investors are often compared to sheep.  And they are like sheep,
but that&apos;s a rational response to their situation.  Sheep act the
way they do for a reason.  If all the other sheep head for a certain
field, it&apos;s probably good grazing.  And when a wolf appears, is he
going to eat a sheep in the middle of the flock, or one near the
edge?<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
This was partly confidence, and partly simple ignorance.  We
didn&apos;t know ourselves which VC firms were the impressive ones.  We
thought software was all that mattered.  But that turned out to be
the right direction to be naive in: it&apos;s much better to overestimate
than underestimate the importance of making a good product.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
I&apos;ve omitted one source: government grants.  I don&apos;t think
these are even worth thinking about for the average startup.
Governments may mean well when they set up grant programs to encourage
startups, but what they give with one hand they take away with the
other: the process of applying is inevitably so arduous, and the
restrictions on what you can do with the money so burdensome, that
it would be easier to take a job to get the money.<br><br><!-- Here's an excerpt from an email I got from a German startup
founder:
<blockquote>
I recently got 50k EUR government funding for technological innovation (basically to buy software, computers and so on). I can't hire people 
on that money (except pay myself absolute minimum wage) and the money 
is spread over 18 months and arrives with a delay of 6 months. I can't 
spend money on my accountant, or any non-technology costs (can't buy 
chairs either). To solve my money problems and try to set my mind at 
ease, I have been thinking to do consultancy work for other people.
</blockquote> -->
You should be especially suspicious of grants whose purpose is some
kind of social engineering-- e.g. to encourage more startups to be
started in Mississippi.  Free money to start a startup in a place
where few succeed is hardly free.<br><br>Some government agencies run venture funding groups, which make
investments rather than giving grants.  For example, the CIA runs
a venture fund called In-Q-Tel that is modelled on private sector
funds and apparently generates good returns.  They would probably
be worth approaching&#x2014;if you don&apos;t mind taking money from the CIA.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Options have largely been replaced with restricted stock, which
amounts to the same thing.  Instead of earning the right to buy
stock, the employee gets the stock up front, and earns the right
not to have to give it back.  The shares set aside for this purpose
are still called the &quot;option pool.&quot;<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
First-rate technical people do not generally hire themselves
out to do due diligence for VCs.  So the most difficult
part for startup founders is often responding politely to the inane
questions of the &quot;expert&quot; they send to look you over.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
VCs regularly wipe out angels by issuing arbitrary amounts of
new stock.  They seem to have a standard piece of casuistry for
this situation: that the angels are no longer working to help the
company, and so don&apos;t deserve to keep their stock.  This of course
reflects a willful misunderstanding of what investment means; like
any investor, the angel is being compensated for risks he took
earlier.  By a similar logic, one could argue that the VCs should
be deprived of their shares when the company goes public.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
One new thing the company might encounter is a <i>down
round</i>, or a funding round at valuation lower than the previous
round.  Down rounds are bad news; it is generally the common stock
holders who take the hit.  Some of the most fearsome provisions in
VC deal terms have to do with down rounds&#x2014;like &quot;full ratchet
anti-dilution,&quot; which is as frightening as it sounds.<br><br>Founders are tempted to ignore these clauses, because they think
the company will either be a big success or a complete bust.  VCs
know otherwise: it&apos;s not uncommon for startups to have moments of
adversity before they ultimately succeed.  So it&apos;s worth negotiating
anti-dilution provisions, even though you don&apos;t think you need to,
and VCs will try to make you feel that you&apos;re being gratuitously
troublesome.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Hutch Fishman, Steve Huffman, Jessica

<p>
November 2005<br><br>Does &quot;Web 2.0&quot; mean anything?  Till recently I thought it didn&apos;t,
but the truth turns out to be more complicated.  Originally, yes,
it was meaningless.  Now it seems to have acquired a meaning.  And
yet those who dislike the term are probably right, because if it
means what I think it does, we don&apos;t need it.<br><br>I first heard the phrase &quot;Web 2.0&quot; in the name of the Web 2.0
conference in 2004.  At the time it was supposed to mean using &quot;the
web as a platform,&quot; which I took to refer to web-based applications.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>So I was surprised at a conference this summer when Tim O&apos;Reilly
led a session intended to figure out a definition of &quot;Web 2.0.&quot;
Didn&apos;t it already mean using the web as a platform?  And if it
didn&apos;t already mean something, why did we need the phrase at all?<br><br><b>Origins</b><br><br>Tim says the phrase &quot;Web 2.0&quot; first
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20
.html">arose</a> in &quot;a brainstorming session between
O&apos;Reilly and Medialive International.&quot; What is Medialive International?
&quot;Producers of technology tradeshows and conferences,&quot; according to
their site.  So presumably that&apos;s what this brainstorming session
was about.  O&apos;Reilly wanted to organize a conference about the web,
and they were wondering what to call it.<br><br>I don&apos;t think there was any deliberate plan to suggest there was a
new <i>version</i> of the web.  They just wanted to make the point
that the web mattered again.  It was a kind of semantic deficit
spending: they knew new things were coming, and the &quot;2.0&quot; referred
to whatever those might turn out to be.<br><br>And they were right.  New things were coming.  But the new version
number led to some awkwardness in the short term.  In the process
of developing the pitch for the first conference, someone must have
decided they&apos;d better take a stab at explaining what that &quot;2.0&quot;
referred to.  Whatever it meant, &quot;the web as a platform&quot; was at
least not too constricting.<br><br>The story about &quot;Web 2.0&quot; meaning the web as a platform didn&apos;t live
much past the first conference.  By the second conference, what
&quot;Web 2.0&quot; seemed to mean was something about democracy.  At least,
it did when people wrote about it online.  The conference itself
didn&apos;t seem very grassroots.  It cost $2800, so the only people who
could afford to go were VCs and people from big companies.<br><br>And yet, oddly enough, Ryan Singel&apos;s <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,69114,00.html">article</a>
about the conference in <i>Wired News</i> spoke of &quot;throngs of
geeks.&quot;  When a friend of mine asked Ryan about this, it was news
to him.  He said he&apos;d originally written something like &quot;throngs
of VCs and biz dev guys&quot; but had later shortened it just to &quot;throngs,&quot;
and that this must have in turn been expanded by the editors into
&quot;throngs of geeks.&quot;  After all, a Web 2.0 conference would presumably
be full of geeks, right?<br><br>Well, no.  There were about 7.  Even Tim O&apos;Reilly was wearing a   
suit, a sight so alien I couldn&apos;t parse it at first.  I saw
him walk by and said to one of the O&apos;Reilly people &quot;that guy looks
just like Tim.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, that&apos;s Tim.  He bought a suit.&quot;
I ran after him, and sure enough, it was.  He explained that he&apos;d
just bought it in Thailand.<br><br>The 2005 Web 2.0 conference reminded me of Internet trade shows
during the Bubble, full of prowling VCs looking for the next hot
startup.  There was that same odd atmosphere created by a large  
number of people determined not to miss out.  Miss out on what?
They didn&apos;t know.  Whatever was going to happen&#x2014;whatever Web 2.0
turned out to be.<br><br>I wouldn&apos;t quite call it &quot;Bubble 2.0&quot; just because VCs are eager
to invest again.  The Internet is a genuinely big deal.  The bust
was as much an <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/bubble.html">overreaction</a> as
the boom.  It&apos;s to be expected that once we started to pull out of
the bust, there would be a lot of growth in this area, just as there
was in the industries that spiked the sharpest before the Depression.<br><br>The reason this won&apos;t turn into a second Bubble is that the IPO
market is gone.  <a href="startupfunding.html">Venture investors</a>
are driven by exit strategies.  The reason they were funding all  
those laughable startups during the late 90s was that they hoped
to sell them to gullible retail investors; they hoped to be laughing
all the way to the bank.  Now that route is closed.  Now the default
exit strategy is to get bought, and acquirers are less prone to
irrational exuberance than IPO investors.  The closest you&apos;ll get 
to Bubble valuations is Rupert Murdoch paying $580 million for   
Myspace.  That&apos;s only off by a factor of 10 or so.<br><br><b>1. Ajax</b><br><br>Does &quot;Web 2.0&quot; mean anything more than the name of a conference
yet?  I don&apos;t like to admit it, but it&apos;s starting to.  When people
say &quot;Web 2.0&quot; now, I have some idea what they mean.  And the fact
that I both despise the phrase and understand it is the surest proof
that it has started to mean something.<br><br>One ingredient of its meaning is certainly Ajax, which I can still
only just bear to use without scare quotes.  Basically, what &quot;Ajax&quot;
means is &quot;Javascript now works.&quot;  And that in turn means that
web-based applications can now be made to work much more like desktop
ones.<br><br>As you read this, a whole new <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB113098635587487074.html?mod=todays_
free_feature">generation</a>
of software is being written to take advantage of Ajax.  There
hasn&apos;t been such a wave of new applications since microcomputers
first appeared.  Even Microsoft sees it, but it&apos;s too late for them
to do anything more than <a href="http://www.hypercamp.org/2005/11/09">leak</a> &quot;internal&quot;  
documents designed to give the impression they&apos;re on top of this
new trend.<br><br>In fact the new generation of software is being written way too
fast for Microsoft even to channel it, let alone write their own
in house.  Their only hope now is to buy all the best Ajax startups
before Google does.  And even that&apos;s going to be hard, because
Google has as big a head start in buying microstartups as it did
in search a few years ago.  After all, Google Maps, the canonical
Ajax application, was the result of a startup they <a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2005/10/google-maps-lead-engineer-gaze
s-into.html">bought</a>.<br><br>So ironically the original description of the Web 2.0 conference
turned out to be partially right: web-based applications are a big
component of Web 2.0.  But I&apos;m convinced they got this right by 
accident.  The Ajax boom didn&apos;t start till early 2005, when Google
Maps appeared and the term &quot;Ajax&quot; was <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">coined</a>.<br><br><b>2. Democracy</b><br><br>The second big element of Web 2.0 is democracy.  We now have several
examples to prove that <a href="opensource.html">amateurs</a> can   
surpass professionals, when they have the right kind of system to 
channel their efforts.  <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>
may be the most famous.  Experts have given Wikipedia middling
reviews, but they miss the critical point: it&apos;s good enough.  And   
it&apos;s free, which means people actually read it.  On the web, articles
you have to pay for might as well not exist.  Even if you were    
willing to pay to read them yourself, you can&apos;t link to them.    
They&apos;re not part of the conversation.<br><br>Another place democracy seems to win is in deciding what counts as
news.  I never look at any news site now except <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>
 I know if something major
happens, or someone writes a particularly interesting article, it   
will show up there.  Why bother checking the front page of any
specific paper or magazine?  Reddit&apos;s like an RSS feed for the whole
web, with a filter for quality.  Similar sites include <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a>, a technology news site that&apos;s
rapidly approaching Slashdot in popularity, and <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, the collaborative
bookmarking network that set off the &quot;tagging&quot; movement.  And whereas
Wikipedia&apos;s main appeal is that it&apos;s good enough and free, these
sites suggest that voters do a significantly better job than human
editors.<br><br>The most dramatic example of Web 2.0 democracy is not in the selection
of ideas, but their production.  <!-- Usage has not yet evolved to reflect
this: the only phrases we have to describe the phenomenon are ones 
that implicitly assume the superiority of the old order, like
"user-generated content," or "blogging" (neutral in itself, but 
revealingly condescending in its over-broad use).
-->
I&apos;ve noticed for a while that the stuff I read on individual people&apos;s
sites is as good as or better than the stuff I read in newspapers
and magazines.  And now I have independent evidence: the top links
on Reddit are generally links to individual people&apos;s sites rather  
than to magazine articles or news stories.<br><br>My experience of writing
for magazines suggests an explanation.  Editors.  They control the
topics you can write about, and they can generally rewrite whatever
you produce.  The result is to damp extremes.  Editing yields 95th
percentile writing&#x2014;95% of articles are improved by it, but 5% are
dragged down.  5% of the time you get &quot;throngs of geeks.&quot;<br><br>On the web, people can publish whatever they want.  Nearly all of
it falls short of the editor-damped writing in print publications.
But the pool of writers is very, very large.  If it&apos;s large enough,
the lack of damping means the best writing online should surpass  
the best in print.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>  
And now that the web has evolved mechanisms
for selecting good stuff, the web wins net.  Selection beats damping,
for the same reason market economies beat centrally planned ones.<br><br>Even the startups are different this time around.  They are to the  
startups of the Bubble what bloggers are to the print media.  During
the Bubble, a startup meant a company headed by an MBA that was   
blowing through several million dollars of VC money to &quot;get big
fast&quot; in the most literal sense.  Now it means a smaller, <a href="hiring.html">younger</a>, more technical group that just      
decided to make something great.  They&apos;ll decide later if they want  
to raise VC-scale funding, and if they take it, they&apos;ll take it on
<a href="vcsqueeze.html">their terms</a>.<br><br><b>3. Don&apos;t Maltreat Users</b><br><br>I think everyone would agree that democracy and Ajax are elements
of &quot;Web 2.0.&quot;  I also see a third: not to maltreat users.  During
the Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high-handed with users.
And not just in obvious ways, like making them register, or subjecting
them to annoying ads.  The very design of the average site in the   
late 90s was an abuse.  Many of the most popular sites were loaded
with obtrusive branding that made them slow to load and sent the
user the message: this is our site, not yours.  (There&apos;s a physical
analog in the Intel and Microsoft <a href="designedforwindows.html">stickers</a> that come on some
laptops.)<br><br>I think the root of the problem was that sites felt they were giving
something away for free, and till recently a company giving anything
away for free could be pretty high-handed about it.  Sometimes it
reached the point of economic sadism: site owners assumed that the
more pain they caused the user, the more benefit it must be to them.  
The most dramatic remnant of this model may be at salon.com, where   
you can read the beginning of a story, but to get the rest you have
sit through a <i>movie</i>.<br><br>At Y Combinator we advise all the startups we fund never to lord
it over users.  Never make users register, unless you need to in
order to store something for them.  If you do make users register,   
never make them wait for a confirmation link in an email; in fact,
don&apos;t even ask for their email address unless you need it for some
reason.  Don&apos;t ask them any unnecessary questions.  Never send them
email unless they explicitly ask for it.  Never frame pages you
link to, or open them in new windows.  If you have a free version 
and a pay version, don&apos;t make the free version too restricted.  And
if you find yourself asking &quot;should we allow users to do x?&quot; just 
answer &quot;yes&quot; whenever you&apos;re unsure.  Err on the side of generosity.<br><br>In <a href="start.html">How to Start a Startup</a> I advised startups
never to let anyone fly under them, meaning never to let any other
company offer a cheaper, easier solution.  Another way to fly low 
is to give users more power.  Let users do what they want.  If you 
don&apos;t and a competitor does, you&apos;re in trouble.<br><br>iTunes is Web 2.0ish in this sense.  Finally you can buy individual
songs instead of having to buy whole albums.  The recording industry
hated the idea and resisted it as long as possible.  But it was
obvious what users wanted, so Apple flew under the labels.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
Though really it might be better to describe iTunes as Web 1.5.     
Web 2.0 applied to music would probably mean individual bands giving
away DRMless songs for free.<br><br>The ultimate way to be nice to users is to give them something for
free that competitors charge for.  During the 90s a lot of people   
probably thought we&apos;d have some working system for micropayments     
by now.  In fact things have gone in the other direction.  The most   
successful sites are the ones that figure out new ways to give stuff
away for free.  Craigslist has largely destroyed the classified ad
sites of the 90s, and OkCupid looks likely to do the same to the
previous generation of dating sites.<br><br>Serving web pages is very, very cheap.  If you can make even a   
fraction of a cent per page view, you can make a profit.  And
technology for targeting ads continues to improve.  I wouldn&apos;t be
surprised if ten years from now eBay had been supplanted by an      
ad-supported freeBay (or, more likely, gBay).<br><br>Odd as it might sound, we tell startups that they should try to
make as little money as possible.  If you can figure out a way to
turn a billion dollar industry into a fifty million dollar industry,
so much the better, if all fifty million go to you.  Though indeed,
making things cheaper often turns out to generate more money in the
end, just as automating things often turns out to generate more
jobs.<br><br>The ultimate target is Microsoft.  What a bang that balloon is going
to make when someone pops it by offering a free web-based alternative 
to MS Office.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font>
Who will?  Google?  They seem to be taking their
time.  I suspect the pin will be wielded by a couple of 20 year old
hackers who are too naive to be intimidated by the idea.  (How hard
can it be?)<br><br><b>The Common Thread</b><br><br>Ajax, democracy, and not dissing users.  What do they all have in  
common?  I didn&apos;t realize they had anything in common till recently,
which is one of the reasons I disliked the term &quot;Web 2.0&quot; so much.
It seemed that it was being used as a label for whatever happened
to be new&#x2014;that it didn&apos;t predict anything.<br><br>But there is a common thread.  Web 2.0 means using the web the way
it&apos;s meant to be used.  The &quot;trends&quot; we&apos;re seeing now are simply
the inherent nature of the web emerging from under the broken models
that got imposed on it during the Bubble.<br><br>I realized this when I read an <!-- as-yet unpublished--> interview with
Joe Kraus, the co-founder of Excite.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font>
<blockquote>
  Excite really never got the business model right at all.  We fell 
  into the classic problem of how when a new medium comes out it
  adopts the practices, the content, the business models of the old
  medium&#x2014;which fails, and then the more appropriate models get
  figured out.
</blockquote>
It may have seemed as if not much was happening during the years
after the Bubble burst.  But in retrospect, something was happening:
the web was finding its natural angle of repose.  The democracy 
component, for example&#x2014;that&apos;s not an innovation, in the sense of
something someone made happen.  That&apos;s what the web naturally tends
to produce.<br><br>Ditto for the idea of delivering desktop-like applications over the
web.  That idea is almost as old as the web.  But the first time    
around it was co-opted by Sun, and we got Java applets.  Java has
since been remade into a generic replacement for C++, but in 1996
the story about Java was that it represented a new model of software.
Instead of desktop applications, you&apos;d run Java &quot;applets&quot; delivered
from a server.<br><br>This plan collapsed under its own weight. Microsoft helped kill it,
but it would have died anyway.  There was no uptake among hackers.
When you find <a href="submarine.html">PR firms</a> promoting
something as the next development platform, you can be sure it&apos;s
not.  If it were, you wouldn&apos;t need PR firms to tell you, because   
hackers would already be writing stuff on top of it, the way sites    
like <a href="http://busmonster.com">Busmonster</a> used Google Maps as a
platform before Google even meant it to be one.<br><br>The proof that Ajax is the next hot platform is that thousands of  
hackers have spontaneously started building things on top
of it.  Mikey likes it.<br><br>There&apos;s another thing all three components of Web 2.0 have in common.
Here&apos;s a clue.  Suppose you approached investors with the following
idea for a Web 2.0 startup:
<blockquote>
  Sites like del.icio.us and flickr allow users to &quot;tag&quot; content
  with descriptive tokens.  But there is also huge source of
  <i>implicit</i> tags that they ignore: the text within web links.
  Moreover, these links represent a social network connecting the   
  individuals and organizations who created the pages, and by using
  graph theory we can compute from this network an estimate of the

How long do you think it would take them on average to realize that
it was a description of Google?<br><br>Google was a pioneer in all three components of Web 2.0: their core
business sounds crushingly hip when described in Web 2.0 terms, 
&quot;Don&apos;t maltreat users&quot; is a subset of &quot;Don&apos;t be evil,&quot; and of course
Google set off the whole Ajax boom with Google Maps.<br><br>Web 2.0 means using the web as it was meant to be used, and Google
does.  That&apos;s their secret.  <!-- The web naturally has a certain grain,
and Google is aligned with it.  That's why their success seems so   
effortless.-->  They&apos;re sailing with the wind, instead of sitting  
becalmed praying for a business model, like the print media, or   
trying to tack upwind by suing their customers, like Microsoft and 
the record labels.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Google doesn&apos;t try to force things to happen their way.  They try   
to figure out what&apos;s going to happen, and arrange to be standing 
there when it does.  That&apos;s the way to approach technology&#x2014;and 
as business includes an ever larger technological component, the
right way to do business.<br><br>The fact that Google is a &quot;Web 2.0&quot; company shows that, while
meaningful, the term is also rather bogus.  It&apos;s like the word
&quot;allopathic.&quot;  It just means doing things right, and it&apos;s a bad   
sign when you have a special word for that.<br><br><br><br>

So could it be that procrastination isn&apos;t always bad?<br><br>Most people who write about procrastination write about how to cure
it.  But this is, strictly speaking, impossible.  There are an
infinite number of things you could be doing.  No matter what you
work on, you&apos;re not working on everything else.  So the question
is not how to avoid procrastination, but how to procrastinate well.<br><br>There are three variants of procrastination, depending on what you
do instead of working on something: you could work on (a) nothing,
(b) something less important, or (c) something more important.  That
last type, I&apos;d argue, is good procrastination.<br><br>That&apos;s the &quot;absent-minded professor,&quot; who forgets to shave, or eat,
or even perhaps look where he&apos;s going while he&apos;s thinking about
some interesting question.   His mind is absent from the everyday
world because it&apos;s hard at work in another.<br><br>That&apos;s the sense in which the most impressive people I know are all
procrastinators.  They&apos;re type-C procrastinators:  they put off
working on small stuff to work on big stuff.<br><br>What&apos;s &quot;small stuff?&quot;  Roughly, work that has zero chance of being
mentioned in your obituary.  It&apos;s hard to say at the time what will
turn out to be your best work (will it be your magnum opus on
Sumerian temple architecture, or the detective thriller you wrote
under a pseudonym?), but there&apos;s a whole class of tasks you can
safely rule out: shaving, doing your laundry, cleaning the house,
writing thank-you notes&#x2014;anything that might be called an errand.<br><br>Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work.<br><br>Good in a sense, at least.  The people who want you to do the errands
won&apos;t think it&apos;s good.  But you probably have to annoy them if you
want to get anything done.  The mildest seeming people, if they
want to do real work, all have a certain degree of ruthlessness
when it comes to avoiding errands.<br><br>Some errands, like replying to letters, go away if you
ignore them (perhaps taking friends with them).  Others, like mowing
the lawn, or filing tax returns, only get worse if you put them
off.  In principle it shouldn&apos;t work to put off the second kind of
errand.  You&apos;re going to have to do whatever it is eventually.  Why
not (as past-due notices are always saying) do it now?<br><br>The reason it pays to put off even those errands is that real work
needs two things errands don&apos;t: big chunks of time, and the
right mood.  If you get inspired by some project, it can be a net
win to blow off everything you were supposed to do for the next few
days to work on it.  Yes, those errands may cost you more time when
you finally get around to them.  But if you get a lot done during
those few days, you will be net more productive.<br><br>In fact, it may not be a difference in degree, but a difference in
kind.  There may be types of work that can only be done in long,
uninterrupted stretches, when inspiration hits, rather than dutifully
in scheduled little slices.  Empirically it seems to be so.  When
I think of the people I know who&apos;ve done great things, I don&apos;t
imagine them dutifully crossing items off to-do lists.  I imagine
them sneaking off to work on some new idea.<br><br>Conversely, forcing someone to perform errands synchronously is
bound to limit their productivity.  The cost of an interruption is
not just the time it takes, but that it breaks the time on either
side in half.  You probably only have to interrupt someone a couple
times a day before they&apos;re unable to work on hard problems at all.<br><br>I&apos;ve wondered a lot about why 
<a href="start.html">startups</a> are most productive at the
very beginning, when they&apos;re just a couple guys in an apartment.
The main reason may be that there&apos;s no one to interrupt them yet.
In theory it&apos;s good when the founders finally get enough money to
hire people to do some of the work for them.  But it may be better
to be overworked than interrupted.  Once you dilute a startup with
ordinary office workers&#x2014;with type-B procrastinators&#x2014;the whole
company starts to resonate at their frequency.  They&apos;re interrupt-driven,
and soon you are too.<br><br>Errands are so effective at killing great projects that a lot of
people use them for that purpose.  Someone who has decided to write
a novel, for example, will suddenly find that the house needs
cleaning. People who fail to write novels don&apos;t do it by sitting
in front of a blank page for days without writing anything.  They
do it by feeding the cat, going out to buy something they need for
their apartment, meeting a friend for coffee, checking email.  &quot;I
don&apos;t have time to work,&quot; they say.  And they don&apos;t; they&apos;ve made
sure of that.<br><br>(There&apos;s also a variant where one has no place to work.  The cure
is to visit the places where famous people worked, and see how
unsuitable they were.)<br><br>I&apos;ve used both these excuses at one time or another.  I&apos;ve learned
a lot of tricks for making myself work over the last 20 years, but
even now I don&apos;t win consistently.  Some days I get real work done.
Other days are eaten up by errands.  And I know it&apos;s usually my
fault: I <i>let</i> errands eat up the day, to avoid
facing some hard problem.<br><br>The most dangerous form of procrastination is unacknowledged type-B
procrastination, because it doesn&apos;t feel like procrastination.
You&apos;re &quot;getting things done.&quot;  Just the wrong things.<br><br>Any advice about procrastination that concentrates on crossing
things off your to-do list is not only incomplete, but positively
misleading, if it doesn&apos;t consider the possibility that the to-do
list is itself a form of type-B procrastination.  In fact, possibility
is too weak a word.  Nearly everyone&apos;s is.  Unless you&apos;re working
on the biggest things you could be working on, you&apos;re type-B
procrastinating, no matter how much you&apos;re getting done.<br><br>In his famous essay <a href="hamming.html">You and Your Research</a> 
(which I recommend to
anyone ambitious, no matter what they&apos;re working on), Richard Hamming
suggests that you ask yourself three questions:
<ol>
<li> What are the most important problems in your field?<br><br></li><li> Are you working on one of them?<br><br></li><li> Why not?
</li></ol>
Hamming was at Bell Labs when he started asking such questions.  In
principle anyone there ought to have been able to work on the most
important problems in their field.  Perhaps not everyone can make
an equally dramatic mark on the world; I don&apos;t know; but whatever
your capacities, there are projects that stretch them.  So Hamming&apos;s
exercise can be generalized to:
<blockquote>
  What&apos;s the best thing you could be working on, and why aren&apos;t
  you?
</blockquote>
Most people will shy away from this question.  I shy away from it
myself; I see it there on the page and quickly move on to the next
sentence.  Hamming used to go around actually asking people this,
and it didn&apos;t make him popular.  But it&apos;s a question anyone ambitious
should face.<br><br>The trouble is, you may end up hooking a very big fish with this
bait.  To do good work, you need to do more than find good projects.
Once you&apos;ve found them, you have to get yourself to work on them,
and that can be hard.  The bigger the problem, the harder it is to
get yourself to work on it.<br><br>Of course, the main reason people find it difficult to work on a
particular problem is that they don&apos;t 
<a href="hs.html">enjoy</a> it.  When you&apos;re young,
especially, you often find yourself working on stuff you don&apos;t
really like-- because it seems impressive, for example, or because
you&apos;ve been assigned to work on it.  Most grad students are stuck
working on big problems they don&apos;t really like, and grad school is
thus synonymous with procrastination.<br><br>But even when you like what you&apos;re working on, it&apos;s easier to get
yourself to work on small problems than big ones.  Why?  Why is it
so hard to work on big problems?  One reason is that you may not
get any reward in the forseeable future.  If you work on something
you can finish in a day or two, you can expect to have a nice feeling
of accomplishment fairly soon.  If the reward is indefinitely far
in the future, it seems less real.<br><br>Another reason people don&apos;t work on big projects is, ironically,
fear of wasting time.  What if they fail?  Then all the time they
spent on it will be wasted.  (In fact it probably won&apos;t be, because
work on hard projects almost always leads somewhere.)<br><br>But the trouble with big problems can&apos;t be just that they promise
no immediate reward and might cause you to waste a lot of time.  If
that were all, they&apos;d be no worse than going to visit your in-laws.
There&apos;s more to it than that.  Big problems are <i>terrifying</i>.
There&apos;s an almost physical pain in facing them.  It&apos;s like having
a vacuum cleaner hooked up to your imagination.   All your initial
ideas get sucked out immediately, and you don&apos;t have any more, and
yet the vacuum cleaner is still sucking.<br><br>You can&apos;t look a big problem too directly in the eye. You have to
approach it somewhat obliquely.  But you have to adjust the angle
just right: you have to be facing the big problem directly enough
that you catch some of the excitement radiating from it, but not
so much that it paralyzes you.  You can tighten the angle once you
get going, just as a sailboat can sail closer to the wind once it
gets underway.<br><br>If you want to work on big things, you seem to have to trick yourself
into doing it.  You have to work on small things that could grow
into big things, or work on successively larger things, or split
the moral load with collaborators.  It&apos;s not a sign of weakness to
depend on such tricks.  The very best work has been done this way.<br><br>When I talk to people who&apos;ve managed to make themselves work on big
things, I find that all blow off errands, and all feel guilty about
it.  I don&apos;t think they should feel guilty.  There&apos;s more to do
than anyone could.  So someone doing the best work they can is
inevitably going to leave a lot of errands undone.  It seems a
mistake to feel bad about that.<br><br>I think the way to &quot;solve&quot; the problem of procrastination is to let
delight pull you instead of making a to-do list push you.  Work on
an ambitious project you really enjoy, and sail as close to the
wind as you can, and you&apos;ll leave the right things undone.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert

<p>
January 2006<br><br>To do something well you have to like it.   That idea is not exactly
novel.  We&apos;ve got it down to four words: &quot;Do what you love.&quot;  But
it&apos;s not enough just to tell people that.  Doing what you love is
complicated.<br><br>The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids.  When I
was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition.
Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do
things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could
do what you wanted, and that was called playing.  Occasionally the
things adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing
wasn&apos;t&#x2014;for example, if you fell and hurt yourself.  But except
for these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as
not-fun.<br><br>And it did not seem to be an accident. School, it was implied, was
tedious <i>because</i> it was preparation for grownup work.<br><br>The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids.
Grownups, like some kind of cursed race, had to work.  Kids didn&apos;t,
but they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of
work meant to prepare us for the real thing.  Much as we disliked
school, the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, and
that we had it easy.<br><br>Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work
was not fun.  Which is not surprising: work wasn&apos;t fun for most of
them.  Why did we have to memorize state capitals instead of playing
dodgeball?  For the same reason they had to watch over a bunch of
kids instead of lying on a beach.  You couldn&apos;t just do what you
wanted.<br><br>I&apos;m not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want.
They may have to be made to work on certain things.  But if we make
kids work on dull stuff, it might be wise to tell them that tediousness
is not the defining quality of work, and indeed that the reason
they have to work on dull stuff now is so they can work on more
interesting stuff later.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever
I wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it.  I remember that
precisely because it seemed so anomalous.  It was like being told
to use dry water.  Whatever I thought he meant, I didn&apos;t think he
meant work could <i>literally</i> be fun&#x2014;fun like playing.  It
took me years to grasp that.<br><br><b>Jobs</b><br><br>By high school, the prospect of an actual job was on the horizon.
Adults would sometimes come to speak to us about their work, or we
would go to see them at work.  It was always understood that they
enjoyed what they did.  In retrospect I think one may have: the
private jet pilot.  But I don&apos;t think the bank manager really did.<br><br>The main reason they all acted as if they enjoyed their work was
presumably the upper-middle class convention that you&apos;re supposed
to.  It would not merely be bad for your career to say that you
despised your job, but a social faux-pas.<br><br>Why is it conventional to pretend to like what you do?  The first
sentence of this essay explains that.  If you have to like something
to do it well, then the most successful people will all like what
they do.  That&apos;s where the upper-middle class tradition comes from.
Just as houses all over America are full of 
<a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=louis%20xv%20chair">chairs</a>
that are, without
the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of chairs designed
250 years ago for French kings, conventional attitudes about work
are, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of
the attitudes of people who&apos;ve done great things.<br><br>What a recipe for alienation.  By the time they reach an age to
think about what they&apos;d like to do, most kids have been thoroughly
misled about the idea of loving one&apos;s work.  School has trained
them to regard work as an unpleasant duty.  Having a job is said
to be even more onerous than schoolwork.  And yet all the adults
claim to like what they do.  You can&apos;t blame kids for thinking &quot;I
am not like these people; I am not suited to this world.&quot;<br><br>Actually they&apos;ve been told three lies: the stuff they&apos;ve been taught
to regard as work in school is not real work; grownup work is not
(necessarily) worse than schoolwork; and many of the adults around
them are lying when they say they like what they do.<br><br>The most dangerous liars can be the kids&apos; own parents.  If you take
a boring job to give your family a high standard of living, as so
many people do, you risk infecting your kids with the idea that
work is boring. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>
Maybe it would be better for kids in this one
case if parents were not so unselfish.  A parent who set an example
of loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive
house.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>It was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally broke
free from the idea of making a living.  Then the important question
became not how to make money, but what to work on.  Ideally these
coincided, but some spectacular boundary cases (like Einstein in
the patent office) proved they weren&apos;t identical.<br><br>The definition of work was now to make some original contribution
to the world, and in the process not to starve.  But after the habit
of so many years my idea of work still included a large component
of pain.  Work still seemed to require discipline, because only
hard problems yielded grand results, and hard problems couldn&apos;t
literally be fun.   Surely one had to force oneself to work on them.<br><br>If you think something&apos;s supposed to hurt, you&apos;re less likely to
notice if you&apos;re doing it wrong.  That about sums up my experience
of graduate school.<br><br><b>Bounds</b><br><br><i>How much</i> are you supposed to like what you do?  Unless you
know that, you don&apos;t know when to stop searching. And if, like most
people, you underestimate it, you&apos;ll tend to stop searching too
early.  You&apos;ll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents,
or the desire to make money, or prestige&#x2014;or sheer inertia.<br><br>Here&apos;s an upper bound: Do what you love doesn&apos;t mean, do what you
would like to do most <i>this second</i>.  Even Einstein probably
had moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told himself
he ought to finish what he was working on first.<br><br>It used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what they
did so much that there was nothing they&apos;d rather do.  There didn&apos;t
seem to be any sort of work I liked <i>that</i> much.  If I had a
choice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b)
be teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was
there any sort of work I&apos;d prefer?  Honestly, no.<br><br>But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment,
float about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious
food, than work on hard problems.  The rule about doing what you
love assumes a certain length of time.  It doesn&apos;t mean, do what
will make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest
over some longer period, like a week or a month.<br><br>Unproductive pleasures pall eventually.  After a while you get tired
of lying on the beach.  If you want to stay happy, you have to do
something.<br><br>As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive
pleasure.  You have to like what you do enough that the concept of
&quot;spare time&quot; seems mistaken.  Which is not to say you have to spend
all your time working.  You can only work so much before you get
tired and start to screw up.  Then you want to do something else&#x2014;even something mindless.  But you don&apos;t regard this time as the
prize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn
it.<br><br>I put the lower bound there for practical reasons.  If your work
is not your favorite thing to do, you&apos;ll have terrible problems
with procrastination.  You&apos;ll have to force yourself to work,  and
when you resort to that the results are distinctly inferior.<br><br>To be happy I think you have to be doing something you not only
enjoy, but admire.  You have to be able to say, at the end, wow,
that&apos;s pretty cool.  This doesn&apos;t mean you have to make something.
If you learn how to hang glide, or to speak a foreign language
fluently, that will be enough to make you say, for a while at least,
wow, that&apos;s pretty cool.  What there has to be is a test.<br><br>So one thing that falls just short of the standard, I think, is
reading books.  Except for some books in math and the hard sciences,
there&apos;s no test of how well you&apos;ve read a book, and that&apos;s why
merely reading books doesn&apos;t quite feel like work.  You have to do
something with what you&apos;ve read to feel productive.<br><br>I think the best test is one Gino Lee taught me: to try to do things
that would make your friends say wow.  But it probably wouldn&apos;t
start to work properly till about age 22, because most people haven&apos;t
had a big enough sample to pick friends from before then.<br><br><b>Sirens</b><br><br>What you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of
anyone beyond your friends.  You shouldn&apos;t worry about prestige.
Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world.  When you can ask
the opinions of people whose judgement you respect, what does it
add to consider the opinions of people you don&apos;t even know? 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>This is easy advice to give.  It&apos;s hard to follow, especially when
you&apos;re young.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font>
Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps
even your beliefs about what you enjoy.  It causes you to work not
on what you like, but what you&apos;d like to like.<br><br>That&apos;s what leads people to try to write novels, for example.  They
like reading novels.  They notice that people who write them win
Nobel prizes.  What could be more wonderful, they think, than to
be a novelist?  But liking the idea of being a novelist is not
enough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you&apos;re
going to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate lies.<br><br>Prestige is just fossilized inspiration.  If you do anything well
enough, you&apos;ll <i>make</i> it prestigious.  Plenty of things we now
consider prestigious were anything but at first.  Jazz comes to
mind&#x2014;though almost any established art form would do.   So just
do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself.<br><br>Prestige is especially dangerous to the ambitious.  If you want to
make ambitious people waste their time on errands, the way to do
it is to bait the hook with prestige.  That&apos;s the recipe for getting
people to give talks, write forewords, serve on committees, be
department heads, and so on.  It might be a good rule simply to
avoid any prestigious task. If it didn&apos;t suck, they wouldn&apos;t have
had to make it prestigious.<br><br>Similarly, if you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is more
prestigious, you should probably choose the other.  Your opinions
about what&apos;s admirable are always going to be slightly influenced
by prestige, so if the two seem equal to you, you probably have
more genuine admiration for the less prestigious one.<br><br>The other big force leading people astray is money.  Money by itself
is not that dangerous.  When something pays well but is regarded
with contempt, like telemarketing, or prostitution, or personal
injury litigation, ambitious people aren&apos;t tempted by it.  That
kind of work ends up being done by people who are &quot;just trying to
make a living.&quot;  (Tip: avoid any field whose practitioners say
this.)  The danger is when money is combined with prestige, as in,
say, corporate law, or medicine.  A comparatively safe and prosperous
career with some automatic baseline prestige is dangerously tempting
to someone young, who hasn&apos;t thought much about what they really
like.<br><br>The test of whether people love what they do is whether they&apos;d do
it even if they weren&apos;t paid for it&#x2014;even if they had to work at
another job to make a living.  How many corporate lawyers would do
their current work if they had to do it for free, in their spare
time, and take day jobs as waiters to support themselves?<br><br>This test is especially helpful in deciding between different kinds
of academic work, because fields vary greatly in this respect.  Most
good mathematicians would work on math even if there were no jobs
as math professors, whereas in the departments at the other end of
the spectrum, the availability of teaching jobs is the driver:
people would rather be English professors than work in ad agencies,
and publishing papers is the way you compete for such jobs.  Math
would happen without math departments, but it is the existence of
English majors, and therefore jobs teaching them, that calls into
being all those thousands of dreary papers about gender and identity
in the novels of Conrad.  No one does 
<a href="http://www.google.com/scholar?q=gender+identity+narrative+discourse+transcend">that</a> 
kind of thing for fun.<br><br>The advice of parents will tend to err on the side of money.  It
seems safe to say there are more undergrads who want to be novelists
and whose parents want them to be doctors than who want to be doctors
and whose parents want them to be novelists.  The kids think their
parents are &quot;materialistic.&quot; Not necessarily.  All parents tend to
be more conservative for their kids than they would for themselves,
simply because, as parents, they share risks more than rewards.  If
your eight year old son decides to climb a tall tree, or your teenage
daughter decides to date the local bad boy, you won&apos;t get a share
in the excitement, but if your son falls, or your daughter gets
pregnant, you&apos;ll have to deal with the consequences.<br><br><b>Discipline</b><br><br>With such powerful forces leading us astray, it&apos;s not surprising
we find it so hard to discover what we like to work on.  Most people
are doomed in childhood by accepting the axiom that work = pain.
Those who escape this are nearly all lured onto the rocks by prestige
or money.  How many even discover something they love to work on?
A few hundred thousand, perhaps, out of billions.<br><br>It&apos;s hard to find work you love; it must be, if so few do.  So don&apos;t
underestimate this task.  And don&apos;t feel bad if you haven&apos;t succeeded
yet.  In fact, if you admit to yourself that you&apos;re discontented,
you&apos;re a step ahead of most people, who are still in denial.  If
you&apos;re surrounded by colleagues who claim to enjoy work that you
find contemptible, odds are they&apos;re lying to themselves.  Not
necessarily, but probably.<br><br>Although doing great work takes less discipline than people think&#x2014;because the way to do great work is to find something you like so
much that you don&apos;t have to force yourself to do it&#x2014;<i>finding</i>
work you love does usually require discipline.   Some people are
lucky enough to know what they want to do when they&apos;re 12, and just
glide along as if they were on railroad tracks.  But this seems the
exception.  More often people who do great things have careers with
the trajectory of a ping-pong ball.  They go to school to study A,
drop out and get a job doing B, and then become famous for C after
taking it up on the side.<br><br>Sometimes jumping from one sort of work to another is a sign of
energy, and sometimes it&apos;s a sign of laziness.  Are you dropping
out, or boldly carving a new path?  You often can&apos;t tell yourself.
Plenty of people who will later do great things seem to be disappointments
early on, when they&apos;re trying to find their niche.<br><br>Is there some test you can use to keep yourself honest?  One is to
try to do a good job at whatever you&apos;re doing, even if you don&apos;t
like it.  Then at least you&apos;ll know you&apos;re not using dissatisfaction
as an excuse for being lazy.  Perhaps more importantly, you&apos;ll get
into the habit of doing things well.<br><br>Another test you can use is: always produce.  For example, if you
have a day job you don&apos;t take seriously because you plan to be a
novelist, are you producing?  Are you writing pages of fiction,
however bad?  As long as you&apos;re producing, you&apos;ll know you&apos;re not
merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write
one day as an opiate.  The view of it will be obstructed by the all
too palpably flawed one you&apos;re actually writing.<br><br>&quot;Always produce&quot; is also a heuristic for finding the work you love.
If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically
push you away from things you think you&apos;re supposed to work on,
toward things you actually like.  &quot;Always produce&quot; will discover
your life&apos;s work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the
hole in your roof.<br><br>Of course, figuring out what you like to work on doesn&apos;t mean you
get to work on it.  That&apos;s a separate question.  And if you&apos;re
ambitious you have to keep them separate: you have to make a conscious
effort to keep your ideas about what you want from being contaminated
by what seems possible. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>It&apos;s painful to keep them apart, because it&apos;s painful to observe
the gap between them. So most people pre-emptively lower their
expectations.  For example, if you asked random people on the street
if they&apos;d like to be able to draw like Leonardo, you&apos;d find most
would say something like &quot;Oh, I can&apos;t draw.&quot;  This is more a statement
of intention than fact; it means, I&apos;m not going to try.  Because
the fact is, if you took a random person off the street and somehow
got them to work as hard as they possibly could at drawing for the
next twenty years, they&apos;d get surprisingly far.  But it would require
a great moral effort; it would mean staring failure in the eye every
day for years.  And so to protect themselves people say &quot;I can&apos;t.&quot;<br><br>Another related line you often hear is that not everyone can do
work they love&#x2014;that someone has to do the unpleasant jobs.  Really?
How do you make them?  In the US the only mechanism for forcing
people to do unpleasant jobs is the draft, and that hasn&apos;t been
invoked for over 30 years.  All we can do is encourage people to
do unpleasant work, with money and prestige.<br><br>If there&apos;s something people still won&apos;t do, it seems as if society
just has to make do without.  That&apos;s what happened with domestic
servants.  For millennia that was the canonical example of a job
&quot;someone had to do.&quot;  And yet in the mid twentieth century servants
practically disappeared in rich countries, and the rich have just
had to do without.<br><br>So while there may be some things someone has to do, there&apos;s a good
chance anyone saying that about any particular job is mistaken.
Most unpleasant jobs would either get automated or go undone if no
one were willing to do them.<br><br><b>Two Routes</b><br><br>There&apos;s another sense of &quot;not everyone can do work they love&quot;
that&apos;s all too true, however.  One has to make a living, and it&apos;s
hard to get paid for doing work you love.  There are two routes to
that destination:
<blockquote>
  The organic route: as you become more eminent, gradually to
  increase the parts of your job that you like at the expense of
  those you don&apos;t.<br><br>The two-job route: to work at things you don&apos;t like to get money
  to work on things you do.
</blockquote>
The organic route is more common.  It happens naturally to anyone
who does good work.  A young architect has to take whatever work
he can get, but if he does well he&apos;ll gradually be in a position
to pick and choose among projects.  The disadvantage of this route
is that it&apos;s slow and uncertain.  Even tenure is not real freedom.<br><br>The two-job route has several variants depending on how long you
work for money at a time.  At one extreme is the &quot;day job,&quot; where
you work regular hours at one job to make money, and work on what
you love in your spare time.  At the other extreme you work at
something till you make <a href="wealth.html">enough</a> not to 
have to work for money again.<br><br>The two-job route is less common than the organic route, because
it requires a deliberate choice.  It&apos;s also more dangerous.  Life
tends to get more expensive as you get older, so it&apos;s easy to get
sucked into working longer than you expected at the money job.
Worse still, anything you work on changes you.  If you work too
long on tedious stuff, it will rot your brain.  And the best paying
jobs are most dangerous, because they require your full attention.<br><br>The advantage of the two-job route is that it lets you jump over
obstacles.  The landscape of possible jobs isn&apos;t flat; there are
walls of varying heights between different kinds of work. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font>
The trick of maximizing the parts of your job that you like can get you
from architecture to product design, but not, probably, to music.
If you make money doing one thing and then work on another, you
have more freedom of choice.<br><br>Which route should you take?  That depends on how sure you are of
what you want to do, how good you are at taking orders, how much
risk you can stand, and the odds that anyone will pay (in your
lifetime) for what you want to do.  If you&apos;re sure of the general
area you want to work in and it&apos;s something people are likely to
pay you for, then you should probably take the organic route.  But
if you don&apos;t know what you want to work on, or don&apos;t like to take
orders, you may want to take the two-job route, if you can stand
the risk.<br><br>Don&apos;t decide too soon.  Kids who know early what they want to do
seem impressive, as if they got the answer to some math question
before the other kids.  They have an answer, certainly, but odds
are it&apos;s wrong.<br><br>A friend of mine who is a quite successful doctor complains constantly
about her job.  When people applying to medical school ask her for
advice, she wants to shake them and yell &quot;Don&apos;t do it!&quot;  (But she
never does.) How did she get into this fix?  In high school she
already wanted to be a doctor.  And she is so ambitious and determined
that she overcame every obstacle along the way&#x2014;including,
unfortunately, not liking it.<br><br>Now she has a life chosen for her by a high-school kid.<br><br>When you&apos;re young, you&apos;re given the impression that you&apos;ll get
enough information to make each choice before you need to make it.
But this is certainly not so with work.  When you&apos;re deciding what
to do, you have to operate on ridiculously incomplete information.
Even in college you get little idea what various types of work are
like.  At best you may have a couple internships, but not all jobs
offer internships, and those that do don&apos;t teach you much more about
the work than being a batboy teaches you about playing baseball.<br><br>In the design of lives, as in the design of most other things, you
get better results if you use flexible media.  So unless you&apos;re
fairly sure what you want to do, your best bet may be to choose a
type of work that could turn into either an organic or two-job
career.  That was probably part of the reason I chose computers.
You can be a professor, or make a lot of money, or morph it into
any number of other kinds of work.<br><br>It&apos;s also wise, early on, to seek jobs that let you do many different
things, so you can learn faster what various kinds of work are like.
Conversely, the extreme version of the two-job route is dangerous
because it teaches you so little about what you like.  If you work
hard at being a bond trader for ten years, thinking that you&apos;ll
quit and write novels when you have enough money, what happens when
you quit and then discover that you don&apos;t actually like writing
novels?<br><br>Most people would say, I&apos;d take that problem.  Give me a million
dollars and I&apos;ll figure out what to do.  But it&apos;s harder than it
looks.  Constraints give your life shape.  Remove them and most
people have no idea what to do: look at what happens to those who
win lotteries or inherit money.  Much as everyone thinks they want
financial security, the happiest people are not those who have it,
but those who like what they do.  So a plan that promises freedom
at the expense of knowing what to do with it may not be as good as
it seems.<br><br>Whichever route you take, expect a struggle.  Finding work you love
is very difficult.  Most people fail.  Even if you succeed, it&apos;s
rare to be free to work on what you want till your thirties or
forties.  But if you have the destination in sight you&apos;ll be more
likely to arrive at it.  If you know you can love work, you&apos;re in
the home stretch, and if you know what work you love, you&apos;re
practically there.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]

he preferred to work than stay home with them.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]

Donald Hall said young would-be poets were mistaken to be so
obsessed with being published.  But you can imagine what it would
do for a 24 year old to get a poem published in <i>The New Yorker</i>.
Now to people he meets at parties he&apos;s a real poet.  Actually he&apos;s
no better or worse than he was before, but to a clueless audience
like that, the approval of an official authority makes all the
difference.   So it&apos;s a harder problem than Hall realizes.  The
reason the young care so much about prestige is that the people
they want to impress are not very discerning.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
This is isomorphic to the principle that you should prevent
your beliefs about how things are from being contaminated by how
you wish they were.  Most people let them mix pretty promiscuously.

started 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y
Combinator</a>.  Or more precisely, he asked if we&apos;d started YC mainly
for fun.<br><br>Kind of, but not quite.  It is enormously fun to be able to work
with Rtm and Trevor again.  I missed that after we sold Viaweb, and
for all the years after I always had a background process running,
looking for something we could do together.  There is definitely
an aspect of a band reunion to Y Combinator.  Every couple days I
slip and call it &quot;Viaweb.&quot;<br><br>Viaweb we started very explicitly to make money.  I was sick of
living from one freelance project to the next, and decided to just
work as hard as I could till I&apos;d made enough to solve the problem
once and for all.  Viaweb was sometimes fun, but it wasn&apos;t designed
for fun, and mostly it wasn&apos;t.  I&apos;d be surprised if any startup is.
All startups are mostly schleps.<br><br>The real reason we started Y Combinator is neither selfish nor
virtuous.  We didn&apos;t start it mainly to make money; we have no idea
what our average returns might be, and won&apos;t know for years.  Nor
did we start YC mainly to help out young would-be founders, though
we do like the idea, and comfort ourselves occasionally with the
thought that if all our investments tank, we will thus have been
doing something unselfish.  (It&apos;s oddly nondeterministic.)<br><br>The real reason we started Y Combinator is one probably only a
<a href="gba.html">hacker</a> would understand.  We did it because it seems such a great
hack.  There are thousands of smart people who could start companies
and don&apos;t, and with a relatively small amount of force applied at
just the right place, we can spring on the world a stream of new
startups that might otherwise not have existed.<br><br>In a way this is virtuous, because I think startups are a good
thing.  But really what motivates us is the completely amoral desire
that would motivate any hacker who looked at some complex device
and realized that with a tiny tweak he could make it run more
efficiently.  In this case, the device is the world&apos;s economy, which
fortunately happens to be open source.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="6631327">6,631,372</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">March 2006, rev August 2009<br><br>A couple days ago I found to my surprise that I&apos;d been granted a

It issued in 2003, but no one told me.  I wouldn&apos;t know about it
now except that a few months ago, while visiting Yahoo, I happened
to run into a Big Cheese I knew from working there in the late
nineties.  He brought up something called Revenue Loop, which Viaweb
had been working on when they bought us.<br><br>The idea is basically that you sort search results not in order of
textual &quot;relevance&quot; (as search engines did then) nor in order of
how much advertisers bid (as Overture did) but in order of the bid
times the number of transactions.  Ordinarily you&apos;d do this for
shopping searches, though in fact one of the features of our scheme
is that it automatically detects which searches are shopping searches.<br><br>If you just order the results in order of bids, you can make the
search results useless, because the first results could be dominated
by lame sites that had bid the most.  But if you order results by
bid multiplied by transactions, far from selling out, you&apos;re getting
a <i>better</i> measure of relevance.  What could be a better sign that
someone was satisfied with a search result than going to the site
and buying something?<br><br>And, of course, this algorithm automatically maximizes the revenue
of the search engine.<br><br>Everyone is focused on this type of approach now, but few were in
1998.  In 1998 it was all about selling banner ads.  We didn&apos;t know
that, so we were pretty excited when we figured out what seemed to
us the optimal way of doing shopping searches.<br><br>When Yahoo was thinking of buying us, we had a meeting with Jerry
Yang in New York.  For him, I now realize, this was supposed to be
one of those meetings when you check out a company you&apos;ve pretty
much decided to buy, just to make sure they&apos;re ok guys.  We weren&apos;t
expected to do more than chat and seem smart and reasonable.  He
must have been dismayed when I jumped up to the whiteboard and
launched into a presentation of our exciting new technology.<br><br>I was just as dismayed when he didn&apos;t seem to care at all about it.
At the time I thought, &quot;boy, is this guy poker-faced.  We present
to him what has to be the optimal way of sorting product search
results, and he&apos;s not even curious.&quot;  I didn&apos;t realize till much later
why he didn&apos;t care.  In 1998, advertisers were overpaying enormously
for ads on web sites.  
In 1998, if advertisers paid the maximum that traffic was worth to
them, Yahoo&apos;s revenues would have <i>decreased.</i><br><br>Things are different now, of course.  Now this sort of thing is all
the rage.  So when I ran into the Yahoo exec I knew from the old
days in the Yahoo cafeteria a few months ago, the first thing he
remembered was not (fortunately) all the fights I had with him, but
Revenue Loop.<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;I think we actually applied for a patent on it.
I&apos;m not sure what happened to the application after I left.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Really?  That would be an important patent.&quot;<br><br>So someone investigated, and sure enough, that patent application
had continued in the pipeline for several years after, and finally
issued in 2003.<br><br>The main thing that struck me on reading it, actually, is that
lawyers at some point messed up my nice clear writing.  Some clever
person with a spell checker reduced one section to Zen-like incomprehensibility:
<blockquote>
  Also, common spelling errors will tend to get fixed. For example,
  if users searching for &quot;compact disc player&quot; end up spending
  considerable money at sites offering compact disc players, then
  those pages will have a higher relevance for that search phrase,
  even though the phrase &quot;compact disc player&quot; is not present on
  those pages.
</blockquote>
(That &quot;compat disc player&quot; wasn&apos;t a typo, guys.)<br><br>For the fine prose of the original, see the provisional application
of February 1998, back when we were still Viaweb and couldn&apos;t afford
to pay lawyers to turn every &quot;a lot of&quot; into &quot;considerable.&quot;<br><br></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="softwarepatents">Are Software Patents Evil?</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana"><!--<table width=100% cellspacing=0>

March 2006<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at Google.)</i><br><br>A few weeks ago I found to my surprise that I&apos;d been granted four <a href="http://paulgraham.infogami.com/blog/morepatents">patents</a>.  
This was all the more surprising
because I&apos;d only applied for three.  The patents aren&apos;t mine, of
course.  They were assigned to Viaweb, and became Yahoo&apos;s when they
bought us.  But the news set me thinking about the question of
software patents generally.<br><br>Patents are a hard problem.  I&apos;ve had to advise most of the startups
we&apos;ve funded about them, and despite years of experience I&apos;m still
not always sure I&apos;m giving the right advice.<br><br>One thing I do feel pretty certain of is that if you&apos;re against
software patents, you&apos;re against patents in general.  Gradually our
machines consist more and more of software.  Things that used to
be done with levers and cams and gears are now done with loops and
trees and closures.  There&apos;s nothing special about physical embodiments
of control systems that should make them patentable, and the software
equivalent not.<br><br>Unfortunately, patent law is inconsistent on this point.  Patent
law in most countries says that algorithms aren&apos;t patentable.  This
rule is left over from a time when &quot;algorithm&quot; meant something like
the Sieve of Eratosthenes.  In 1800, people could not see as readily
as we can that a great many patents on mechanical objects were
really patents on the algorithms they embodied.<br><br>Patent lawyers still have to pretend that&apos;s what they&apos;re doing when
they patent algorithms.  You must not use the word &quot;algorithm&quot; in
the title of a patent application, just as you must not use the
word &quot;essays&quot; in the title of a book.  If you want to patent an
algorithm, you have to frame it as a computer system executing that algorithm.
Then it&apos;s mechanical; phew.  The default euphemism for algorithm
is &quot;system and method.&quot;  Try a patent search for that phrase and
see how many results you get.<br><br>Since software patents are no different from hardware patents,
people who say &quot;software patents are evil&quot; are saying simply &quot;patents
are evil.&quot;  So why do so many people complain about software patents
specifically?<br><br>I think the problem is more with the patent office than the concept
of software patents.  Whenever software meets government, bad things
happen, because software changes fast and government changes slow.
The patent office has been overwhelmed by both the volume and the
novelty of applications for software patents, and as a result they&apos;ve
made a lot of mistakes.<br><br>The most common is to grant patents that shouldn&apos;t be granted.  To
be patentable, an invention has to be more than new.  It also has
to be non-obvious.  And this, especially, is where the USPTO has
been dropping the ball. Slashdot has an icon that expresses the
problem vividly: a knife and fork with the words &quot;patent pending&quot;
superimposed.<br><br>The scary thing is, this is the <i>only</i> icon they have for
patent stories.  Slashdot readers now take it for granted that a
story about a patent will be about a bogus patent.
That&apos;s how bad the problem has become.<br><br>The problem with Amazon&apos;s notorious one-click patent, for example,
is not that it&apos;s a software patent, but that it&apos;s obvious.  Any
online store that kept people&apos;s shipping addresses would have
implemented this.  The reason Amazon did it first was not that they
were especially smart, but because they were one of the earliest
sites with enough clout to force customers to log in before they
could buy something. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>We, as hackers, know the USPTO is letting people patent the knives
and forks of our world.  The problem is, the USPTO are not hackers.
They&apos;re probably good at judging new inventions for casting steel
or grinding lenses, but they don&apos;t understand software yet.<br><br>At this point an optimist would be tempted to add &quot;but they will
eventually.&quot;  Unfortunately that might not be true.  The problem
with software patents is an instance of a more general one: the
patent office takes a while to understand new technology.  If so,
this problem will only get worse, because the rate of technological
change seems to be increasing.  In thirty years, the patent office
may understand the sort of things we now patent as software, but
there will be other new types of inventions they understand even
less.<br><br>Applying for a patent is a negotiation.  You generally apply for a
broader patent than you think you&apos;ll be granted, and the examiners
reply by throwing out some of your claims and granting others.  So
I don&apos;t really blame Amazon for applying for the one-click patent.
The big mistake was the patent office&apos;s, for not insisting on
something narrower, with real technical content.  By granting such
an over-broad patent, the USPTO in effect slept with Amazon on the
first date.  Was Amazon supposed to say no?<br><br>Where Amazon went over to the dark side was not in applying for the
patent, but in enforcing it.  A lot of companies (Microsoft, for
example) have been granted large numbers of preposterously over-broad
patents,  but they keep them mainly for defensive purposes.  Like
nuclear weapons, the main role of big companies&apos; patent portfolios
is to threaten anyone who attacks them with a counter-suit.  Amazon&apos;s
suit against Barnes &amp; Noble was thus the equivalent of a nuclear
first strike.<br><br>That suit probably hurt Amazon more than it helped them.  Barnes &amp;
Noble was a lame site; Amazon would have crushed them anyway.  To
attack a rival they could have ignored, Amazon put a lasting black
mark on their own reputation.  Even now I think if you asked hackers
to free-associate about Amazon, the one-click patent would turn up
in the first ten topics.<br><br>Google clearly doesn&apos;t feel that merely holding patents is evil.
They&apos;ve applied for a lot of them.  Are they hypocrites?  Are patents
evil?<br><br>There are really two variants of that question, and people answering
it often aren&apos;t clear in their own minds which they&apos;re answering.
There&apos;s a narrow variant: is it bad, given the current legal system,
to apply for patents? and also a broader one: is it bad that the
current legal system allows patents?<br><br>These are separate questions.  For example, in preindustrial societies
like medieval Europe, when someone attacked you, you didn&apos;t call
the police.  There were no police.  When attacked, you were supposed
to fight back, and there were conventions about how to do it.  Was
this wrong?  That&apos;s two questions: was it wrong to take justice
into your own hands, and was it wrong that you had to?  We tend to
say yes to the second, but no to the first.  If no one else will
defend you, you have to defend yourself.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The situation with patents is similar.  Business is a kind of
ritualized warfare.  Indeed, it evolved from actual warfare: most
early traders switched on the fly from merchants to pirates depending
on how strong you seemed.  In business there are certain rules
describing how companies may and may not compete with one another,
and someone deciding that they&apos;re going to play by their own rules
is missing the point.  Saying &quot;I&apos;m not going to apply for patents
just because everyone else does&quot; is not like saying &quot;I&apos;m not going
to lie just because everyone else does.&quot;  It&apos;s more like saying
&quot;I&apos;m not going to use TCP/IP just because everyone else does.&quot; Oh
yes you are.<br><br>A closer comparison might be someone seeing a hockey game for the
first time, realizing with shock that the players were <i>deliberately</i>
bumping into one another, and deciding that one would on no account
be so rude when playing hockey oneself.<br><br>Hockey allows checking.  It&apos;s part of the game.  If your team refuses
to do it, you simply lose.  So it is in business.  Under the present
rules, patents are part of the game.<br><br>What does that mean in practice?  We tell the startups we fund not
to worry about infringing patents, because startups rarely get sued
for patent infringement.  There are only two reasons someone might
sue you: for money, or to prevent you from competing with them.
Startups are too poor to be worth suing for money. And in practice
they don&apos;t seem to get sued much by competitors, either.  They don&apos;t
get sued by other startups because (a) patent suits are an expensive
distraction, and (b) since the other startups are as young as they
are, their patents probably haven&apos;t issued yet. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
Nor do startups,
at least in the software business, seem to get sued much by established
competitors.  Despite all the patents Microsoft holds, I don&apos;t know
of an instance where they sued a startup for patent infringement.
Companies like Microsoft and Oracle don&apos;t win by winning lawsuits.
That&apos;s too uncertain.  They win by locking competitors out of their
sales channels.  If you do manage to threaten them, they&apos;re more
likely to buy you than sue you.<br><br>When you read of big companies filing patent suits against smaller
ones, it&apos;s usually a big company on the way down, grasping at
straws.  For example, Unisys&apos;s attempts to enforce their patent on
LZW compression.  When you see a big company threatening patent
suits, sell.  When a company starts fighting over IP, it&apos;s a sign
they&apos;ve lost the real battle, for users.<br><br>A company that sues competitors for patent infringement is like
a defender who has been beaten so thoroughly that he turns to plead
with the referee.  You don&apos;t do that if you can still reach the
ball, even if you genuinely believe you&apos;ve been fouled.  So a company
threatening patent suits is a company in <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/15/azul_sues_sun/">trouble</a>.<br><br>When we were working on Viaweb, a bigger company in the e-commerce
business was granted a patent on online ordering, or something like
that.  I got a call from a VP there asking if we&apos;d like to license
it.  I replied that I thought the patent was completely bogus, and
would never hold up in court.  &quot;Ok,&quot; he replied.  &quot;So, are you guys
hiring?&quot;<br><br>If your startup grows big enough, however, you&apos;ll start to get sued,
no matter what you do.  If you go public, for example, you&apos;ll be
sued by multiple patent trolls who hope you&apos;ll pay them off to go
away.  More on them later.<br><br>In other words, no one will sue you for patent infringement till
you have money, and once you have money, people will sue you whether
they have grounds to or not.  So I advise fatalism.  Don&apos;t waste
your time worrying about patent infringement.  You&apos;re probably
violating a patent every time you tie your shoelaces.  At the start,
at least, just worry about making something great and getting lots
of users.  If you grow to the point where anyone considers you worth
attacking, you&apos;re doing well.<br><br>We do advise the companies we fund to apply for patents, but not
so they can sue competitors.  Successful startups either get bought
or grow into big companies.  If a startup wants to grow into a big
company, they should apply for patents to build up the patent
portfolio they&apos;ll need to maintain an armed truce with other big
companies.  If they want to get bought, they should apply for patents
because patents are part of the mating dance with acquirers.<br><br>Most startups that succeed do it by getting bought, and most acquirers
care about patents.  Startup acquisitions are usually a build-vs-buy
decision for the acquirer.  Should we buy this little startup or
build our own?  And two things, especially, make them decide not
to build their own: if you already have a large and rapidly growing
user base, and if you have a fairly solid patent application on
critical parts of your software.<br><br>There&apos;s a third reason big companies should prefer buying to building:
that if they built their own, they&apos;d screw it up.  But few big
companies are smart enough yet to admit this to themselves.  It&apos;s
usually the acquirer&apos;s engineers who are asked how hard it would
be for the company to build their own, and they overestimate their
abilities.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
A patent seems to change the balance.  It gives the
acquirer an excuse to admit they couldn&apos;t copy what you&apos;re doing.
It may also help them to grasp what&apos;s special about your technology.<br><br>Frankly, it surprises me how small a role patents play in the
software business.  It&apos;s kind of ironic, considering all the dire
things experts say about software patents stifling innovation, but
when one looks closely at the software business, the most striking
thing is how little patents seem to matter.<br><br>In other fields, companies regularly sue competitors for patent
infringement.  For example, the airport baggage scanning business
was for many years a cozy duopoly shared between two companies,
InVision and L-3.  In 2002 a startup called Reveal appeared, with
new technology that let them build scanners a third the size.  They
were sued for patent infringement before they&apos;d even released a
product.<br><br>You rarely hear that kind of story in our world.  The one example
I&apos;ve found is, embarrassingly enough, Yahoo, which filed a patent
suit against a gaming startup called Xfire in 2005.  Xfire doesn&apos;t
seem to be a very big deal, and it&apos;s hard to say why Yahoo felt
threatened.  Xfire&apos;s VP of engineering had worked at Yahoo on similar
stuff-- in fact, he was listed as an inventor on the patent Yahoo
sued over-- so perhaps there was something personal about it.  My
guess is that someone at Yahoo goofed.  At any rate they didn&apos;t
pursue the suit very vigorously.<br><br>Why do patents play so small a role in software?  I can think of
three possible reasons.<br><br>One is that software is so complicated that patents by themselves
are not worth very much.  I may be maligning other fields here, but
it seems that in most types of engineering you can hand the details
of some new technique to a group of medium-high quality people and
get the desired result.  For example, if someone develops a new
process for smelting ore that gets a better yield, and you assemble
a team of qualified experts and tell them about it, they&apos;ll be able
to get the same yield.  This doesn&apos;t seem to work in software.
Software is so subtle and unpredictable that &quot;qualified experts&quot;
don&apos;t get you very far.<br><br>That&apos;s why we rarely hear phrases like &quot;qualified expert&quot; in the
software business.  What that level of ability can get you is, say,
to make your software compatible with some other piece of software--
in eight months, at enormous cost.  To do anything harder you need
individual brilliance.  If you assemble a team of qualified experts
and tell them to make a new web-based email program, they&apos;ll get
their asses kicked by a team of inspired nineteen year olds.<br><br>Experts can implement, but they can&apos;t <a href="taste.html">design</a>.
Or rather, expertise in implementation is the only kind most people,
including the experts themselves, can measure. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>But design is a definite skill.  It&apos;s not just an airy intangible.
Things always seem intangible when you don&apos;t understand them.
Electricity seemed an airy intangible to most people in 1800.  Who
knew there was so much to know about it?  So it is with design.
Some people are good at it and some people are bad at it, and there&apos;s
something very tangible they&apos;re good or bad at.<br><br>The reason design counts so much in software is probably that there
are fewer constraints than on physical things.  Building physical
things is expensive and dangerous.  The space of possible choices
is smaller; you tend to have to work as part of a larger group; and
you&apos;re subject to a lot of regulations.  You don&apos;t have any of that
if you and a couple friends decide to create a new web-based
application.<br><br>Because there&apos;s so much scope for design in software, a successful
application tends to be way more than the sum of its patents.  What
protects little companies from being copied by bigger competitors
is not just their patents, but the thousand little things the big
company will get wrong if they try.<br><br>The second reason patents don&apos;t count for much in our world is that
startups rarely attack big companies head-on, the way Reveal did.
In the software business, startups beat established companies by
transcending them.  Startups don&apos;t build desktop word processing
programs to compete with Microsoft Word. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font>
They build Writely.
If this paradigm is crowded, just wait for the next one; they run
pretty frequently on this route.<br><br>Fortunately for startups, big companies are extremely good at denial.
If you take the trouble to attack them from an oblique angle, they&apos;ll
meet you half-way and maneuver to keep you in their blind spot.  To
sue a startup would mean admitting it was dangerous, and that often
means seeing something the big company doesn&apos;t want to see.  IBM
used to sue its mainframe competitors regularly, but they didn&apos;t
bother much about the microcomputer industry because they didn&apos;t
want to see the threat it posed.  Companies building web based apps
are similarly protected from Microsoft, which even now doesn&apos;t want
to imagine a world in which Windows is irrelevant.<br><br>The third reason patents don&apos;t seem to matter very much in software
is public opinion-- or rather, hacker opinion.  In a recent <a href="http://www.computing.co.uk/forbes/news/2152720/interview-steve-ballmer-linux">interview</a>,
Steve Ballmer coyly left open the possibility of attacking Linux
on patent grounds.  But I doubt Microsoft would ever be so stupid.
They&apos;d face the mother of all boycotts.  And not just from the
technical community in general; a lot of their own people would
rebel.<br><br>Good hackers care a lot about matters of principle, and they are
highly mobile.  If a company starts misbehaving, smart people won&apos;t
work there.  For some reason this seems to be more true in software
than other businesses.  I don&apos;t think it&apos;s because hackers have
intrinsically higher principles so much as that their skills are
easily transferrable.  Perhaps we can split the difference and say
that mobility gives hackers the luxury of being principled.<br><br>Google&apos;s &quot;don&apos;t be evil&quot; policy may for this reason be the most
valuable thing they&apos;ve discovered.  It&apos;s very constraining in some
ways.  If Google does do something evil, they get doubly whacked
for it: once for whatever they did, and again for hypocrisy.  But
I think it&apos;s worth it.  It helps them to hire the best people, and
it&apos;s better, even from a purely selfish point of view, to be
constrained by principles than by stupidity.<br><br>(I wish someone would get this point across to the present
administration.)<br><br>I&apos;m not sure what the proportions are of the preceding three
ingredients, but the custom among the big companies seems to be not
to sue the small ones, and the startups are mostly too busy and too
poor to sue one another.  So despite the huge number of software
patents there&apos;s not a lot of suing going on.  With one exception:
patent trolls.<br><br>Patent trolls are companies consisting mainly of lawyers whose whole
business is to accumulate patents and threaten to sue companies who
actually make things.  Patent trolls, it seems safe to say, are
evil.  I feel a bit stupid saying that, because when you&apos;re saying
something that Richard Stallman and Bill Gates would both agree
with, you must be perilously close to tautologies.<br><br>The CEO of Forgent, one of the most notorious patent trolls, says
that what his company does is &quot;the American way.&quot; Actually that&apos;s
not true. The American way is to make money by <a href="wealth.html">creating wealth</a>, not by suing people. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font>
What companies like Forgent do is actually the proto-industrial
way.  In the period just before the industrial revolution, some of
the greatest fortunes in countries like England and France were
made by courtiers who extracted some lucrative right from the crown--
like the right to collect taxes on the import of silk-- and then
used this to squeeze money from the merchants in that business.  So
when people compare patent trolls to the mafia, they&apos;re more right
than they know, because the mafia too are not merely bad, but bad
specifically in the sense of being an obsolete business model.<br><br>Patent trolls seem to have caught big companies by surprise.  In
the last couple years they&apos;ve extracted hundreds of millions of
dollars from them.  Patent trolls are hard to fight precisely because
they create nothing.  Big companies are safe from being sued by
other big companies because they can threaten a counter-suit.  But
because patent trolls don&apos;t make anything, there&apos;s nothing they can
be sued for.  I predict this loophole will get closed fairly quickly,
at least by legal standards.  It&apos;s clearly an abuse of the system,
and the victims are powerful.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>But evil as patent trolls are, I don&apos;t think they hamper innovation
much.  They don&apos;t sue till a startup has made money, and by that
point the innovation that generated it has already happened.  I
can&apos;t think of a startup that avoided working on some problem because
of patent trolls.<br><br>So much for hockey as the game is played now.  What about the more
theoretical question of whether hockey would be a better game without
checking?  Do patents encourage or discourage innovation?<br><br>This is a very hard question to answer in the general case.  People
write whole books on the topic.  One of my main hobbies is the
history of technology, and even though I&apos;ve studied the subject for
years, it would take me several weeks of research to be able to say
whether patents have in general been a net win.<br><br>One thing I can say is that 99.9% of the people who express opinions
on the subject do it not based on such research, but out of a kind
of religious conviction.  At least, that&apos;s the polite way of putting
it; the colloquial version involves speech coming out of organs not
designed for that purpose.<br><br>Whether they encourage innovation or not, patents were at least
intended to.  You don&apos;t get a patent for nothing.  In return for
the exclusive right to use an idea, you have to <i>publish</i> it,
and it was largely to encourage such openness that patents were
established.<br><br>Before patents, people protected ideas by keeping them secret.  With
patents, central governments said, in effect, if you tell everyone
your idea, we&apos;ll protect it for you.  There is a parallel here to
the rise of civil order, which happened at roughly the same time.
Before central governments were powerful enough to enforce order,
rich people had private armies.  As governments got more powerful,
they gradually compelled magnates to cede most responsibility for
protecting them.  (Magnates still have bodyguards, but no longer
to protect them from other magnates.)<br><br>Patents, like police, are involved in many abuses.  But in both
cases the default is something worse. The choice is not &quot;patents
or freedom?&quot; any more than it is &quot;police or freedom?&quot; The actual
questions are respectively &quot;patents or secrecy?&quot; and &quot;police or
gangs?&quot;<br><br>As with gangs, we have some idea what secrecy would be like, because
that&apos;s how things used to be.  The economy of medieval Europe was
divided up into little tribes, each jealously guarding their
privileges and secrets.  In Shakespeare&apos;s time, &quot;mystery&quot; was
synonymous with &quot;craft.&quot;   Even today we can see an echo of the
secrecy of medieval guilds, in the now pointless secrecy of the
Masons.<br><br>The most memorable example of medieval industrial secrecy is probably
Venice, which forbade glassblowers to leave the city, and sent
assassins after those who tried.  We might like to think we wouldn&apos;t
go so far, but the movie industry has already tried to pass <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1026_3-5106684.html">laws</a>
prescribing three year prison terms just for putting movies on
public networks.  Want to try a frightening thought experiment? If
the movie industry could have any law they wanted, where would they
stop?  Short of the death penalty, one assumes, but how close would
they get?<br><br>Even worse than the spectacular abuses might be the overall decrease
in efficiency that would accompany increased secrecy.  As anyone
who has dealt with organizations that operate on a &quot;need to know&quot;
basis can attest, dividing information up into little cells is
terribly inefficient.  The flaw in the &quot;need to know&quot; principle is
that you don&apos;t <i>know</i> who needs to know something.  An idea
from one area might spark a great discovery in another.  But the
discoverer doesn&apos;t know he needs to know it.<br><br>If secrecy were the only protection for ideas, companies wouldn&apos;t
just have to be secretive with other companies; they&apos;d have to be
secretive internally.  This would encourage what is already the
worst trait of big companies.<br><br>I&apos;m not saying secrecy would be worse than patents, just that we
couldn&apos;t discard patents for free.  Businesses would become more
secretive to compensate, and in some fields this might get ugly.
Nor am I defending the current patent system.  There is clearly a
lot that&apos;s broken about it.   But the breakage seems to affect
software less than most other fields.<br><br>In the software business I know from experience whether patents
encourage or discourage innovation, and the answer is the type that
people who like to argue about public policy least like to hear:
they don&apos;t affect innovation much, one way or the other.  Most
innovation in the software business happens in startups, and startups
should simply ignore other companies&apos; patents.  At least, that&apos;s
what we advise, and we bet money on that advice.<br><br>The only real role of patents, for most startups, is as an element
of the mating dance with acquirers.  There patents do help a little.
And so they do encourage innovation indirectly, in that they give
more power to startups, which is where, pound for pound, the most
innovation happens.  But even in the mating dance, patents are of
secondary importance.  It matters more to make something great and
get a lot of users.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
You have to be careful here, because a great discovery often
seems obvious in retrospect.  One-click ordering, however, is not
such a discovery.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
&quot;Turn the other cheek&quot; skirts the issue; the critical question
is not how to deal with slaps, but sword thrusts.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Applying for a patent is now very slow, but it might actually
be bad if that got fixed.  At the moment the time it takes to get
a patent is conveniently just longer than the time it takes a startup
to succeed or fail.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Instead of the canonical &quot;could you build this?&quot; maybe the corp
dev guys should be asking &quot;will you build this?&quot; or even &quot;why haven&apos;t
you already built this?&quot;<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Design ability is so hard to measure that you can&apos;t even trust
the design world&apos;s internal standards.  You can&apos;t assume that someone
with a degree in design is any good at design, or that an eminent
designer is any better than his peers.  If that worked, any company
could build products as good as Apple&apos;s just by hiring 
sufficiently qualified designers.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
If anyone wanted to try, we&apos;d be interested to hear from them.
I suspect it&apos;s one of those things that&apos;s not as hard as everyone
assumes.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Patent trolls can&apos;t even claim, like speculators, that they
&quot;create&quot; liquidity.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
If big companies don&apos;t want to wait for the government to take
action, there is a way to fight back themselves.  For a long time
I thought there wasn&apos;t, because there was nothing to grab onto.
But there is one resource patent trolls need: lawyers.  Big technology
companies between them generate a lot of legal business.  If they
agreed among themselves never to do business with any firm employing
anyone who had worked for a patent troll, either as an employee or
as outside counsel, they could probably starve the trolls of the
lawyers they need.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Dan Bloomberg, Paul Buchheit, Sarah Harlin,

living.&quot;  Part of what he meant was that the proper role of humans is to
think, just as the proper role of anteaters is to poke their noses
into anthills.<br><br>A lot of ancient philosophy had the quality&#x2014;and I
don&apos;t mean this in an insulting way&#x2014;of the kind of conversations
freshmen have late at night in common rooms:
<blockquote>
What is our purpose?  Well, we humans are
as conspicuously different from other animals as the anteater.
In our case the distinguishing feature is the ability to reason.
So obviously that is what we should be doing, and a human who
doesn&apos;t is doing a bad job of being human&#x2014;is no better than an
animal.
</blockquote>
Now we&apos;d give a different answer.  At least, someone Socrates&apos;s age
would.  We&apos;d ask why we even suppose we have a &quot;purpose&quot; in life.
We may be better adapted for some things than others; we
may be happier doing things we&apos;re adapted for; but why assume
purpose?<br><br>The history of ideas
is a history of gradually discarding the assumption that it&apos;s all
about us.  No, it turns out, the earth is not the center of the
universe&#x2014;not even the center of the solar system.  No, it turns
out, humans are not created by God in his own image; they&apos;re just
one species among many, descended not merely from apes, but from
microorganisms.  Even the concept of &quot;me&quot; turns out to be fuzzy
around the edges if you examine it closely.<br><br>The idea that we&apos;re the center of things is difficult to discard.
So difficult that there&apos;s probably room to discard more.  Richard
Dawkins made another step in that direction only in the last several
decades, with the idea of the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene">selfish gene</a>.   
No, it turns
out, we&apos;re not even the protagonists: we&apos;re just the latest model
vehicle our genes have constructed to travel around in.  And having
kids is our genes heading for the lifeboats.  Reading
that book snapped my brain out of its previous way of thinking the
way Darwin&apos;s must have when it first appeared.<br><br>(Few people can experience now what Darwin&apos;s contemporaries did
when <i>The Origin of Species</i> was first published, because everyone
now is raised either to take evolution for granted, or to regard
it as a heresy. No one encounters the idea of natural selection for
the first time as an adult.)<br><br>So if you want to discover things that have been overlooked till
now, one really good place to look is in our blind spot: in our
natural, naive belief that it&apos;s all about us.  And expect to encounter
ferocious opposition if you do.<br><br>Conversely, if you have to choose between two theories, prefer the
one that doesn&apos;t center on you.<br><br>This principle isn&apos;t only for big ideas.  It works in everyday life,
too.  For example, suppose you&apos;re saving a piece of cake in the fridge, and you
come home one day to find your housemate has eaten
it.  Two possible theories:
<blockquote>
a) Your housemate did it deliberately to upset you.  He <i>knew</i>
you were saving that piece of cake.<br><br>b) Your housemate was hungry.
</blockquote>
I say pick b.  No one knows who said &quot;never attribute to malice what
can be explained by incompetence,&quot; but it is a powerful idea.
Its more general version is our answer to the Greeks:

<a href="http://startupschool.org">Startup School</a>.)</i><br><br>The startups we&apos;ve funded so far are pretty quick, but they seem
quicker to learn some lessons than others.  I think it&apos;s because
some things about startups are kind of counterintuitive.<br><br>We&apos;ve now 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com">invested</a> 
in enough companies that I&apos;ve learned a trick
for determining which points are the counterintuitive ones:
they&apos;re the ones I have to keep repeating.<br><br>So I&apos;m going to number these points, and maybe with future startups
I&apos;ll be able to pull off a form of Huffman coding. I&apos;ll make them
all read this, and then instead of nagging them in detail, I&apos;ll
just be able to say: <i>number four!</i><br><br>
<b>1. Release Early.</b><br><br>The thing I probably repeat most is this recipe for a startup: get
a version 1 out fast, then improve it based on users&apos; reactions.<br><br>By &quot;release early&quot; I don&apos;t mean you should release something full
of bugs, but that you should release something minimal.  Users hate
bugs, but they don&apos;t seem to mind a minimal version 1, if there&apos;s
more coming soon.<br><br>There are several reasons it pays to get version 1 done fast.  One
is that this is simply the right way to write software, whether for
a startup or not.  I&apos;ve been repeating that since 1993, and I haven&apos;t seen much since to
contradict it.  I&apos;ve seen a lot of startups die because they were
too slow to release stuff, and none because they were too quick.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>One of the things that will surprise you if you build something
popular is that you won&apos;t know your users.  <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> now has almost half a million
unique visitors a month.  Who are all those people?  They have no
idea.  No web startup does.  And since you don&apos;t know your users,
it&apos;s dangerous to guess what they&apos;ll like.  Better to release
something and let them tell you.<br><br><a href="http://wufoo.com">Wufoo</a> took this to heart and released
their form-builder before the underlying database.  You can&apos;t even
drive the thing yet, but 83,000 people came to sit in the driver&apos;s
seat and hold the steering wheel.  And Wufoo got valuable feedback
from it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so they
rewrote their software not to.  If they&apos;d waited to release everything
at once, they wouldn&apos;t have discovered this problem till it was
more deeply wired in.<br><br>Even if you had no users, it would still be important to release
quickly, because for a startup the initial release acts as a shakedown
cruise.  If anything major is broken-- if the idea&apos;s no good,
for example, or the founders hate one another-- the stress of getting
that first version out will expose it.  And if you have such problems
you want to find them early.<br><br>Perhaps the most important reason to release early, though, is that
it makes you work harder.  When you&apos;re working on something that
isn&apos;t released, problems are intriguing.  In something that&apos;s out
there, problems are alarming.  There is a lot more urgency once you
release.  And I think that&apos;s precisely why people put it off.  They
know they&apos;ll have to work a lot harder once they do. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>2. Keep Pumping Out Features.</b><br><br>Of course, &quot;release early&quot; has a second component, without which
it would be bad advice.  If you&apos;re going to start with something
that doesn&apos;t do much, you better improve it fast.<br><br>What I find myself repeating is &quot;pump out features.&quot;  And this rule
isn&apos;t just for the initial stages.  This is something all startups
should do for as long as they want to be considered startups.<br><br>I don&apos;t mean, of course, that you should make your application ever
more complex.  By &quot;feature&quot; I mean one unit of hacking-- one quantum
of making users&apos; lives better.<br><br>As with exercise, improvements beget improvements.  If you run every
day, you&apos;ll probably feel like running tomorrow.  But if you skip
running for a couple weeks, it will be an effort to drag yourself
out.  So it is with hacking: the more ideas you implement, the more
ideas you&apos;ll have.  You should make your system better at least in
some small way every day or two.<br><br>This is not just a good way to get development done; it is also a
form of marketing.  Users love a site that&apos;s constantly improving.
In fact, users expect a site to improve.  Imagine if you visited a
site that seemed very good, and then returned two months later and
not one thing had changed.  Wouldn&apos;t it start to seem lame? 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>They&apos;ll like you even better when you improve in response to their
comments, because customers are used to companies ignoring them.
If you&apos;re the rare exception-- a company that actually listens--
you&apos;ll generate fanatical loyalty.  You won&apos;t need to advertise,
because your users will do it for you.<br><br>This seems obvious too, so why do I have to keep repeating it?  I
think the problem here is that people get used to how things are.
Once a product gets past the stage where it has glaring flaws, you
start to get used to it, and gradually whatever features it happens
to have become its identity.  For example, I doubt many people at
Yahoo (or Google for that matter) realized how much better web mail
could be till Paul Buchheit showed them.<br><br>I think the solution is to assume that anything you&apos;ve made is far
short of what it could be.  Force yourself, as a sort of intellectual
exercise, to keep thinking of improvements.  Ok, sure, what you
have is perfect.  But if you had to change something, what would
it be?<br><br>If your product seems finished, there are two possible explanations:
(a) it is finished, or (b) you lack imagination.  Experience suggests
(b) is a thousand times more likely.<br><br>
<b>3. Make Users Happy.</b><br><br>Improving constantly is an instance of a more general rule: make
users happy.  One thing all startups have in common is that they
can&apos;t force anyone to do anything.  They can&apos;t force anyone to use
their software, and they can&apos;t force anyone to do deals with them.
A startup has to sing for its supper.  That&apos;s why the successful
ones make great things.  They have to, or die.<br><br>When you&apos;re running a startup you feel like a little bit of debris
blown about by powerful winds.  The most powerful wind is users.
They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky, as they did
with Google, or leave you flat on the pavement, as they do with
most startups.  Users are a fickle wind, but more powerful than any
other.  If they take you up, no competitor can keep you down.<br><br>As a little piece of debris, the rational thing for you to do is
not to lie flat, but to curl yourself into a shape the wind will
catch.<br><br>I like the wind metaphor because it reminds you how impersonal the
stream of traffic is.  The vast majority of people who visit your
site will be casual visitors.  It&apos;s them you have to design your
site for.  The people who really care will find what they want by
themselves.<br><br>The median visitor will arrive with their finger poised on the Back
button.  Think about your own experience: most links you
follow lead to something lame.  Anyone who has used the web for
more than a couple weeks has been <i>trained</i> to click on Back after
following a link.  So your site has to say &quot;Wait!  Don&apos;t click on
Back.  This site isn&apos;t lame.  Look at this, for example.&quot;<br><br>There are two things you have to do to make people pause.  The most
important is to explain, as concisely as possible, what the hell
your site is about.  How often have you visited a site that seemed
to assume you already knew what they did?  For example, the corporate
<xa href="http://www.interwoven.com/company/">site that says the
company makes
<blockquote>
  enterprise content management solutions for business that enable
  organizations to unify people, content and processes to minimize
  business risk, accelerate time-to-value and sustain lower total
  cost of ownership.
</blockquote>
An established company may get away with such an opaque description,
but no startup can.  A startup
should be able to explain in one or two sentences exactly what it
does. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
And not just to users.  You need this for everyone:
investors, acquirers, partners, reporters, potential employees, and
even current employees.  You probably shouldn&apos;t even start a company
to do something that can&apos;t be described compellingly in one or two
sentences.<br><br>The other thing I repeat is to give people everything you&apos;ve got,
right away.  If you have something impressive, try to put it on the
front page, because that&apos;s the only one most visitors will see.
Though indeed there&apos;s a paradox here: the more you push the good
stuff toward the front, the more likely visitors are to explore
further. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>In the best case these two suggestions get combined: you tell
visitors what your site is about by <i>showing</i> them.  One of the
standard pieces of advice in fiction writing is &quot;show, don&apos;t tell.&quot;
Don&apos;t say that a character&apos;s angry; have him grind his teeth, or
break his pencil in half.  Nothing will explain what your site does
so well as using it.<br><br>The industry term here is &quot;conversion.&quot;  The job of your site is
to convert casual visitors into users-- whatever your definition
of a user is.  You can measure this in your growth rate.  Either
your site is catching on, or it isn&apos;t, and you must know which.  If
you have decent growth, you&apos;ll win in the end, no matter how obscure
you are now.  And if you don&apos;t, you need to fix something.<br><br>
<b>4. Fear the Right Things.</b><br><br>Another thing I find myself saying a lot is &quot;don&apos;t worry.&quot;  Actually,
it&apos;s more often &quot;don&apos;t worry about this; worry about that instead.&quot;
Startups are right to be paranoid, but they sometimes fear the wrong
things.<br><br>Most visible disasters are not so alarming as they seem.  Disasters
are normal in a startup: a founder quits, you discover a patent
that covers what you&apos;re doing, your servers keep crashing, you run
into an insoluble technical problem, you have to change your name,
a deal falls through-- these are all par for the course.  They won&apos;t
kill you unless you let them.<br><br>Nor will most competitors.  A lot of startups worry &quot;what if Google
builds something like us?&quot;  Actually big companies are not the ones
you have to worry about-- not even Google.  The people at Google
are smart, but no smarter than you; they&apos;re not as motivated, because
Google is not going to go out of business if this one product fails;
and even at Google they have a lot of bureaucracy to slow them down.<br><br>What you should fear, as a startup, is not the established players,
but other startups you don&apos;t know exist yet.  They&apos;re way more
dangerous than Google because, like you, they&apos;re cornered animals.<br><br>Looking just at existing competitors can give you a false sense of
security.  You should compete against what someone else <i>could</i> be
doing, not just what you can see people doing.  A corollary is that
you shouldn&apos;t relax just because you have no visible competitors
yet.  No matter what your idea, there&apos;s someone else out there
working on the same thing.<br><br>That&apos;s the downside of it being easier to start a startup: more people
are doing it.  But I disagree with Caterina Fake when she says that
makes this a bad time to start a startup.  More people are starting
startups, but not as many more as could.  Most college graduates
still think they have to get a job.  The average person can&apos;t ignore
something that&apos;s been beaten into their head since they were three
just because serving web pages recently got a lot cheaper.<br><br>And in any case, competitors are not the biggest threat.  Way more
startups hose themselves than get crushed by competitors.  There
are a lot of ways to do it, but the three main ones are internal
disputes, inertia, and ignoring users.  Each is, by itself, enough
to kill you.  But if I had to pick the worst, it would be ignoring
users.  If you want a recipe for a startup that&apos;s going to die,
here it is: a couple of founders who have some great idea they know
everyone is going to love, and that&apos;s what they&apos;re going to build,
no matter what.<br><br>Almost everyone&apos;s initial plan is broken.  If companies stuck to
their initial plans, Microsoft would be selling programming languages,
and Apple would be selling printed circuit boards.  In both cases
their customers told them what their business should be-- and they
were smart enough to listen.<br><br>As Richard Feynman said, the imagination of nature is greater than
the imagination of man.  You&apos;ll find more interesting things by
looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking.
This principle is very powerful.  It&apos;s why the best abstract painting
still falls short of Leonardo, for example.  And it applies to
startups too.  No idea for a product could ever be so clever as the
ones you can discover by smashing a beam of prototypes into a beam
of users.<br><br>
<b>5. Commitment Is a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.</b><br><br>I now have enough experience with startups to be able to say what
the most important quality is in a startup founder, and it&apos;s not
what you might think.  The most important quality in a startup
founder is determination.  Not intelligence-- determination.<br><br>This is a little depressing.  I&apos;d like to believe Viaweb succeeded
because we were smart, not merely determined.  A lot of people in
the startup world want to believe that.  Not just founders, but
investors too.  They like the idea of inhabiting a world ruled by
intelligence.  And you can tell they really believe this, because
it affects their investment decisions.<br><br>Time after time VCs invest in startups founded by eminent professors.
This may work in biotech, where a lot of startups simply commercialize
existing research, but in software you want to invest in students,
not professors.  Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google were all founded by
people who dropped out of school to do it.  What students lack in
experience they more than make up in dedication.<br><br>Of course, if you want to get rich, it&apos;s not enough merely to be
determined.  You have to be smart too, right?  I&apos;d like to think
so, but I&apos;ve had an experience that convinced me otherwise: I spent
several years living in New York.<br><br>You can lose quite a lot in the brains department and it won&apos;t kill
you.  But lose even a little bit in the commitment department, and
that will kill you very rapidly.<br><br>Running a startup is like walking on your hands: it&apos;s possible, but
it requires extraordinary effort.  If an ordinary employee were
asked to do the things a startup founder has to, he&apos;d be very
indignant.  Imagine if you were hired at some big company, and in
addition to writing software ten times faster than you&apos;d ever had
to before, they expected you to answer support calls, administer
the servers, design the web site, cold-call customers, find the
company office space, and go out and get everyone lunch.<br><br>And to do all this not in the calm, womb-like atmosphere of a big
company, but against a backdrop of constant disasters.  That&apos;s the
part that really demands determination.  In a startup, there&apos;s
always some disaster happening.  So if you&apos;re the least bit inclined
to find an excuse to quit, there&apos;s always one right there.<br><br>But if you lack commitment, chances are it will have been hurting
you long before you actually quit.  Everyone who deals with startups
knows how important commitment is, so if they sense you&apos;re ambivalent,
they won&apos;t give you much attention.  If you lack commitment, you&apos;ll
just find that for some mysterious reason good things happen to
your competitors but not to you.  If you lack commitment, it will
seem to you that you&apos;re unlucky.<br><br>Whereas if you&apos;re determined to stick around, people will pay
attention to you, because odds are they&apos;ll have to deal with you
later.  You&apos;re a local, not just a tourist, so everyone has to come
to terms with you.<br><br>At Y Combinator we sometimes mistakenly fund teams who have the
attitude that they&apos;re going to give this startup thing a shot for
three months, and if something great happens, they&apos;ll stick with
it-- &quot;something great&quot; meaning either that someone wants to buy
them or invest millions of dollars in them.  But if this is your
attitude, &quot;something great&quot; is very unlikely to happen to you,
because both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of
commitment.<br><br>If an acquirer thinks you&apos;re going to stick around no matter what,
they&apos;ll be more likely to buy you, because if they don&apos;t and you
stick around, you&apos;ll probably grow, your price will go up, and
they&apos;ll be left wishing they&apos;d bought you earlier.  Ditto for
investors.  What really motivates investors, even big VCs, is not
the hope of good returns, but the fear of missing out. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font>
So if
you make it clear you&apos;re going to succeed no matter what, and the only
reason you need them is to make it happen a little faster, you&apos;re
much more likely to get money.<br><br>You can&apos;t fake this.  The only way to convince everyone that you&apos;re
ready to fight to the death is actually to be ready to.<br><br>You have to be the right kind of determined, though.  I carefully
chose the word determined rather than stubborn, because stubbornness
is a disastrous quality in a startup.  You have to be determined,
but flexible, like a running back.  A successful running back doesn&apos;t
just put his head down and try to run through people.  He improvises:
if someone appears in front of him, he runs around them; if someone
tries to grab him, he spins out of their grip; he&apos;ll even run in
the wrong direction briefly if that will help.  The one thing he&apos;ll
never do is stand still. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>6. There Is Always Room.</b><br><br>I was talking recently to a startup founder about whether it might
be good to add a social component to their software.  He said he
didn&apos;t think so, because the whole social thing was tapped out.
Really?  So in a hundred years the only social networking sites
will be the Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, and Del.icio.us?  Not likely.<br><br>There is always room for new stuff.  At every point in history,
even the darkest bits of the dark ages, people were discovering
things that made everyone say &quot;why didn&apos;t anyone think of that
before?&quot;  We know this continued to be true up till 2004, when the
Facebook was founded-- though strictly speaking someone else did
think of that.<br><br>The reason we don&apos;t see the opportunities all around us is that we
adjust to however things are, and assume that&apos;s how things have to
be.  For example, it would seem crazy to most people to try to make
a better search engine than Google.  Surely that field, at least,
is tapped out.  Really?  In a hundred years-- or even twenty-- are
people still going to search for information using something like
the current Google?  Even Google probably doesn&apos;t think that.<br><br>In particular, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any limit to the number of
startups.  Sometimes you hear people saying &quot;All these guys starting
startups now are going to be disappointed. How many little startups
are Google and Yahoo going to buy, after all?&quot; That sounds cleverly
skeptical, but I can prove it&apos;s mistaken.  No one proposes that
there&apos;s some limit to the number of people who can be employed in
an economy consisting of big, slow-moving companies with a couple
thousand people each.  Why should there be any limit to the number
who could be employed by small, fast-moving companies with ten each?
It seems to me the only limit would be the number of people who
want to work that hard.<br><br>The limit on the number of startups is not the number that can get
acquired by Google and Yahoo-- though it seems even that should
be unlimited, if the startups were actually worth buying-- but the
amount of wealth that can be created.  And I don&apos;t think there&apos;s
any limit on that, except cosmological ones.<br><br>So for all practical purposes, there is no limit to the number of
startups.  Startups make wealth, which means they make things people
want, and if there&apos;s a limit on the number of things people want,
we are nowhere near it.  I still don&apos;t even have a flying car.<br><br>
<b>7. Don&apos;t Get Your Hopes Up.</b><br><br>This is another one I&apos;ve been repeating since long before Y Combinator.
It was practically the corporate motto at Viaweb.<br><br>Startup founders are naturally optimistic.  They wouldn&apos;t do it
otherwise.  But you should treat your optimism the way you&apos;d treat
the core of a nuclear reactor: as a source of power that&apos;s also
very dangerous.  You have to build a shield around it, or it will
fry you.<br><br>The shielding of a reactor is not uniform; the reactor would be
useless if it were.  It&apos;s pierced in a few places to let pipes in.
An optimism shield has to be pierced too.  I think the place to
draw the line is between what you expect of yourself, and what you
expect of other people.  It&apos;s ok to be optimistic about what you
can do, but assume the worst about machines and other people.<br><br>This is particularly necessary in a startup, because you tend to
be pushing the limits of whatever you&apos;re doing.  So things don&apos;t
happen in the smooth, predictable way they do in the rest of the
world.  Things change suddenly, and usually for the worse.<br><br>Shielding your optimism is nowhere more important than with deals.
If your startup is doing a deal, just assume it&apos;s not going to
happen.  The VCs who say they&apos;re going to invest in you aren&apos;t.
The company that says they&apos;re going to buy you isn&apos;t.  The big
customer who wants to use your system in their whole company won&apos;t.
Then if things work out you can be pleasantly surprised.<br><br>The reason I warn startups not to get their hopes up is not to save
them from being <i>disappointed</i> when things fall through.  It&apos;s
for a more practical reason: to prevent them from leaning their
company against something that&apos;s going to fall over, taking them
with it.<br><br>For example, if someone says they want to invest in you, there&apos;s a
natural tendency to stop looking for other investors.  That&apos;s why
people proposing deals seem so positive: they <i>want</i> you to
stop looking.  And you want to stop too, because doing deals is a
pain.  Raising money, in particular, is a huge time sink.  So you
have to consciously force yourself to keep looking.<br><br>Even if you ultimately do the first deal, it will be to your advantage
to have kept looking, because you&apos;ll get better terms.  Deals are
dynamic; unless you&apos;re negotiating with someone unusually honest,
there&apos;s not a single point where you shake hands and the deal&apos;s
done. There are usually a lot of subsidiary questions to be cleared
up after the handshake, and if the other side senses weakness-- if
they sense you need this deal-- they will be very tempted to screw
you in the details.<br><br>VCs and corp dev guys are professional negotiators.  They&apos;re trained
to take advantage of weakness. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font>
So while they&apos;re often nice
guys, they just can&apos;t help it.  And as pros they do this more than
you.  So don&apos;t even try to bluff them.  The only way a startup can
have any leverage in a deal is genuinely not to need it.  And if
you don&apos;t believe in a deal, you&apos;ll be less likely to depend on it.<br><br>So I want to plant a hypnotic suggestion in your heads: when you
hear someone say the words &quot;we want to invest in you&quot; or &quot;we want
to acquire you,&quot; I want the following phrase to appear automatically
in your head: <i>don&apos;t get your hopes up.</i>  Just continue running
your company as if this deal didn&apos;t exist.  Nothing is more likely
to make it close.<br><br>The way to succeed in a startup is to focus on the goal of getting
lots of users, and keep walking swiftly toward it while investors
and acquirers scurry alongside trying to wave money in your face.<br><br>
<b>Speed, not Money</b><br><br>The way I&apos;ve described it, starting a startup sounds pretty stressful.
It is.  When I talk to the founders of the companies we&apos;ve funded,
they all say the same thing: I knew it would be hard, but I didn&apos;t
realize it would be this hard.<br><br>So why do it?  It would be worth enduring a lot of pain and stress
to do something grand or heroic, but just to make money?  Is making
money really that important?<br><br>No, not really.  It seems ridiculous to me when people take business
too seriously.  I regard making money as a boring errand to be got
out of the way as soon as possible.  There is nothing grand or
heroic about starting a startup per se.<br><br>So why do I spend so much time thinking about startups?  I&apos;ll tell
you why.  Economically, a startup is best seen not as a way to get
rich, but as a way to work faster.  You have to make a living, and
a startup is a way to get that done quickly, instead of letting it
drag on through your whole life.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>We take it for granted most of the time, but human life is fairly
miraculous.  It is also palpably short.  You&apos;re given this marvellous
thing, and then poof, it&apos;s taken away.  You can see why people
invent gods to explain it.  But even to people who don&apos;t believe
in gods, life commands respect.  There are times in most of our
lives when the days go by in a blur, and almost everyone has a
sense, when this happens, of wasting something precious.  As Ben
Franklin said, if you love life, don&apos;t waste time, because time is
what life is made of.<br><br>So no, there&apos;s nothing particularly grand about making money.  That&apos;s
not what makes startups worth the trouble.  What&apos;s important about
startups is the speed.  By compressing the dull but necessary task
of making a living into the smallest possible time, you show respect
for life, and there is something grand about that.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Startups can die from releasing something full of bugs, and not
fixing them fast enough, but I don&apos;t know of any that died from

improving it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]

A web site is different from a book or movie or desktop application
in this respect.  Users judge a site not as a single snapshot, but
as an animation with multiple frames.  Of the two, I&apos;d say the rate of
improvement is more important to users than where you currently
are.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
It should not always tell this to users, however.  For example,
MySpace is basically a replacement mall for mallrats.  But it was
wiser for them, initially, to pretend that the site was about bands.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Similarly, don&apos;t make users register to try your site.  Maybe
what you have is so valuable that visitors should gladly register
to get at it.  But they&apos;ve been trained to expect the opposite.
Most of the things they&apos;ve tried on the web have sucked-- and
probably especially those that made them register.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
VCs have rational reasons for behaving this way. They don&apos;t
make their money (if they make money) off their median investments.
In a typical fund, half the companies fail, most of the rest generate
mediocre returns, and one or two &quot;make the fund&quot; by succeeding
spectacularly.  So if they miss just a few of the most promising
opportunities, it could hose the whole fund.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
The attitude of a running back doesn&apos;t translate to soccer.
Though it looks great when a forward dribbles past multiple defenders,
a player who persists in trying such things will do worse in the
long term than one who passes.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]

There are two ways to do 
<a href="love.html">work you love</a>: (a) to make money, then work
on what you love, or (b) to get a job where you get paid to work on
stuff you love.  In practice the first phases of both
consist mostly of unedifying schleps, and in (b) the second phase is less
secure.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Beau Hartshorne, Jessica

unique about it?<br><br>It wouldn&apos;t be surprising if it were hard to reproduce in other
countries, because you couldn&apos;t reproduce it in most of the US
either.  What does it take to make a silicon valley even here?<br><br>What it takes is the right people.  If you could get the right ten
thousand people to move from Silicon Valley to Buffalo, Buffalo
would become Silicon Valley.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>That&apos;s a striking departure from the past.  Up till a couple decades
ago, geography was destiny for cities.  All great cities were located
on waterways, because cities made money by trade, and water was the
only economical way to ship.<br><br>Now you could make a great city anywhere, if you could get the right
people to move there.  So the question of how to make a silicon
valley becomes: who are the right people, and how do you get them
to move?<br><br><b>Two Types</b><br><br>I think you only need two kinds of people to create a technology
hub: rich people and nerds.  They&apos;re the limiting reagents in the
reaction that produces startups, because they&apos;re the only ones
present when startups get started.  Everyone else will move.<br><br>Observation bears this out: within the US, towns have become startup
hubs if and only if they have both rich people and nerds.  Few
startups happen in Miami, for example, because although it&apos;s full
of rich people, it has few nerds.  It&apos;s not the kind of place nerds
like.<br><br>Whereas Pittsburgh has the opposite problem: plenty of nerds, but
no rich people.  The top US Computer Science departments are said
to be MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, and Carnegie-Mellon.  MIT yielded
Route 128.  Stanford and Berkeley yielded Silicon Valley.  But
Carnegie-Mellon?  The record skips at that point.  Lower down the
list, the University of Washington yielded a high-tech community
in Seattle, and the University of Texas at Austin yielded one in
Austin.  But what happened in Pittsburgh?  And in Ithaca, home of
Cornell, which is also high on the list?<br><br>I grew up in Pittsburgh and went to college at Cornell, so I can
answer for both.  The weather is terrible,  particularly in winter,
and there&apos;s no interesting old city to make up for it, as there is
in Boston.  Rich people don&apos;t want to live in Pittsburgh or Ithaca.
So while there are plenty of hackers who could start startups,
there&apos;s no one to invest in them.<br><br><b>Not Bureaucrats</b><br><br>Do you really need the rich people?  Wouldn&apos;t it work to have the
government invest in the nerds?  No, it would not.  Startup investors
are a distinct type of rich people.  They tend to have a lot of
experience themselves in the technology business.  This (a) helps
them pick the right startups, and (b) means they can supply advice
and connections as well as money.  And the fact that they have a
personal stake in the outcome makes them really pay attention.<br><br>Bureaucrats by their nature are the exact opposite sort of people
from startup investors. The idea of them making startup investments
is comic.  It would be like mathematicians running <i>Vogue</i>-- or
perhaps more accurately, <i>Vogue</i> editors running a math journal.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Though indeed, most things bureaucrats do, they do badly.   We just
don&apos;t notice usually, because they only have to compete against
other bureaucrats.  But as startup investors they&apos;d have to compete
against pros with a great deal more experience and motivation.<br><br>Even corporations that have in-house VC groups generally forbid
them to make their own investment decisions.  Most are only allowed
to invest in deals where some reputable private VC firm is willing
to act as lead investor.<br><br><b>Not Buildings</b><br><br>If you go to see Silicon Valley, what you&apos;ll see are buildings.
But it&apos;s the people that make it Silicon Valley, not the buildings.
I read occasionally about attempts to set up &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=technology+park">technology
parks</a>&quot; in other places, as if the active ingredient of Silicon
Valley were the office space.  An article about Sophia Antipolis
bragged that companies there included Cisco, Compaq, IBM, NCR, and
Nortel.  Don&apos;t the French realize these aren&apos;t startups?<br><br>Building office buildings for technology companies won&apos;t get you a
silicon valley, because the key stage in the life of a startup
happens before they want that kind of space.  The key stage is when
they&apos;re three guys operating out of an apartment.  Wherever the
startup is when it gets funded, it will stay.  The defining quality
of Silicon Valley is not that Intel or Apple or Google have offices
there, but that they were <i>started</i> there.<br><br>So if you want to reproduce Silicon Valley, what you need to reproduce
is those two or three founders sitting around a kitchen table
deciding to start a company.  And to reproduce that you need those
people.<br><br><b>Universities</b><br><br>The exciting thing is, <i>all</i> you need are the people.  If you could
attract a critical mass of nerds and investors to live somewhere,
you could reproduce Silicon Valley.  And both groups are highly
mobile.  They&apos;ll go where life is good.  So what makes a place good
to them?<br><br>What nerds like is other nerds.  Smart people will go wherever other
smart people are.  And in particular, to great universities.  In
theory there could be other ways to attract them, but so far
universities seem to be indispensable.  Within the US, there are
no technology hubs without first-rate universities-- or at least,
first-rate computer science departments.<br><br>So if you want to make a silicon valley, you not only need a
university, but one of the top handful in the world.  It has to be
good enough to act as a magnet, drawing the best people from thousands
of miles away.  And that means it has to stand up to existing magnets
like MIT and Stanford.<br><br>This sounds hard.  Actually it might be easy.  My professor friends,
when they&apos;re deciding where they&apos;d like to work, consider one thing
above all: the quality of the other faculty.  What attracts professors
is good colleagues.  So if you managed to recruit, en masse, a
significant number of the best young researchers, you could create
a first-rate university from nothing overnight.  And you could do
that for surprisingly little.  If you paid 200 people hiring bonuses
of $3 million apiece, you could put together a faculty that would
bear comparison with any in the world.  And from that point the
chain reaction would be self-sustaining.  So whatever it costs to
establish a mediocre university, for an additional half billion or
so you could have a great one.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Personality</b><br><br>However, merely creating a new university would not be enough to
start a silicon valley. The university is just the seed.  It has
to be planted in the right soil, or it won&apos;t germinate.  Plant it
in the wrong place, and you just create Carnegie-Mellon.<br><br>To spawn startups, your university has to be in a town that has
attractions other than the university.  It has to be a place where
investors want to live, and students want to stay after they graduate.<br><br>The two like much the same things, because most startup investors
are nerds themselves.  So what do nerds look for in a town?  Their
tastes aren&apos;t completely different from other people&apos;s, because a
lot of the towns they like most in the US are also big tourist
destinations: San Francisco, Boston, Seattle.   But their tastes
can&apos;t be quite mainstream either, because they dislike other big
tourist destinations, like New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.<br><br>There has been a lot written lately about the &quot;creative class.&quot; The
thesis seems to be that as wealth derives increasingly from ideas,
cities will prosper only if they attract those who have them.  That
is certainly true; in fact it was the basis of Amsterdam&apos;s prosperity
400 years ago.<br><br>A lot of nerd tastes they share with the creative class in general.
For example, they like well-preserved old neighborhoods instead of
cookie-cutter suburbs, and locally-owned shops and restaurants
instead of national chains.  Like the rest of the creative class,
they want to live somewhere with personality.<br><br>What exactly is personality?  I think it&apos;s the feeling that each
building is the work of a distinct group of people.  A town with
personality is one that doesn&apos;t feel mass-produced.  So if you want
to make a startup hub-- or any town to attract the &quot;creative class&quot;--
you probably have to ban large development projects.
When a large tract has been developed by a single organization, you
can always tell. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Most towns with personality are old, but they don&apos;t have to be.
Old towns have two advantages: they&apos;re denser, because they were
laid out before cars, and they&apos;re more varied, because they were
built one building at a time.  You could have both now.  Just have
building codes that ensure density, and ban large scale developments.<br><br>A corollary is that you have to keep out the biggest developer of
all: the government.  A government that asks &quot;How can we build a
silicon valley?&quot; has probably ensured failure by the way they framed
the question.  You don&apos;t build a silicon valley; you let one grow.<br><br><b>Nerds</b><br><br>If you want to attract nerds, you need more than a town with
personality.  You need a town with the right personality.  Nerds
are a distinct subset of the creative class, with different tastes
from the rest.  You can see this most clearly in New York, which
attracts a lot of creative people, but few nerds. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>What nerds like is the kind of town where people walk around smiling.
This excludes LA, where no one walks at all, and also New York,
where people walk, but not smiling. When I was in grad school in
Boston, a friend came to visit from New York.  On the subway back
from the airport she asked &quot;Why is everyone smiling?&quot;  I looked and
they weren&apos;t smiling.  They just looked like they were compared to
the facial expressions she was used to.<br><br>If you&apos;ve lived in New York, you know where these facial expressions
come from.  It&apos;s the kind of place where your mind may be excited,
but your body knows it&apos;s having a bad time.  People don&apos;t so much
enjoy living there as endure it for the sake of the excitement.
And if you like certain kinds of excitement, New York is incomparable.
It&apos;s a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the shorter half-life
isotopes of style and fame.<br><br>Nerds don&apos;t care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New York
is a mystery.  People who like New York will pay a fortune for a
small, dark, noisy apartment in order to live in a town where the
cool people are really cool.  A nerd looks at that deal and sees
only: pay a fortune for a small, dark, noisy apartment.<br><br>Nerds <i>will</i> pay a premium to live in a town where the smart people
are really smart, but you don&apos;t have to pay as much for that.  It&apos;s
supply and demand: glamour is popular, so you have to pay a lot for
it.<br><br>Most nerds like quieter pleasures.  They like cafes instead of
clubs; used bookshops instead of fashionable clothing shops; hiking
instead of dancing; sunlight instead of tall buildings.  A nerd&apos;s
idea of paradise is Berkeley or Boulder.<br><br><b>Youth</b><br><br>It&apos;s the young nerds who start startups, so it&apos;s those specifically
the city has to appeal to.  The startup hubs in the US are all
young-feeling towns.  This doesn&apos;t mean they have to be new.
Cambridge has the oldest town plan in America, but it feels young
because it&apos;s full of students.<br><br>What you can&apos;t have, if you want to create a silicon valley, is a
large, existing population of stodgy people.  It would be a waste
of time to try to reverse the fortunes of a declining industrial town
like Detroit or Philadelphia by trying to encourage startups.  Those
places have too much momentum in the wrong direction.  You&apos;re better
off starting with a blank slate in the form of a small town.  Or
better still, if there&apos;s a town young people already flock to, that
one.<br><br>The Bay Area was a magnet for the young and optimistic for decades
before it was associated with technology.  It was a place people
went in search of something new.  And so it became synonymous with
California nuttiness.  There&apos;s still a lot of that there.  If you
wanted to start a new fad-- a new way to focus one&apos;s &quot;energy,&quot; for
example, or a new category of things not to eat-- the Bay Area would
be the place to do it.  But a place that tolerates oddness in the
search for the new is exactly what you want in a startup hub, because
economically that&apos;s what startups are.  Most good startup ideas
seem a little crazy; if they were obviously good ideas, someone
would have done them already.<br><br>(How many people are going to want computers in their <i>houses</i>?
What, <i>another</i> search engine?)<br><br>That&apos;s the connection between technology and liberalism.  Without
exception the high-tech cities in the US are also the most liberal.
But it&apos;s not because liberals are smarter that this is so.  It&apos;s
because liberal cities tolerate odd ideas, and smart people by
definition have odd ideas.<br><br>Conversely, a town that gets praised for being &quot;solid&quot; or representing
&quot;traditional values&quot; may be a fine place to live, but it&apos;s never
going to succeed as a startup hub.  The 2004 presidential election,
though a disaster in other respects, conveniently supplied us with
a county-by-county <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2004/countymaplinearlarge.png">
map</a> of such places.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>To attract the young, a town must have an intact center.  In most
American cities the center has been abandoned, and the growth, if
any, is in the suburbs.  Most American cities have been turned
inside out. But none of the startup hubs has: not San Francisco,
or Boston, or Seattle.  They all have intact centers.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font>
My guess is that no city with a dead center could be turned into a
startup hub.  Young people don&apos;t want to live in the suburbs.<br><br>Within the US, the two cities I think could most easily be turned
into new silicon valleys are Boulder and Portland.  Both have the
kind of effervescent feel that attracts the young.  They&apos;re each
only a great university short of becoming a silicon valley, if they
wanted to.<br><br><b>Time</b><br><br>A great university near an attractive town.  Is that all it takes?
That was all it took to make the original Silicon Valley.  Silicon
Valley traces its origins to William Shockley, one of the inventors
of the transistor.  He did the research that won him the Nobel Prize
at Bell Labs, but when he started his own company in 1956 he moved
to Palo Alto to do it.   At the time that was an odd thing to do.
Why did he?  Because he had grown up there and remembered how nice
it was.  Now Palo Alto is suburbia, but then it was a charming
college town-- a charming college town with perfect weather and San
Francisco only an hour away.<br><br>The companies that rule Silicon Valley now are all descended in
various ways from Shockley Semiconductor.  Shockley was a difficult
man, and in 1957 his top people-- &quot;the traitorous eight&quot;-- left to
start a new company, Fairchild Semiconductor.  Among them were
Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, who went on to found Intel, and
Eugene Kleiner, who founded the VC firm Kleiner Perkins.  Forty-two
years later, Kleiner Perkins funded Google, and the partner responsible
for the deal was John Doerr, who came to Silicon Valley in 1974 to
work for Intel.<br><br>So although a lot of the newest companies in Silicon Valley don&apos;t
make anything out of silicon, there always seem to be multiple links
back to Shockley.  There&apos;s a lesson here: startups beget startups.
People who work for startups start their own.  People who get rich
from startups fund new ones.  I suspect this kind of organic growth
is the only way to produce a startup hub, because it&apos;s the only way
to grow the expertise you need.<br><br>That has two important implications.  The first is that you need
time to grow a silicon valley.  The university you could create in
a couple years, but the startup community around it has to grow
organically.   The cycle time is limited by the time it takes a
company to succeed, which probably averages about five years.<br><br>The other implication of the organic growth hypothesis is that you
can&apos;t be somewhat of a startup hub.  You either have a self-sustaining
chain reaction, or not.  Observation confirms this too: cities
either have a startup scene, or they don&apos;t.  There is no middle
ground.  Chicago has the third largest metropolitan area in America.
As source of startups it&apos;s negligible compared to Seattle, number 15.<br><br>The good news is that the initial seed can be quite small.  Shockley
Semiconductor, though itself not very successful, was big enough.
It brought a critical mass of experts in an important new technology
together in a place they liked enough to stay.<br><br><b>Competing</b><br><br>Of course, a would-be silicon valley faces an obstacle the original
one didn&apos;t: it has to compete with Silicon Valley.  Can that be
done?  Probably.<br><br>One of Silicon Valley&apos;s biggest advantages is its venture capital
firms.  This was not a factor in Shockley&apos;s day, because VC funds
didn&apos;t exist.  In fact, Shockley Semiconductor and Fairchild
Semiconductor were not startups at all in our sense.  They were
subsidiaries-- of Beckman Instruments and Fairchild Camera and
Instrument respectively.  Those companies were apparently willing
to establish subsidiaries wherever the experts wanted to live.<br><br>Venture investors, however, prefer to fund startups within an hour&apos;s
drive.  For one, they&apos;re more likely to notice startups nearby.
But when they do notice startups in other towns they prefer them
to move.  They don&apos;t want to have to travel to attend board meetings,
and in any case the odds of succeeding are higher in a startup hub.<br><br>The centralizing effect of venture firms is a double one: they cause
startups to form around them, and those draw in more startups through
acquisitions.  And although the first may be weakening because it&apos;s
now so cheap to start some startups, the second seems as strong as ever.
Three of the most admired
&quot;Web 2.0&quot; companies were started outside the usual startup hubs,
but two of them have already been reeled in through acquisitions.<br><br>Such centralizing forces make it harder for new silicon valleys to
get started.  But by no means impossible.  Ultimately power rests
with the founders.  A startup with the best people will beat one
with funding from famous VCs, and a startup that was sufficiently
successful would never have to move.  So a town that
could exert enough pull over the right people could resist and
perhaps even surpass Silicon Valley.<br><br>For all its power, Silicon Valley has a great weakness: the paradise
Shockley found in 1956 is now one giant parking lot.  San Francisco
and Berkeley are great, but they&apos;re forty miles away.  Silicon
Valley proper is soul-crushing suburban <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/caterina/34637/">sprawl</a>.  It
has fabulous weather, which makes it significantly better than the
soul-crushing sprawl of most other American cities.  But a competitor
that managed to avoid sprawl would have real leverage.  All a city
needs is to be the kind of place the next traitorous eight look at
and say &quot;I want to stay here,&quot; and that would be enough to get the
chain reaction started.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
It&apos;s interesting to consider how low this number could be
made.  I suspect five hundred would be enough, even if they could
bring no assets with them.  Probably just thirty, if I could pick them, 
would be enough to turn Buffalo into a significant startup hub.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Bureaucrats manage to allocate research funding moderately
well, but only because (like an in-house VC fund) they outsource
most of the work of selection.  A professor at a famous university
who is highly regarded by his peers will get funding, pretty much
regardless of the proposal.  That wouldn&apos;t work for startups, whose
founders aren&apos;t sponsored by organizations, and are often unknowns.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
You&apos;d have to do it all at once, or at least a whole department
at a time, because people would be more likely to come if they
knew their friends were.  And you should probably start from scratch,
rather than trying to upgrade an existing university, or much energy
would be lost in friction.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Hypothesis: Any plan in which multiple independent buildings
are gutted or demolished to be &quot;redeveloped&quot; as a single project
is a net loss of personality for the city, with the exception of
the conversion of buildings not previously public, like warehouses.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
A few startups get started in New York, but less
than a tenth as many per capita as in Boston, and mostly
in less nerdy fields like finance and media.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Some blue counties are false positives (reflecting the
remaining power of Democractic party machines), but there are no

There are a lot of them in Silicon
Valley and Boston, and few in Chicago or Miami.  A country that
wants startups will probably also have to reproduce whatever makes
these clusters form.<br><br>I&apos;ve claimed that the <a href="siliconvalley.html">recipe</a> is a
great university near a town smart
people like.  If you set up those conditions within the US, startups
will form as inevitably as water droplets condense on a cold piece
of metal.  But when I consider what it would take to reproduce
Silicon Valley in another country, it&apos;s clear the US is a particularly
humid environment.  Startups condense more easily here.<br><br>It is by no means a lost cause to try to create a silicon valley
in another country.  There&apos;s room not merely to equal Silicon Valley,
but to surpass it.  But if you want to do that, you have to
understand the advantages startups get from being in America.<br><br><b>1. The US Allows Immigration.</b><br><br>For example, I doubt it would be possible to reproduce Silicon
Valley in Japan, because one of Silicon Valley&apos;s most distinctive
features is immigration.  Half the people there speak with accents.
And the Japanese don&apos;t like immigration.  When they think about how
to make a Japanese silicon valley, I suspect they unconsciously
frame it as how to make one consisting only of Japanese people.
This way of framing the question probably guarantees failure.<br><br>A silicon valley has to be a mecca for the smart and the ambitious,
and you can&apos;t have a mecca if you don&apos;t let people into it.<br><br>Of course, it&apos;s not saying much that America is more open to
immigration than Japan.  Immigration policy is one area where a
competitor could do better.<br><br><b>2. The US Is a Rich Country.</b><br><br>I could see India one day producing a rival to Silicon Valley.
Obviously they have the right people: you can tell that by the
number of Indians in the current Silicon Valley.  The problem with
India itself is that it&apos;s still so poor.<br><br>In poor countries, things we take for granted are missing.  A friend
of mine visiting India sprained her ankle falling down the steps
in a railway station.  When she turned to see what had happened,
she found the steps were all different heights.  In industrialized
countries we walk down steps our whole lives and never think about
this, because there&apos;s an infrastructure that prevents such a staircase
from being built.<br><br>The US has never been so poor as some countries are now.  There
have never been swarms of beggars in the streets of American cities.
So we have no data about what it takes to get from the swarms-of-beggars
stage to the silicon-valley stage.  Could you have both at once,
or does there have to be some baseline prosperity before you get a
silicon valley?<br><br>I suspect there is some speed limit to the evolution
of an economy.  Economies are made out of people, and attitudes can
only change a certain amount per generation.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>3. The US Is Not (Yet) a Police State.</b><br><br>Another country I could see wanting to have a silicon valley is
China.  But I doubt they could do it yet either.  China still seems
to be a police state, and although present rulers seem enlightened
compared to the last, even enlightened despotism can probably only
get you part way toward being a great economic power.<br><br>It can get you factories for building things designed elsewhere.
Can it get you the designers, though?  Can imagination flourish
where people can&apos;t criticize the government?  Imagination means
having odd ideas, and it&apos;s hard to have odd ideas about technology
without also having odd ideas about politics.  And in any case,
many technical ideas do have political implications.  So if you
squash dissent, the back pressure will propagate into technical
fields. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Singapore would face a similar problem.  Singapore seems very aware
of the importance of encouraging startups.  But while energetic
government intervention may be able to make a port run efficiently,
it can&apos;t coax startups into existence.  A state that bans chewing
gum has a long way to go before it could create a San Francisco.<br><br>Do you need a San Francisco?  Might there not be an alternate route
to innovation that goes through obedience and cooperation instead
of individualism?  Possibly, but I&apos;d bet not.  Most imaginative
people seem to share a certain prickly <a href="gba.html">independence</a>,
whenever and wherever they lived.  You see it in Diogenes telling
Alexander to get out of his light and two thousand years later in
Feynman breaking into safes at Los Alamos.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
Imaginative people
don&apos;t want to follow or lead.  They&apos;re most productive when everyone
gets to do what they want.<br><br>Ironically, of all rich countries the US has lost the most civil
liberties recently.  But I&apos;m not too worried yet.  I&apos;m hoping once
the present administration is out, the natural openness of American
culture will reassert itself.<br><br><b>4. American Universities Are Better.</b><br><br>You need a great university to seed a silicon valley, and so far
there are few outside the US.  I asked a handful of American computer
science professors which universities in Europe were most admired,
and they all basically said &quot;Cambridge&quot; followed by a long pause
while they tried to think of others.  There don&apos;t seem to be many
universities elsewhere that compare with the best in America, at
least in technology.<br><br>In some countries this is the result of a deliberate policy.  The
German and Dutch governments, perhaps from fear of elitism, try to
ensure that all universities are roughly equal in quality.  The
downside is that none are especially good.   The best professors
are spread out, instead of being concentrated as they are in the
US.  This probably makes them less productive, because they don&apos;t
have good colleagues to inspire them.  It also means no one university
will be good enough to act as a mecca, attracting talent from abroad
and causing startups to form around it.<br><br>The case of Germany is a strange one.  The Germans invented the
modern university, and up till the 1930s theirs were the best in
the world.  Now they have none that stand out.  As I was mulling
this over, I found myself thinking: &quot;I can understand why German
universities declined in the 1930s, after they excluded Jews.  But
surely they should have bounced back by now.&quot;  Then I realized:
maybe not.  There are few Jews left in Germany and most Jews I know
would not want to move there.  And if you took any great American
university and removed the Jews, you&apos;d have some pretty big gaps.
So maybe it would be a lost cause trying to create a silicon valley
in Germany, because you couldn&apos;t establish the level of university
you&apos;d need as a seed.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>It&apos;s natural for US universities to compete with one another because
so many are private.  To reproduce the quality of American universities
you probably also have to reproduce this.  If universities are
controlled by the central government, log-rolling will pull them
all toward the mean: the new Institute of X will end up at the
university in the district of a powerful politician, instead of
where it should be.<br><br><b>5. You Can Fire People in America.</b><br><br>I think one of the biggest obstacles to creating startups in Europe
is the attitude toward employment.  The famously rigid labor laws
hurt every company, but startups especially, because startups have
the least time to spare for bureaucratic hassles.<br><br>The difficulty of firing people is a particular problem for startups
because they have no redundancy.  Every person has to do their
job well.<br><br>But the problem is more than just that some startup might have a
problem firing someone they needed to.  Across industries and
countries, there&apos;s a strong inverse correlation between performance
and job security.  Actors and directors are fired at the end of
each film, so they have to deliver every time.  Junior professors
are fired by default after a few years unless the university chooses
to grant them tenure.  Professional athletes know they&apos;ll be pulled
if they play badly for just a couple games.  At the other end of
the scale (at least in the US) are auto workers, New York City
schoolteachers, and civil servants, who are all nearly impossible
to fire.  The trend is so clear that you&apos;d have to be willfully
blind not to see it.<br><br>Performance isn&apos;t everything, you say?  Well, are auto workers,
schoolteachers, and civil servants <i>happier</i> than actors,
professors, and professional athletes?<br><br>European public opinion will apparently tolerate people being fired
in industries where they really care about performance.  Unfortunately
the only industry they care enough about so far is soccer.  But
that is at least a precedent.<br><br><b>6. In America Work Is Less Identified with Employment.</b><br><br>The problem in more traditional places like Europe and Japan goes
deeper than the employment laws.  More dangerous is the attitude
they reflect: that an employee is a kind of servant, whom the
employer has a duty to protect.  It used to be that way in America
too.  In 1970 you were still supposed to get a job with a big
company, for whom ideally you&apos;d work your whole career.  In return
the company would take care of you: they&apos;d try not to fire you,
cover your medical expenses, and support you in old age.<br><br>Gradually employment has been shedding such paternalistic overtones
and becoming simply an economic exchange.  But the importance of
the new model is not just that it makes it easier for startups to
grow.  More important, I think, is that it it makes it easier for
people to <i>start</i> startups.<br><br>Even in the US most kids graduating from college still think they&apos;re
supposed to get jobs, as if you couldn&apos;t be productive without being
someone&apos;s employee.  But the less you identify work with employment,
the easier it becomes to start a startup.  When you see your career
as a series of different types of work, instead of a lifetime&apos;s
service to a single employer, there&apos;s less risk in starting your
own company, because you&apos;re only replacing one segment instead of
discarding the whole thing.<br><br>The old ideas are so powerful that even the most successful startup
founders have had to struggle against them.  A year after the
founding of Apple, Steve Wozniak still hadn&apos;t quit HP.  He still
planned to work there for life.  And when Jobs found someone to
give Apple serious venture funding, on the condition that Woz quit,
he initially refused, arguing that he&apos;d designed both the Apple I
and the Apple II while working at HP, and there was no reason he
couldn&apos;t continue.<br><br><b>7.  America Is Not Too Fussy.</b><br><br>If there are any laws regulating businesses, you can assume larval
startups will break most of them, because they don&apos;t know what the
laws are and don&apos;t have time to find out.<br><br>For example, many startups in America begin in places where it&apos;s
not really legal to run a business.  Hewlett-Packard, Apple, and
Google were all run out of garages.  Many more startups, including
ours, were initially run out of apartments.  If the laws against
such things were actually enforced, most startups wouldn&apos;t happen.<br><br>That could be a problem in fussier countries.  If Hewlett and Packard
tried running an electronics company out of their garage in
Switzerland, the old lady next door would report them to the municipal
authorities.<br><br>But the worst problem in other countries is probably the effort
required just to start a company.  A friend of mine started a company
in Germany in the early 90s, and was shocked to discover, among
many other regulations, that you needed $20,000 in capital to
incorporate.  That&apos;s one reason I&apos;m not typing this on an Apfel
laptop.  Jobs and Wozniak couldn&apos;t have come up with that kind of
money in a company financed by selling a VW bus and an HP calculator.
We couldn&apos;t have started Viaweb either.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Here&apos;s a tip for governments that want to encourage startups: read
the stories of existing startups, and then try to simulate what
would have happened in your country.  When you hit something that
would have killed Apple, prune it off.<br><br><i>Startups are <a href="marginal.html">marginal</a>.</i>  
They&apos;re started by the poor and the
timid; they begin in marginal space and spare time; they&apos;re started
by people who are supposed to be doing something else; and though
businesses, their founders often know nothing about business.  Young
startups are fragile.  A society that trims its margins sharply
will kill them all.<br><br><b>8. America Has a Large Domestic Market.</b><br><br>What sustains a startup in the beginning is the prospect of getting
their initial product out.  The successful ones therefore make the
first version as simple as possible.  In the US they usually begin
by making something just for the local market.<br><br>This works in America, because the local market is 300 million
people.  It wouldn&apos;t work so well in Sweden.  In a small country,
a startup has a harder task: they have to sell internationally from
the start.<br><br>The EU was designed partly to simulate a single, large domestic
market.  The problem is that the inhabitants still speak many
different languages.  So a software startup in Sweden is still at
a disadvantage relative to one in the US, because they have to deal
with internationalization from the beginning.  It&apos;s significant
that the most famous recent startup in Europe, Skype, worked on a
problem that was intrinsically international.<br><br>However, for better or worse it looks as if Europe will in a few
decades speak a single language.  When I was a student in Italy in
1990, few Italians spoke English.  Now all educated people seem to
be expected to-- and Europeans do not like to seem uneducated.  This
is presumably a taboo subject, but if present trends continue,
French and German will eventually go the way of Irish and Luxembourgish:
they&apos;ll be spoken in homes and by eccentric nationalists.<br><br><b>9. America Has Venture Funding.</b><br><br>Startups are easier to start in America because funding is easier
to get.  There are now a few VC firms outside the US, but startup
funding doesn&apos;t only come from VC firms.  A more important source,
because it&apos;s more personal and comes earlier in the process, is
money from individual angel investors.  Google might never have got
to the point where they could raise millions from VC funds if they
hadn&apos;t first raised a hundred thousand from Andy Bechtolsheim.  And
he could help them because he was one of the founders of Sun.  This
pattern is repeated constantly in startup hubs.  It&apos;s this pattern
that <i>makes</i> them startup hubs.<br><br>The good news is, all you have to do to get the process rolling is
get those first few startups successfully launched.  If they stick
around after they get rich, startup founders will almost automatically
fund and encourage new startups.<br><br>The bad news is that the cycle is slow.  It probably takes five
years, on average, before a startup founder can make angel investments.
And while governments <i>might</i> be able to set up local VC funds
by supplying the money themselves and recruiting people from existing
firms to run them, only organic growth can produce angel investors.<br><br>Incidentally, America&apos;s private universities are one reason there&apos;s
so much venture capital.  A lot of the money in VC funds comes from
their endowments.  So another advantage of private universities is
that a good chunk of the country&apos;s wealth is managed by enlightened
investors.<br><br><b>10. America Has Dynamic Typing for Careers.</b><br><br>Compared to other industrialized countries the US is disorganized
about routing people into careers.  For example, in America people
often don&apos;t decide to go to medical school till they&apos;ve finished
college.  In Europe they generally decide in high school.<br><br>The European approach reflects the old idea that each person has a
single, definite occupation-- which is not far from the idea that
each person has a natural &quot;station&quot; in life.  If this were true,
the most efficient plan would be to discover each person&apos;s station
as early as possible, so they could receive the training appropriate
to it.<br><br>In the US things are more haphazard.  But that turns out to be an
advantage as an economy gets more liquid, just as dynamic typing
turns out to work better than static for ill-defined problems.  This
is particularly true with startups.  &quot;Startup founder&quot; is not the
sort of career a high school student would choose.  If you ask at
that age, people will choose conservatively.  They&apos;ll choose
well-understood occupations like engineer, or doctor, or lawyer.<br><br>Startups are the kind of thing people don&apos;t plan, so you&apos;re more
likely to get them in a society where it&apos;s ok to make career decisions
on the fly.<br><br>For example, in theory the purpose of a PhD program is to train you
to do research.  But fortunately in the US this is another rule
that isn&apos;t very strictly enforced.  In the US most people in CS PhD
programs are there simply because they wanted to learn more.  They
haven&apos;t decided what they&apos;ll do afterward.  So American grad schools
spawn a lot of startups, because students don&apos;t feel they&apos;re failing
if they don&apos;t go into research.<br><br>Those worried about America&apos;s &quot;competitiveness&quot; often suggest
spending more on public schools.  But perhaps America&apos;s lousy public
schools have a hidden advantage.  Because they&apos;re so bad, the kids
adopt an attitude of waiting for college.  I did; I knew I was
learning so little that I wasn&apos;t even learning what the choices
were, let alone which to choose.  This is demoralizing, but it does
at least make you keep an open mind.<br><br>Certainly if I had to choose between bad high schools and good
universities, like the US, and good high schools and bad universities,
like most other industrialized countries, I&apos;d take the US system.
Better to make everyone feel like a late bloomer than a failed child
prodigy.<br><br><b>Attitudes</b><br><br>There&apos;s one item conspicuously missing from this list: American
attitudes.  Americans are said to be more entrepreneurial, and less
afraid of risk.  But America has no monopoly on this.  Indians and
Chinese seem plenty entrepreneurial, perhaps more than Americans.<br><br>Some say Europeans are less energetic, but I don&apos;t believe it.  I
think the problem with Europe is not that they lack balls, but that
they lack examples.<br><br>Even in the US, the most successful startup founders are often
technical people who are quite timid, initially, about the idea of
starting their own company. Few are the sort of backslapping
extroverts one thinks of as typically American.  They can usually
only summon up the activation energy to start a startup when they
meet people who&apos;ve done it and realize they could too.<br><br>I think what holds back European hackers is simply that they don&apos;t
meet so many people who&apos;ve done it. You see that variation even
within the US.  Stanford students are more entrepreneurial than
Yale students, but not because of some difference in their characters;
the Yale students just have fewer examples.<br><br>I admit there seem to be different attitudes toward ambition in
Europe and the US.  In the US it&apos;s ok to be overtly ambitious, and
in most of Europe it&apos;s not.  But this can&apos;t be an intrinsically
European quality; previous generations of Europeans were as ambitious
as Americans.  What happened?  My hypothesis is that ambition was
discredited by the terrible things ambitious people did in the first
half of the twentieth century.  Now swagger is out. (Even now the
image of a very ambitious German presses a button or two, doesn&apos;t
it?)<br><br>It would be surprising if European attitudes weren&apos;t affected by
the disasters of the twentieth century.  It takes a while to be
optimistic after events like that.  But ambition is human nature.
Gradually it will re-emerge.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>How To Do Better</b><br><br>I don&apos;t mean to suggest by this list that America is the perfect
place for startups.  It&apos;s the best place so far, but the sample
size is small, and &quot;so far&quot; is not very long.   On historical time 
scales, what we have now is just a
prototype.<br><br>So let&apos;s look at Silicon Valley the way you&apos;d look at a product
made by a competitor.  What weaknesses could you exploit?  How could
you make something users would like better?  The users in this case
are those critical few thousand people you&apos;d like to move to your
silicon valley.<br><br>To start with, Silicon Valley is too far from San Francisco.  Palo
Alto, the original ground zero, is about thirty miles away, and the
present center more like forty.  So people who come to work in
Silicon Valley face an unpleasant choice: either live in the boring
sprawl of the valley proper, or live in San Francisco and endure
an hour commute each way.<br><br>The best thing would be if the silicon valley were not merely closer
to the interesting city, but interesting itself.  And there is a
lot of room for improvement here.  Palo Alto is not so bad, but
everything built since is the worst sort of strip development.  You
can measure how demoralizing it is by the number of people who will
sacrifice two hours a day commuting rather than live there.<br><br>Another area in which you could easily surpass Silicon Valley is
public transportation.  There is a train running the length of it,
and by American standards it&apos;s not bad.  Which is to say that to
Japanese or Europeans it would seem like something out of the third
world.<br><br>The kind of people you want to attract to your silicon valley like
to get around by train, bicycle, and on foot.  So if you want to
beat America, design a town that puts cars last.  It will be a while
before any American city can bring itself to do that.<br><br><b>Capital Gains</b><br><br>There are also a couple things you could do to beat America at the
national level.  One would be to have lower capital gains taxes.
It doesn&apos;t seem critical to have the lowest <i>income</i> taxes,
because to take advantage of those, people have to move.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font>
But
if capital gains rates vary, you move assets, not yourself, so
changes are reflected at market speeds.  The lower the rate, the
cheaper it is to buy stock in growing companies as opposed to real
estate, or bonds, or stocks bought for the dividends they pay.<br><br>So if you want to encourage startups you should have a low rate on
capital gains.  Politicians are caught between a rock and a hard
place here, however: make the capital gains rate low and be accused
of creating &quot;tax breaks for the rich,&quot; or make it high and starve
growing companies of investment capital.   As Galbraith said,
politics is a matter of choosing between the unpalatable and the
disastrous.  A lot of governments experimented with the disastrous
in the twentieth century; now the trend seems to be toward the
merely unpalatable.<br><br>Oddly enough, the leaders now are European countries like Belgium,
which has a capital gains tax rate of zero.<br><br><b>Immigration</b><br><br>The other place you could beat the US would be with smarter immigration
policy.  There are huge gains to be made here.  Silicon valleys are
made of people, remember.<br><br>Like a company whose software runs on Windows, those in the current
Silicon Valley are all too aware of the shortcomings of the INS,
but there&apos;s little they can do about it.  They&apos;re hostages of the
platform.<br><br>America&apos;s immigration system has never been well run, and since
2001 there has been an additional admixture of paranoia.  What
fraction of the smart people who want to come to America can even
get in?  I doubt even half.  Which means if you made a competing
technology hub that let in all smart people, you&apos;d immediately get
more than half the world&apos;s top talent, for free.<br><br>US immigration policy is particularly ill-suited to startups, because
it reflects a model of work from the 1970s.  It assumes good technical
people have college degrees, and that work means working for a big
company.<br><br>If you don&apos;t have a college degree you can&apos;t get an H1B visa, the
type usually issued to programmers.  But a test that excludes Steve
Jobs, Bill Gates, and Michael Dell can&apos;t be a good one.  Plus you
can&apos;t get a visa for working on your own company, only for working
as an employee of someone else&apos;s.  And if you want to apply for
citizenship you daren&apos;t work for a startup at all, because if your
sponsor goes out of business, you have to start over.<br><br>American immigration policy keeps out most smart people, and channels
the rest into unproductive jobs.  It would be easy to do better.
Imagine if, instead, you treated immigration like recruiting-- if
you made a conscious effort to seek out the smartest people and get
them to come to your country.<br><br>A country that got immigration right would have a huge advantage.
At this point you could become a mecca for smart people simply by
having an immigration system that let them in.<br><br><b>A Good Vector</b><br><br>If you look at the kinds of things you have to do to create an
environment where startups condense, none are great sacrifices.
Great universities?  Livable towns?  Civil liberties?  Flexible
employment laws?  Immigration policies that let in smart people?
Tax laws that encourage growth?  It&apos;s not as if you have to risk
destroying your country to get a silicon valley; these are all good
things in their own right.<br><br>And then of course there&apos;s the question, can you afford not to?  I
can imagine a future in which the default choice of ambitious young
people is to start their <a href="hiring.html">own</a> company
rather than work for someone else&apos;s.  I&apos;m not sure that will happen,
but it&apos;s where the trend points now.  And if that is the future,
places that don&apos;t have startups will be a whole step behind,
like those that missed the Industrial Revolution.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
On the verge of the Industrial Revolution, England was already
the richest country in the world.  As far as such things can be
compared, per capita income in England in 1750 was higher than
India&apos;s in 1960.<br><br>Deane, Phyllis, <i>The First Industrial Revolution</i>, Cambridge
University Press, 1965.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
 This has already happened once in China, during the Ming
Dynasty, when the country turned its back on industrialization at
the command of the court.  One of Europe&apos;s advantages was that it
had no government powerful enough to do that.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Of course, Feynman and Diogenes were from adjacent traditions,
but Confucius, though more polite, was no more willing to be told
what to think.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
For similar reasons it might be a lost cause to try to establish
a silicon valley in Israel.  Instead of no Jews moving there, only
Jews would move there, and I don&apos;t think you could build a silicon
valley out of just Jews any more than you could out of just Japanese.<br><br>(This is not a remark about the qualities of these groups, just their
sizes.  Japanese are only about 2% of the world population, and
Jews about .2%.)<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
According to the World Bank, the initial capital requirement
for German companies is 47.6% of the per capita income.  Doh.<br><br>World Bank, <i>Doing Business in 2006</i>, http://doingbusiness.org<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
For most of the twentieth century, Europeans looked back on
the summer of 1914 as if they&apos;d been living in a dream world.  It
seems more accurate (or at least, as accurate) to call the years
after 1914 a nightmare than to call those before a dream.  A lot
of the optimism Europeans consider distinctly American is simply
what they too were feeling in 1914.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
The point where things start to go wrong seems to be about
50%.  Above that people get serious about tax avoidance.  The reason
is that the payoff for avoiding tax grows hyperexponentially (x/1-x
for 0 &lt; x &lt; 1).  If your income tax rate is 10%, moving to Monaco
would only give you 11% more income, which wouldn&apos;t even cover the
extra cost.  If it&apos;s 90%, you&apos;d get ten times as much income.  And
at 98%, as it was briefly in Britain in the 70s, moving to Monaco
would give you fifty times as much income.  It seems quite likely
that European governments of the 70s never drew this curve.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Matthias Felleisen, Jessica

<p>
June 2006<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from talks at Usenix 2006 and
Railsconf 2006.)</i><br><br>A couple years ago my friend Trevor and I went to look at the Apple
garage.  As we stood there, he said that as a kid growing up in
Saskatchewan he&apos;d been amazed at the dedication Jobs and Wozniak
must have had to work in a garage.  &quot;Those guys must have been
freezing!&quot;<br><br>That&apos;s one of California&apos;s hidden advantages: the mild climate means
there&apos;s lots of marginal space.  In cold places that margin gets
trimmed off.  There&apos;s a sharper line between outside and inside,
and only projects that are officially sanctioned&#x2014;by organizations,
or parents, or wives, or at least by oneself&#x2014;get proper indoor
space.  That raises the activation energy for new ideas.  You can&apos;t
just tinker. You have to justify.<br><br>Some of Silicon Valley&apos;s most famous companies began in garages:
Hewlett-Packard in 1938, Apple in 1976, Google in 1998.  In Apple&apos;s
case the garage story is a bit of an urban legend.  Woz says all
they did there was assemble some computers, and that he did all the
actual design of the Apple I and Apple II in his apartment or his
cube at HP.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font>
This was apparently too marginal even for Apple&apos;s PR
people.<br><br>By conventional standards, Jobs and Wozniak were marginal people
too.  Obviously they were smart, but they can&apos;t have looked good
on paper.  They were at the time a pair of college dropouts with
about three years of school between them, and hippies to boot.
Their previous business experience consisted of making &quot;blue boxes&quot;
to hack into the phone system, a business with the rare distinction
of being both illegal and unprofitable.<br><br><b>Outsiders</b><br><br>Now a startup operating out of a garage in Silicon Valley would
feel part of an exalted tradition, like the poet in his garret, or
the painter who can&apos;t afford to heat his studio and thus has to
wear a beret indoors.  But in 1976 it didn&apos;t seem so cool.  The
world hadn&apos;t yet realized that starting a computer company was in
the same category as being a writer or a painter. It hadn&apos;t been
for long.  Only in the preceding couple years had the dramatic fall
in the cost of hardware allowed outsiders to compete.<br><br>In 1976, everyone looked down on a company operating out of a garage,
including the founders.  One of the first things Jobs did when they
got some money was to rent office space.  He wanted Apple to seem
like a real company.<br><br>They already had something few real companies ever have: a fabulously well
designed product.  You&apos;d think they&apos;d have had more confidence.
But I&apos;ve talked to a lot of startup founders, and it&apos;s always this
way.  They&apos;ve built something that&apos;s going to change the world, and
they&apos;re worried about some nit like not having proper business
cards.<br><br>That&apos;s the paradox I want to explore: great new things often come
from the margins, and yet the people who discover them are looked
down on by everyone, including themselves.<br><br>It&apos;s an old idea that new things come from the margins. I want to
examine its internal structure.  Why do great ideas come from the
margins?  What kind of ideas?  And is there anything we can do to
encourage the process?<br><br><b>Insiders</b><br><br>One reason so many good ideas come from the margin is simply that
there&apos;s so much of it. There have to be more outsiders than insiders,
if insider means anything.  If the number of outsiders is huge it
will always seem as if a lot of ideas come from them, even if few
do per capita.  But I think there&apos;s more going on than this.  There
are real disadvantages to being an insider, and in some kinds of
work they can outweigh the advantages.<br><br>Imagine, for example, what would happen if the government decided
to commission someone to write an official Great American Novel.
First there&apos;d be a huge ideological squabble over who to choose.
Most of the best writers would be excluded for having offended one
side or the other.  Of the remainder, the smart ones would refuse
such a job, leaving only a few with the wrong sort of ambition.
The committee would choose one at the height of his career&#x2014;that
is, someone whose best work was behind him&#x2014;and hand over the
project with copious free advice about how the book should show in
positive terms the strength and diversity of the American people,
etc, etc.<br><br>The unfortunate writer would then sit down to work with a huge
weight of expectation on his shoulders.  Not wanting to blow such
a public commission, he&apos;d play it safe.  This book had better command
respect, and the way to ensure that would be to make it a tragedy.
Audiences have to be enticed to laugh, but if you kill people they
feel obliged to take you seriously.  As everyone knows, America
plus tragedy equals the Civil War, so that&apos;s what it would have to
be about.  Better stick to the standard cartoon version that the
Civil War was about slavery; people would be confused otherwise;
plus you can show a lot of strength and diversity.  When finally
completed twelve years later, the book would be a 900-page pastiche
of existing popular novels&#x2014;roughly <i>Gone with the Wind</i> plus
<i>Roots</i>.  But its bulk and celebrity would make it a bestseller
for a few months, until blown out of the water by a talk-show host&apos;s
autobiography.  The book would be made into a movie and thereupon
forgotten, except by the more waspish sort of reviewers, among whom
it would be a byword for bogusness like Milli Vanilli or Battlefield
Earth.<br><br>Maybe I got a little carried away with this example.  And yet is
this not at each point the way such a project would play out?  The
government knows better than to get into the novel business, but
in other fields where they have a natural monopoly, like nuclear
waste dumps, aircraft carriers, and regime change, you&apos;d find plenty
of projects isomorphic to this one&#x2014;and indeed, plenty that were
less successful.<br><br>This little thought experiment suggests a few of the disadvantages
of insider projects: the selection of the wrong kind of people, the
excessive scope, the inability to take risks, the need to seem
serious, the weight of expectations, the power of vested interests,
the undiscerning audience, and perhaps most dangerous, the tendency
of such work to become a duty rather than a pleasure.<br><br><b>Tests</b><br><br>A world with outsiders and insiders implies some kind of test for
distinguishing between them.  And the trouble with most tests for
selecting elites is that there are two ways to pass them: to be
good at what they try to measure, and to be good at hacking the
test itself.<br><br>So the first question to ask about a field is how honest its tests
are, because this tells you what it means to be an outsider.  This
tells you how much to trust your instincts when you disagree with
authorities, whether it&apos;s worth going through the usual channels
to become one yourself, and perhaps whether you want to work in
this field at all.<br><br>Tests are least hackable when there are consistent standards for
quality, and the people running the test really care about its
integrity.  Admissions to PhD programs in the hard sciences are
fairly honest, for example.  The professors will get whoever they
admit as their own grad students, so they try hard to choose well,
and they have a fair amount of data to go on.  Whereas undergraduate
admissions seem to be much more hackable.<br><br>One way to tell whether a field has consistent standards is the
overlap between the leading practitioners and the people who teach
the subject in universities.  At one end of the scale you have
fields like math and physics, where nearly all the teachers are
among the best practitioners.  In the middle are medicine, law,
history, architecture, and computer science, where many are.  At
the bottom are business, literature, and the visual arts, where
there&apos;s almost no overlap between the teachers and the leading
practitioners.  It&apos;s this end that gives rise to phrases like &quot;those
who can&apos;t do, teach.&quot;<br><br>Incidentally, this scale might be helpful in deciding what to study
in college.  When I was in college the rule seemed to be that you
should study whatever you were most interested in.  But in retrospect
you&apos;re probably better off studying something moderately interesting
with someone who&apos;s good at it than something very interesting with
someone who isn&apos;t.  You often hear people say that you shouldn&apos;t
major in business in college, but this is actually an instance of
a more general rule: don&apos;t learn things from teachers who are bad
at them.<br><br>How much you should worry about being an outsider depends on the
quality of the insiders.  If you&apos;re an amateur mathematician and
think you&apos;ve solved a famous open problem, better go back and check.
When I was in grad school, a friend in the math department had the
job of replying to people who sent in proofs of Fermat&apos;s last theorem
and so on, and it did not seem as if he saw it as a valuable source
of tips&#x2014;more like manning a mental health hotline.  Whereas if
the stuff you&apos;re writing seems different from what English professors
are interested in, that&apos;s not necessarily a problem.<br><br><b>Anti-Tests</b><br><br>Where the method of selecting the elite is thoroughly corrupt, most
of the good people will be outsiders.  In art, for example, the
image of the poor, misunderstood genius is not just one possible
image of a great artist: it&apos;s the <i>standard</i> image.  I&apos;m not
saying it&apos;s correct, incidentally, but it is telling how well this
image has stuck.  You couldn&apos;t make a rap like that stick to math
or medicine.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>If it&apos;s corrupt enough, a test becomes an anti-test, filtering out
the people it should select by making them to do things only the
wrong people would do.  <a href="nerds.html">Popularity</a> in high school
seems to be such a test.  There are plenty of similar ones in the grownup
world.  For example, rising up through the hierarchy of the average
big company demands an attention to politics few thoughtful people
could spare.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
Someone like Bill Gates can grow a company under
him, but it&apos;s hard to imagine him having the patience to climb the
corporate ladder at General Electric&#x2014;or Microsoft, actually.<br><br>It&apos;s kind of strange when you think about it, because lord-of-the-flies
schools and bureaucratic companies are both the default.  There are
probably a lot of people who go from one to the other and never
realize the whole world doesn&apos;t work this way.<br><br>I think that&apos;s one reason big companies are so often blindsided by
startups.  
People at big companies don&apos;t realize the extent to which
they live in an environment that is one large, ongoing test for the
wrong qualities.<br><br>If you&apos;re an outsider, your best chances for beating insiders are
obviously in fields where corrupt tests select a lame elite.  But
there&apos;s a catch: if the tests are corrupt, your victory won&apos;t be
recognized, at least in your lifetime.  You may feel you don&apos;t need
that, but history suggests it&apos;s dangerous to work in fields with
corrupt tests.  You may beat the insiders, and yet not do as good
work, on an absolute scale, as you would in a field that was more
honest.<br><br>Standards in art, for example, were almost as corrupt in the first
half of the eighteenth century as they are today.  This was the era
of those fluffy idealized portraits of countesses with their lapdogs.
<a href="largilliere-chardin.html">Chardin</a> 
decided to skip all that and paint ordinary things as he
saw them.  He&apos;s now considered the best of that period&#x2014;and yet
not the equal of Leonardo or Bellini or Memling, who all had the
additional encouragement of honest standards.<br><br>It can be worth participating in a corrupt contest, however, if
it&apos;s followed by another that isn&apos;t corrupt.  For example, it would
be worth competing with a company that can spend more than you on
marketing, as long as you can survive to the next round, when
customers compare your actual products.  Similarly, you shouldn&apos;t
be discouraged by the comparatively corrupt test of college admissions,
because it&apos;s followed immediately by less hackable tests.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Risk</b><br><br>Even in a field with honest tests, there are still advantages to
being an outsider.  The most obvious is that outsiders have nothing
to lose.  They can do risky things, and if they fail, so what?  Few
will even notice.<br><br>The eminent, on the other hand, are weighed down by their eminence.
Eminence is like a suit: it impresses the wrong people, and it
constrains the wearer.<br><br>Outsiders should realize the advantage they have here.  Being able
to take risks is hugely valuable.  Everyone values safety too much,
both the obscure and the eminent.  No one wants to look like a fool.
But it&apos;s very useful to be able to.  If most of your ideas aren&apos;t
stupid, you&apos;re probably being too conservative.  You&apos;re not bracketing
the problem.<br><br>Lord Acton said we should judge talent at its best and character
at its worst.  For example, if you write one great book and ten bad
ones, you still count as a great writer&#x2014;or at least, a better
writer than someone who wrote eleven that were merely good.  Whereas
if you&apos;re a quiet, law-abiding citizen most of the time but
occasionally cut someone up and bury them in your backyard, you&apos;re
a bad guy.<br><br>Almost everyone makes the mistake of treating ideas as if they were
indications of character rather than talent&#x2014;as if having a stupid
idea made you stupid.   There&apos;s a huge weight of tradition advising
us to play it safe.  &quot;Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps
silent,&quot; says the Old Testament (Proverbs 17:28).<br><br>Well, that may be fine advice for a bunch of goatherds in Bronze
Age Palestine.  There conservatism would be the order of the day.
But times have changed.  It might still be reasonable to stick with
the Old Testament in political questions, but materially the world
now has a lot more state.  Tradition is less of a guide, not just
because things change faster, but because the space of possibilities
is so large.   The more complicated the world gets, the more valuable
it is to be willing to look like a fool.<br><br><b>Delegation</b><br><br>And yet the more successful people become, the more heat they get
if they screw up&#x2014;or even seem to screw up.  In this respect, as
in many others, the eminent are prisoners of their own success.  So
the best way to understand the advantages of being an outsider may
be to look at the disadvantages of being an insider.<br><br>If you ask eminent people what&apos;s wrong with their lives, the first
thing they&apos;ll complain about is the lack of time.  A friend of mine
at Google is fairly high up in the company and went to work for
them long before they went public.  In other words, he&apos;s now rich
enough not to have to work.  I asked him if he could still endure
the annoyances of having a job, now that he didn&apos;t have to.  And
he said that there weren&apos;t really any annoyances, except&#x2014;and he
got a wistful look when he said this&#x2014;that he got <i>so much
email</i>.<br><br>The eminent feel like everyone wants to take a bite out of them.
The problem is so widespread that people pretending to be eminent
do it by pretending to be overstretched.<br><br>The lives of the eminent become scheduled, and that&apos;s not good for
thinking.  One of the great advantages of being an outsider is long,
uninterrupted blocks of time.  That&apos;s what I remember about grad
school: apparently endless supplies of time, which I spent worrying
about, but not writing, my dissertation.  Obscurity is like health
food&#x2014;unpleasant, perhaps, but good for you.  Whereas fame tends
to be like the alcohol produced by fermentation. When it reaches
a certain concentration, it kills off the yeast that produced it.<br><br>The eminent generally respond to the shortage of time by turning
into managers.  They don&apos;t have time to work.  They&apos;re surrounded
by junior people they&apos;re supposed to help or supervise.  The obvious
solution is to have the junior people do the work.  Some good
stuff happens this way, but there are problems it doesn&apos;t work so
well for: the kind where it helps to have everything in one head.<br><br>For example, it recently emerged that the famous glass artist Dale
Chihuly hasn&apos;t actually blown glass for 27 years.  He has assistants
do the work for him.  But one of the most valuable sources of ideas
in the visual arts is the resistance of the medium.  That&apos;s why oil
paintings look so different from watercolors.  In principle you
could make any mark in any medium; in practice the medium steers
you.  And if you&apos;re no longer doing the work yourself, you stop
learning from this.<br><br>So if you want to beat those eminent enough to delegate, one way
to do it is to take advantage of direct contact with the medium.
In the arts it&apos;s obvious how: blow your own glass, edit your own
films, stage your own plays.  And in the process pay close attention
to accidents and to new ideas you have on the fly.  This technique
can be generalized to any sort of work: if you&apos;re an outsider, don&apos;t
be ruled by plans.  Planning is often just a weakness forced on
those who delegate.<br><br>Is there a general rule for finding problems best solved in one
head?  Well, you can manufacture them by taking any project usually
done by multiple people and trying to do it all yourself.  Wozniak&apos;s
work was a classic example: he did everything himself, hardware and
software, and the result was miraculous.  He claims not one bug was
ever found in the Apple II, in either hardware or software.<br><br>Another way to find good problems to solve in one head is to focus
on the grooves in the chocolate bar&#x2014;the places where tasks are
divided when they&apos;re split between several people.  If you want to
beat delegation, focus on a vertical slice: for example, be both
writer and editor, or both design buildings and construct them.<br><br>One especially good groove to span is the one between tools and
things made with them.  For example, programming languages and
applications are usually written by different people, and this is
responsible for a lot of the worst flaws in 
<a href="hundred.html">programming languages</a>.
I think every language should be designed simultaneously with a
large application written in it, the way C was with Unix.<br><br>Techniques for competing with delegation translate well into business,
because delegation is endemic there.  Instead of avoiding it as a
drawback of senility, many companies embrace it as a sign of maturity.
In big companies software is often designed, implemented, and sold
by three separate types of people.  In startups one person may have
to do all three.  And though this feels stressful, it&apos;s one reason
startups win.  The needs of customers and the means of satisfying
them are all in one head.<br><br><b>Focus</b><br><br>The very skill of insiders can be a weakness.  Once someone is good
at something, they tend to spend all their time doing that.  This
kind of focus is very valuable, actually.  Much of the skill of
experts is the ability to ignore false trails.  But focus has
drawbacks: you don&apos;t learn from other fields, and when a new approach
arrives, you may be the last to notice.<br><br>For outsiders this translates into two ways to win.  One is to work
on a variety of things.  Since you can&apos;t derive as much benefit
(yet) from a narrow focus, you may as well cast a wider net and
derive what benefit you can from similarities between fields.  Just
as you can compete with delegation by working on larger vertical
slices, you can compete with specialization by working on larger
horizontal slices&#x2014;by both writing and illustrating your book, for
example.<br><br>The second way to compete with focus is to see what focus overlooks.
In particular, new things.  So if you&apos;re not good at anything yet,
consider working on something so new that no one else is either.
It won&apos;t have any prestige yet, if no one is good at it, but you&apos;ll
have it all to yourself.<br><br>The potential of a new medium is usually underestimated, precisely
because no one has yet explored its possibilities.  Before 
<a href="pilate.html">Durer</a>
tried making engravings, no one took them very seriously.  Engraving
was for making little devotional images&#x2014;basically fifteenth century
baseball cards of saints.  Trying to make masterpieces in this
medium must have seemed to Durer&apos;s contemporaries that way that,
say, making masterpieces in 
<a href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/artist/clowes/clowes.html">comics</a> 
might seem to the average person
today.<br><br>In the computer world we get not new mediums but new platforms: the
minicomputer, the microprocessor, the web-based application.  At
first they&apos;re always dismissed as being unsuitable for real work.
And yet someone always decides to try anyway, and it turns out you
can do more than anyone expected.  So in the future when you hear
people say of a new platform: yeah, it&apos;s popular and cheap, but not
ready yet for real work, jump on it.<br><br>As well as being more comfortable working on established lines,
insiders generally have a vested interest in perpetuating them.
The professor who made his reputation by discovering some new idea
is not likely to be the one to discover its replacement.  This is
particularly true with companies, who have not only skill and pride
anchoring them to the status quo, but money as well. The Achilles
heel of successful companies is their inability to cannibalize
themselves.  Many innovations consist of replacing something with
a cheaper alternative, and companies just don&apos;t want to see a path
whose immediate effect is to cut an existing source of revenue.<br><br>So if you&apos;re an outsider you should actively seek out contrarian
projects.  Instead of working on things the eminent have made
prestigious, work on things that could steal that prestige.<br><br>The really juicy new approaches are not the ones insiders reject
as impossible, but those they ignore as undignified.  For example,
after Wozniak designed the Apple II he offered it first to his
employer, HP.  They passed.  One of the reasons was that, to save
money, he&apos;d designed the Apple II to use a TV as a monitor, and HP
felt they couldn&apos;t produce anything so declasse.<br><br><b>Less</b><br><br>Wozniak used a TV as a monitor for the simple reason that he couldn&apos;t
afford a monitor.  Outsiders are not merely free but compelled to
make things that are cheap and lightweight.  And both are good bets
for growth: cheap things spread faster, and lightweight things
evolve faster.<br><br>The eminent, on the other hand, are almost forced to work on a large
scale.  Instead of garden sheds they must design huge art museums.
One reason they work on big things is that they can: like our
hypothetical novelist, they&apos;re flattered by such opportunities.
They also know that big projects will by their sheer bulk impress
the audience.  A garden shed, however lovely, would be easy to
ignore; a few might even snicker at it.  You can&apos;t snicker at a
giant museum, no matter how much you dislike it.  And finally, there
are all those people the eminent have working for them; they have
to choose projects that can keep them all busy.<br><br>Outsiders are free of all this.  They can work on small things, and
there&apos;s something very pleasing about small things.  Small things
can be perfect; big ones always have something wrong with them.
But there&apos;s a 
<a href="isetta.html">magic</a> 
in small things that goes beyond such rational
explanations.  All kids know it.  Small things have more personality.<br><br>Plus making them is more fun.  You can do what you want; you don&apos;t
have to satisfy committees.  And perhaps most important, small
things can be done fast.  The prospect of seeing the finished project
hangs in the air like the smell of dinner cooking.  If you work
fast, maybe you could have it done tonight.<br><br>Working on small things is also a good way to learn.  The most
important kinds of learning happen one project at a time.  (&quot;Next
time, I won&apos;t...&quot;)  The faster you cycle through projects, the
faster you&apos;ll evolve.<br><br>Plain materials have a charm like small scale.  And in addition
there&apos;s the challenge of making do with less.  Every designer&apos;s
ears perk up at the mention of that game, because it&apos;s a game you
can&apos;t lose.  Like the JV playing the varsity, if you even tie, you
win.  So paradoxically there are cases where fewer resources yield
better results, because the designers&apos; pleasure at their own ingenuity
more than compensates.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>So if you&apos;re an outsider, take advantage of your ability to make
small and inexpensive things.  Cultivate the pleasure and simplicity
of that kind of work; one day you&apos;ll miss it.<br><br><b>Responsibility</b><br><br>When you&apos;re old and eminent, what will you miss about being young
and obscure?  What people seem to miss most is the lack of
responsibilities.<br><br>Responsibility is an occupational disease of eminence.  In principle
you could avoid it, just as in principle you could avoid getting
fat as you get old, but few do.  I sometimes suspect that responsibility
is a trap and that the most virtuous route would be to shirk it,
but regardless it&apos;s certainly constraining.<br><br>When you&apos;re an outsider you&apos;re constrained too, of course.  You&apos;re
short of money, for example.  But that constrains you in different
ways.  How does responsibility constrain you?  The worst thing is
that it allows you not to focus on real work.  Just as the most
dangerous forms of 
<a href="procrastination.html">procrastination</a> 
are those that seem like work,
the danger of responsibilities is not just that they can consume a
whole day, but that they can do it without setting off the
kind of alarms you&apos;d set off if you spent a whole day sitting on a
park bench.<br><br>A lot of the pain of being an outsider is being aware of one&apos;s own
procrastination.  But this is actually a good thing.  You&apos;re at
least close enough to work that the smell of it makes you hungry.<br><br>As an outsider, you&apos;re just one step away from getting things done.
A huge step, admittedly, and one that most people never seem to
make, but only one step.  If you can summon up the energy to get
started, you can work on projects with an intensity (in both senses)
that few insiders can match.  For insiders work turns into a duty,
laden with responsibilities and expectations.  It&apos;s never so pure
as it was when they were young.<br><br>Work like a dog being taken for a walk, instead of an ox being yoked
to the plow.  That&apos;s what they miss.<br><br><b>Audience</b><br><br>A lot of outsiders make the mistake of doing the opposite; they
admire the eminent so much that they copy even their flaws.  Copying
is a good way to learn, but copy the right things.  When I was in
college I imitated the pompous diction of famous professors.  But
this wasn&apos;t what <i>made</i> them eminent&#x2014;it was more a flaw their
eminence had allowed them to sink into.   Imitating it was like
pretending to have gout in order to seem rich.<br><br>Half the distinguishing qualities of the eminent are actually
disadvantages.  Imitating these is not only a waste of time, but
will make you seem a fool to your models, who are often well aware
of it.<br><br>What are the genuine advantages of being an insider?  The greatest
is an audience.  It often seems to outsiders that the great advantage
of insiders is money&#x2014;that they have the resources to do what they
want.  But so do people who inherit money, and that doesn&apos;t seem
to help, not as much as an audience.  It&apos;s good for morale to know
people want to see what you&apos;re making; it draws work out of you.<br><br>If I&apos;m right that the defining advantage of insiders is an audience,
then we live in exciting times, because just in the last ten years
the Internet has made audiences a lot more liquid.  Outsiders don&apos;t
have to content themselves anymore with a proxy audience of a few
smart friends.  Now, thanks to the Internet, they can start to grow
themselves actual audiences.  This is great news for the marginal,
who retain the advantages of outsiders while increasingly being
able to siphon off what had till recently been the prerogative of
the elite.<br><br>Though the Web has been around for more than ten years, I think
we&apos;re just beginning to see its democratizing effects.  Outsiders
are still learning how to steal audiences.  But more importantly,
audiences are still learning how to be stolen&#x2014;they&apos;re still just
beginning to realize how much 
<a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2004/03/15/lott_case.html">deeper</a> bloggers can dig than
journalists, how much
<a href="http://reddit.com">more interesting</a> 
a democratic news site can be than a
front page controlled by editors, and how much
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLbFDMplZDs">funnier</a>
a bunch of kids
with webcams can be than mass-produced sitcoms.<br><br>The big media companies shouldn&apos;t worry that people will post their
copyrighted material on YouTube.  They should worry that people
will post their own stuff on YouTube, and audiences will watch that
instead.<br><br><b>Hacking</b><br><br>If I had to condense the power of the marginal into one sentence
it would be: just try hacking something together.  That phrase draws
in most threads I&apos;ve mentioned here.   Hacking something together
means deciding what to do as you&apos;re doing it, not a subordinate
executing the vision of his boss.  It implies the result won&apos;t
be pretty, because it will be made quickly out of inadequate
materials.  It may work, but it won&apos;t be the sort of thing the
eminent would want to put their name on.  Something hacked together
means something that barely solves the problem, or maybe doesn&apos;t
solve the problem at all, but another you discovered en route.  But
that&apos;s ok, because the main value of that initial version is not the
thing itself, but what it leads to.  Insiders who daren&apos;t walk
through the mud in their nice clothes will never make it to the
solid ground on the other side.<br><br>The word &quot;try&quot; is an especially valuable component.  I disagree
here with Yoda, who said there is no try.  There is try.  It implies
there&apos;s no punishment if you fail.  You&apos;re driven by curiosity
instead of duty.  That means the wind of procrastination will be
in your favor: instead of avoiding this work, this will be what you
do as a way of avoiding other work.  And when you do it, you&apos;ll be
in a better mood.  The more the work depends on imagination, the
more that matters, because most people have more ideas when they&apos;re
happy.<br><br>If I could go back and redo my twenties, that would be one thing
I&apos;d do more of: just try hacking things together.  Like many people
that age, I spent a lot of time worrying about what I should do.
I also spent some time trying to build stuff.  I should have spent
less time worrying and more time building.  If you&apos;re not sure what
to do, make something.<br><br>Raymond Chandler&apos;s advice to thriller writers was &quot;When in doubt,
have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand.&quot;  He followed
that advice.  Judging from his books, he was often in doubt.  But
though the result is occasionally cheesy, it&apos;s never boring.  In
life, as in books, action is underrated.<br><br>Fortunately the number of things you can just hack together keeps
increasing.   People fifty years ago would be astonished that one
could just hack together a movie, for example.  Now you can even
hack together distribution.  Just make stuff and put it online.<br><br><b>Inappropriate</b><br><br>If you really want to score big, the place to focus is the margin
of the margin: the territories only recently captured from the
insiders.  That&apos;s where you&apos;ll find the juiciest projects still
undone, either because they seemed too risky, or simply because
there were too few insiders to explore everything.<br><br>This is why I spend most of my time writing 
<a href="essay.html">essays</a> lately.  The
writing of essays used to be limited to those who could get them
published.  In principle you could have written them and just shown
them to your friends; in practice that didn&apos;t work.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font>
An
essayist needs the resistance of an audience, just as an engraver
needs the resistance of the plate.<br><br>Up till a few years ago, writing essays was the ultimate insider&apos;s
game.  Domain experts were allowed to publish essays about their
field, but the pool allowed to write on general topics was about
eight people who went to the right parties in New York.  Now the
reconquista has overrun this territory, and, not surprisingly, found
it sparsely cultivated.  There are so many essays yet unwritten.
They tend to be the naughtier ones; the insiders have pretty much
exhausted the motherhood and apple pie topics.<br><br>This leads to my final suggestion: a technique for determining when
you&apos;re on the right track.  You&apos;re on the right track when people
complain that you&apos;re unqualified, or that you&apos;ve done something
inappropriate.  If people are complaining, that means you&apos;re doing
something rather than sitting around, which is the first step.  And
if they&apos;re driven to such empty forms of complaint, that means
you&apos;ve probably done something good.<br><br>If you make something and people complain that it doesn&apos;t <i>work</i>,
that&apos;s a problem.  But if the worst thing they can hit you with is
your own status as an outsider, that implies that in every other
respect you&apos;ve succeeded.  Pointing out that someone is unqualified
is as desperate as resorting to racial slurs. It&apos;s just a legitimate
sounding way of saying: we don&apos;t like your type around here.<br><br>But the best thing of all is when people call what you&apos;re doing
inappropriate.  I&apos;ve been hearing this word all my life and I only
recently realized that it is, in fact, the sound of the homing
beacon.  &quot;Inappropriate&quot; is the null criticism.  It&apos;s merely the
adjective form of &quot;I don&apos;t like it.&quot;<br><br>So that, I think, should be the highest goal for the marginal.  Be
inappropriate.  When you hear people saying that, you&apos;re golden.
And they, incidentally, are busted.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]

As usual the popular image is several decades behind reality.
Now the misunderstood artist is not a chain-smoking drunk who pours
his soul into big, messy canvases that philistines see and say
&quot;that&apos;s not art&quot; because it isn&apos;t a picture of anything.  The
philistines have now been trained that anything hung on a wall
is art.  Now the misunderstood artist is a coffee-drinking vegan
cartoonist whose work they see and say &quot;that&apos;s not art&quot; because it
looks like stuff they&apos;ve seen in the Sunday paper.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]

In high school you&apos;re led to believe your whole future depends
on where you go to college, but it turns out only to buy you a couple

Managers are presumably wondering, how can I make this miracle
happen?  How can I make the people working for me do more with less?

you&apos;re <i>expected</i> to do more with less, then you&apos;re being
starved, not eating virtuously.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Without the prospect of publication, the closest most people
come to writing essays is to write in a journal.  I find I never
get as deeply into subjects as I do in proper essays.  As the name
implies, you don&apos;t go back and rewrite journal entries over
and over for two weeks.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Sarah

to.  Imagine you were going to spend the weekend at a friend&apos;s house
on a little island off the coast of Maine.  There are no shops on
the island and you won&apos;t be able to leave while you&apos;re there.  Also,
you&apos;ve never been to this house before, so you can&apos;t assume it will
have more than any house might.<br><br>What, besides clothes and toiletries, do you make a point of packing?
That&apos;s what you&apos;re addicted to.  For example, if you find yourself
packing a bottle of vodka (just in case), you may want to stop and
think about that.<br><br>For me the list is four things: books, earplugs, a notebook, and a
pen.<br><br>There are other things I might bring if I thought of it, like music,
or tea, but I can live without them.  I&apos;m not so addicted to caffeine
that I wouldn&apos;t risk the house not having any tea, just for a
weekend.<br><br>Quiet is another matter.  I realize it seems a bit eccentric to
take earplugs on a trip to an island off the coast of Maine.  If
anywhere should be quiet, that should.  But what if the person in
the next room snored?  What if there was a kid playing basketball?
(Thump, thump, thump... thump.)  Why risk it?  Earplugs are small.<br><br>Sometimes I can think with noise.  If I already have momentum on
some project, I can work in noisy places.  I can edit an essay or
debug code in an airport.  But airports are not so bad: most of the
noise is whitish.  I couldn&apos;t work with the sound of a sitcom coming
through the wall, or a car in the street playing thump-thump music.<br><br>And of course there&apos;s another kind of thinking, when you&apos;re starting
something new, that requires complete quiet.   You never
know when this will strike. It&apos;s just as well to carry plugs.<br><br>The notebook and pen are professional equipment, as it were.  Though
actually there is something druglike about them, in the sense that
their main purpose is to make me feel better.  I hardly ever go
back and read stuff I write down in notebooks.  It&apos;s just that if
I can&apos;t write things down, worrying about remembering one idea gets
in the way of having the next.  Pen and paper wick ideas.<br><br>The best notebooks I&apos;ve found are made by a company called Miquelrius.
I use their smallest size, which is about 2.5 x 4 in.
The secret to writing on such
narrow pages is to break words only when you run out of space, like
a Latin inscription.  I use the cheapest plastic Bic ballpoints,
partly because their gluey ink doesn&apos;t seep through pages, and
partly so I don&apos;t worry about losing them.<br><br>I only started carrying a notebook about three years ago.  Before
that I used whatever scraps of paper I could find.  But the problem
with scraps of paper is that they&apos;re not ordered.  In a notebook
you can guess what a scribble means by looking at the pages
around it.  In the scrap era I was constantly finding notes I&apos;d
written years before that might say something I needed to remember,
if I could only figure out what.<br><br>As for books, I know the house would probably have something to
read.  On the average trip I bring four books and only read one of
them, because I find new books to read en route.  Really bringing
books is insurance.<br><br>I realize this dependence on books is not entirely good&#x2014;that what
I need them for is distraction.  The books I bring on trips are
often quite virtuous, the sort of stuff that might be assigned
reading in a college class.  But I know my motives aren&apos;t virtuous.
I bring books because if the world gets boring I need to be able
to slip into another distilled by some writer.  It&apos;s like eating
jam when you know you should be eating fruit.<br><br>There is a point where I&apos;ll do without books.  I was walking in
some steep mountains once, and decided I&apos;d rather just think, if I
was bored, rather than carry a single unnecessary ounce.  It wasn&apos;t
so bad.  I found I could entertain myself by having ideas instead
of reading other people&apos;s.  If you stop eating jam, fruit starts
to taste better.<br><br>So maybe I&apos;ll try not bringing books on some future trip.  They&apos;re
going to have to pry the plugs out of my cold, dead ears, however.<br><br><br clear="all"></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.simpleoption.com/ensayo-test-isla">Spanish Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/lionfan/20060721">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="copy">Copy What You Like</h1><a href="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2202_8480086"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2202_8556527" width="410" height="216" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a><br><br><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">July 2006<br><br><!-- <table width=375 cellpadding=6 cellspacing=0>

When I was in high school I spent a lot of time imitating bad
writers.  What we studied in English classes was mostly fiction,
so I assumed that was the highest form of writing.  Mistake number
one.  The stories that seemed to be most admired were ones in which
people suffered in complicated ways.  Anything funny or
gripping was ipso facto suspect, unless it was old enough to be hard to
understand, like Shakespeare or Chaucer.  Mistake number two.  The
ideal medium seemed the short story, which I&apos;ve since learned had
quite a brief life, roughly coincident with the peak of magazine
publishing.  But since their size made them perfect for use in
high school classes, we read a lot of them, which gave us the
impression the short story was flourishing.  Mistake number three.
And because they were so short, nothing really had to happen; you
could just show a randomly truncated slice of life, and that was
considered advanced.  Mistake number four.  The result was that I
wrote a lot of stories in which nothing happened except that someone
was unhappy in a way that seemed deep.<br><br>For most of college I was a philosophy major.  I was very impressed
by the papers published in philosophy journals.  They were so
beautifully typeset, and their tone was just captivating&#x2014;alternately
casual and buffer-overflowingly technical.  A fellow would be walking
along a street and suddenly modality qua modality would spring upon
him.  I didn&apos;t ever quite understand these papers, but I figured
I&apos;d get around to that later, when I had time to reread them more
closely.  In the meantime I tried my best to imitate them.  This
was, I can now see, a doomed undertaking, because they weren&apos;t
really saying anything.  No philosopher ever refuted another, for
example, because no one said anything definite enough to refute.
Needless to say, my imitations didn&apos;t say anything either.<br><br>In grad school I was still wasting time imitating the wrong things.
There was then a fashionable type of program called an expert system,
at the core of which was something called an inference engine.  I
looked at what these things did and thought &quot;I could write that in
a thousand lines of code.&quot;  And yet eminent professors were writing
books about them, and startups were selling them for a year&apos;s salary
a copy.  What an opportunity, I thought; these impressive things
seem easy to me; I must be pretty sharp.  Wrong.  It was simply a
fad.  The books the professors wrote about expert systems are now
ignored.  They were not even on a <i>path</i> to anything interesting.
And the customers paying so much for them were largely the same
government agencies that paid thousands for screwdrivers and toilet
seats.<br><br>How do you avoid copying the wrong things?  Copy only what you
genuinely like.  That would have saved me in all three cases.  I
didn&apos;t enjoy the short stories we had to read in English classes;
I didn&apos;t learn anything from philosophy papers; I didn&apos;t use expert
systems myself.  I believed these things were good because they
were admired.<br><br>It can be hard to separate the things you like from the things
you&apos;re impressed with.  One trick is to ignore presentation.  Whenever
I see a painting impressively hung in a museum, I ask myself: how
much would I pay for this if I found it at a garage sale, dirty and
frameless, and with no idea who painted it?  If you walk around a
museum trying this experiment, you&apos;ll find you get some truly
startling results.  Don&apos;t ignore this data point just because it&apos;s
an outlier.<br><br>Another way to figure out what you like is to look at what you enjoy
as guilty pleasures.  Many things people like, especially if they&apos;re
young and ambitious, they like largely for the feeling of virtue
in liking them.  99% of people reading <i>Ulysses</i> are thinking
&quot;I&apos;m reading <i>Ulysses</i>&quot; as they do it. A guilty pleasure is
at least a pure one.  What do you read when you don&apos;t feel up to being
virtuous?  What kind of book do you read and feel sad that there&apos;s
only half of it left, instead of being impressed that you&apos;re half
way through?  That&apos;s what you really like.<br><br>Even when you find genuinely good things to copy, there&apos;s another
pitfall to be avoided.  Be careful to copy what makes them good,
rather than their flaws.  It&apos;s easy to be drawn into imitating
flaws, because they&apos;re easier to see, and of course easier to copy
too.  For example, most painters in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries used brownish colors.  They were imitating the great
painters of the Renaissance, whose paintings by that time were brown
with dirt.  Those paintings have since been cleaned, revealing
brilliant colors; their imitators are of course still brown.<br><br>It was painting, incidentally, that cured me of copying the wrong
things.  Halfway through grad school I decided I wanted to try being
a painter, and the art world was so manifestly corrupt that it
snapped the leash of credulity.  These people made philosophy
professors seem as scrupulous as mathematicians.  It was so clearly
a choice of doing good work xor being an insider that I was forced
to see the distinction.  It&apos;s there to some degree in almost every
field, but I had till then managed to avoid facing it.<br><br>That was one of the most valuable things I learned from painting:
you have to figure out for yourself what&apos;s 
<a href="taste.html">good</a>.  You can&apos;t trust
authorities. They&apos;ll lie to you on this one.<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="http://reddit.com"><img src="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/redditino.png" border="0"></a>

August 2006, rev. April 2007, September 2010<br><br>In a few days it will be Demo Day, when the startups we funded
this summer present to investors.  Y Combinator funds startups twice
a year, in January and June.  Ten weeks later we invite all the
investors we know to hear them present what they&apos;ve built so far.<br><br>Ten weeks is not much time.  The average startup probably doesn&apos;t
have much to show for itself after ten weeks.  But the average
startup fails.  When you look at the ones that went on to do great
things, you find a lot that began with someone pounding out a
prototype in a week or two of nonstop work.  Startups are a
counterexample to the rule that haste makes waste.<br><br>(Too much money seems to be as bad for startups as too much time,
so we don&apos;t give them much money either.)<br><br>A week before Demo Day, we have a dress rehearsal called Rehearsal Day.
At other Y Combinator events we allow outside guests, but not at
Rehearsal Day.  No one except the other founders gets to see the rehearsals.<br><br>The presentations on Rehearsal Day are often pretty rough.  But this is
to be expected.  We try to pick founders who are good at building
things, not ones who are slick presenters.  Some of the founders
are just out of college, or even still in it, and have never spoken
to a group of people they didn&apos;t already know.<br><br>So we concentrate on the basics.  On Demo Day each startup will
only get ten minutes, so we encourage them to focus on just two
goals: (a) explain what you&apos;re doing, and (b) explain why users
will want it.<br><br>That might sound easy, but it&apos;s not when the speakers have no
experience presenting, and they&apos;re explaining technical matters to
an audience that&apos;s mostly non-technical.<br><br>This situation is constantly repeated when startups present to
investors: people who are bad at explaining, talking to people who
are bad at understanding.  Practically every successful startup,
including stars like Google, presented at some point to investors
who didn&apos;t get it and turned them down.  Was it because the founders
were bad at presenting, or because the investors were obtuse?  It&apos;s
probably always some of both.<br><br>At the most recent Rehearsal Day, we four Y Combinator partners found
ourselves saying a lot of the same things we said at the last two.
So at dinner afterward we collected all our tips about presenting
to investors.  Most startups face similar challenges, so we hope
these will be useful to a wider audience.<br><br>
<b>1. Explain what you&apos;re doing.</b><br><br>Investors&apos; main question when judging a very early startup is whether
you&apos;ve made a compelling product.  Before they can judge whether
you&apos;ve built a good x, they have to understand what kind of x you&apos;ve
built.  They will get very frustrated if instead of telling them
what you do, you make them sit through some kind of preamble.<br><br>Say what you&apos;re doing as soon as possible, preferably in the first
sentence. &quot;We&apos;re Jeff and Bob and we&apos;ve built an easy to use web-based
database.  Now we&apos;ll show it to you and explain why people need
this.&quot;<br><br>If you&apos;re a great public speaker you may be able to violate this
rule.  Last year one founder spent the whole first half of his talk
on a fascinating analysis of the limits of the conventional desktop
metaphor.  He got away with it, but unless you&apos;re a captivating
speaker, which most hackers aren&apos;t, it&apos;s better to play it safe.<br><br><b>2. Get rapidly to demo.</b><br><br><i>This section is now obsolete for YC founders presenting
at Demo Day, because Demo Day presentations are now so short
that they rarely include much if any demo.  They seem to work
just as well without, however, which makes me think I was
wrong to emphasize demos so much before.</i><br><br>A demo explains what you&apos;ve made more effectively than any verbal
description.  The only thing worth talking about first is the problem
you&apos;re trying to solve and why it&apos;s important.  But don&apos;t spend
more than a tenth of your time on that.  Then demo.<br><br>When you demo, don&apos;t run through a catalog of features.  Instead
start with the problem you&apos;re solving, and then show how your product
solves it.  Show features in an order driven by some kind of purpose,
rather than the order in which they happen to appear on the screen.<br><br>If you&apos;re demoing something web-based, assume that the network
connection will mysteriously die 30 seconds into your presentation,
and come prepared with a copy of the server software running on
your laptop.<br><br><b>3. Better a narrow description than a vague one.</b><br><br>One reason founders resist describing their projects concisely is
that, at this early stage, there are all kinds of possibilities.
The most concise descriptions seem misleadingly narrow.  So for
example a group that has built an easy web-based database might
resist calling their applicaton that, because it could be so much
more.  In fact, it could be anything...<br><br>The problem is, as you approach (in the calculus sense) a description
of something that could be anything, the content of your description
approaches zero.  If you describe your web-based database as &quot;a
system to allow people to collaboratively leverage the value of
information,&quot; it will go in one investor ear and out the other.
They&apos;ll just discard that sentence as meaningless boilerplate, and
hope, with increasing impatience, that in the next sentence you&apos;ll
actually explain what you&apos;ve made.<br><br>Your primary goal is not to describe everything your system might
one day become, but simply to convince investors you&apos;re worth talking
to further.  So approach this like an algorithm that gets the right
answer by successive approximations.  Begin with a description
that&apos;s gripping but perhaps overly narrow, then flesh it out to the
extent you can.  It&apos;s the same principle as incremental development:
start with a simple prototype, then add features, but at every point
have working code.  In this case, &quot;working code&quot; means a working
description in the investor&apos;s head.<br><br><b>4. Don&apos;t talk and drive.</b><br><br>Have one person talk while another uses the computer.  If the same
person does both, they&apos;ll inevitably mumble downwards at the computer
screen instead of talking clearly at the audience.<br><br>As long as you&apos;re standing near the audience and looking at them,
politeness (and habit) compel them to pay attention to you.  Once
you stop looking at them to fuss with something on your computer,
their minds drift off to the errands they have to run later.<br><br><b>5. Don&apos;t talk about secondary matters at length.</b><br><br>If you only have a few minutes, spend them explaining what your
product does and why it&apos;s great.  Second order issues like competitors
or resumes should be single slides you go through quickly at the
end.  If you have impressive resumes, just flash them on the screen
for 15 seconds and say a few words.  For competitors, list the top
3 and explain in one sentence each what they lack
that you have.  And put this kind of thing at the end, after you&apos;ve
made it clear what you&apos;ve built.<br><br><b>6. Don&apos;t get too deeply into business models.</b><br><br>It&apos;s good to talk about how you plan to make money, but mainly
because it shows you care about that and have thought about it.
Don&apos;t go into detail about your business model, because (a) that&apos;s
not what smart investors care about in a brief presentation, and
(b) any business model you have at this point is probably wrong
anyway.<br><br>Recently a VC who came to speak at Y Combinator talked about a
company he just invested in.  He said their business model was wrong
and would probably change three times before they got it right.
The founders were experienced guys who&apos;d done startups before and
who&apos;d just succeeded in getting millions from one of the top VC
firms, and even their business model was crap.  (And yet he invested
anyway, because he expected it to be crap at this stage.)<br><br>If you&apos;re solving an important problem, you&apos;re going to sound a lot
smarter talking about that than the business model.  The business
model is just a bunch of guesses, and guesses about stuff that&apos;s
probably not your area of expertise.  So don&apos;t spend your precious
few minutes talking about crap when you could be talking about
solid, interesting things you know a lot about: the problem you&apos;re
solving and what you&apos;ve built so far.<br><br>As well as being a bad use of time, if your business model seems
spectacularly wrong, that will push the stuff you want investors
to remember out of their heads.  They&apos;ll just remember you as the
company with the boneheaded plan for making money, rather than the
company that solved that important problem.<br><br><b>7. Talk slowly and clearly at the audience.</b><br><br>Everyone at Rehearsal Day could see the difference between the people
who&apos;d been out in the world for a while and had presented to groups,
and those who hadn&apos;t.<br><br>You need to use a completely different voice and manner talking to
a roomful of people than you would in conversation.  Everyday life
gives you no practice in this.  If you can&apos;t already do it, the
best solution is to treat it as a consciously artificial trick,
like juggling.<br><br>However, that doesn&apos;t mean you should talk like some kind of
announcer.  Audiences tune that out.  What you need to do is talk
in this artificial way, and yet make it seem conversational.  (Writing
is the same.  Good writing is an elaborate effort to seem spontaneous.)<br><br>If you want to write out your whole presentation beforehand and
memorize it, that&apos;s ok.  That has worked for some groups in the
past.  But make sure to write something that sounds like spontaneous,
informal speech, and deliver it that way too.<br><br>Err on the side of speaking slowly.  At Rehearsal Day, one of the founders
mentioned a rule actors use: if you feel you&apos;re speaking too slowly,
you&apos;re speaking at about the right speed.<br><br><b>8. Have one person talk.</b><br><br>Startups often want to show that all the founders are equal partners.
This is a good instinct; investors dislike unbalanced teams.  But
trying to show it by partitioning the presentation is going too
far.  It&apos;s distracting.  You can demonstrate your respect
for one another in more subtle ways.  For example, when one of the
groups presented at Demo Day, the more extroverted of the two
founders did most of the talking, but he described his co-founder
as the best hacker he&apos;d ever met, and you could tell he meant it.<br><br>Pick the one or at most two best speakers, and have them do most
of the talking.<br><br>Exception: If one of the founders is an expert in some specific
technical field, it can be good for them to talk about that for a
minute or so.  This kind of &quot;expert witness&quot; can add credibility,
even if the audience doesn&apos;t understand all the details.  If Jobs
and Wozniak had 10 minutes to present the Apple II, it might be a good plan
to have Jobs speak for 9 minutes and have Woz speak for a minute
in the middle about some of the technical feats he&apos;d pulled off in
the design.  (Though of course if it were actually those two, Jobs
would speak for the entire 10 minutes.)<br><br><b>9. Seem confident.</b><br><br>Between the brief time available and their lack of technical
background, many in the audience will have a hard time evaluating
what you&apos;re doing.  Probably the single biggest piece of evidence,
initially, will be your own confidence in it.   You have
to show you&apos;re impressed with what you&apos;ve made.<br><br>And I mean show, not tell.  Never say &quot;we&apos;re passionate&quot; or &quot;our
product is great.&quot;  People just ignore that&#x2014;or worse, write you
off as bullshitters.  Such messages must be implicit.<br><br>What you must not do is seem nervous and apologetic.  If you&apos;ve
truly made something good, you&apos;re doing investors a <i>favor</i> by
telling them about it.  If you don&apos;t genuinely believe that, perhaps
you ought to change what your company is doing.  If you don&apos;t believe
your startup has such promise that you&apos;d be doing them a favor by
letting them invest, why are you investing your time in it?<br><br><b>10. Don&apos;t try to seem more than you are.</b><br><br>Don&apos;t worry if your company is just a few months old and doesn&apos;t
have an office yet, or your founders are technical people with no
business experience.  Google was like that once, and they turned out
ok.  Smart investors can see past such superficial flaws.  They&apos;re
not looking for finished, smooth presentations.  They&apos;re looking
for raw talent.  All you need to convince them of is that you&apos;re
smart and that you&apos;re onto something good.  If you try too hard to
conceal your rawness&#x2014;by trying to seem corporate, or pretending
to know about stuff you don&apos;t&#x2014;you may just conceal your talent.<br><br>You can afford to be candid about what you haven&apos;t figured out yet.
Don&apos;t go out of your way to bring it up (e.g. by having a slide
about what might go wrong), but don&apos;t try to pretend either that
you&apos;re further along than you are.  If you&apos;re a hacker and you&apos;re
presenting to experienced investors, they&apos;re probably better at
detecting bullshit than you are at producing it.<br><br><b>11. Don&apos;t put too many words on slides.</b><br><br>When there are a lot of words on a slide, people just skip reading
it.  So look at your slides and ask of each word &quot;could I cross
this out?&quot;  This includes gratuitous clip art.  Try to get your
slides under 20 words if you can.<br><br>Don&apos;t read your slides.  They should be something in the background
as you face the audience and talk to them, not something you face
and read to an audience sitting behind you.<br><br>Cluttered sites don&apos;t do well in demos, especially when they&apos;re
projected onto a screen.  At the very least, crank up the font size
big enough to make all the text legible.  But cluttered sites are
bad anyway, so perhaps you should use this opportunity to make your
design simpler.<br><br><b>12. Specific numbers are good.</b><br><br>If you have any kind of data, however preliminary, tell the audience.
Numbers stick in people&apos;s heads.  If you can claim that the median
visitor generates 12 page views, that&apos;s great.<br><br>But don&apos;t give them more than four or five numbers, and only give
them numbers specific to you.  You don&apos;t need to tell them the size
of the market you&apos;re in.  Who cares, really, if it&apos;s 500 million
or 5 billion a year?  Talking about that is like an actor at the
beginning of his career telling his parents how much Tom Hanks
makes.  Yeah, sure, but first you have to become Tom Hanks.  The
important part is not whether he makes ten million a year or a
hundred, but how you get there.<br><br><b>13. Tell stories about users.</b><br><br>The biggest fear of investors looking at early stage startups is
that you&apos;ve built something based on your own a priori theories of
what the world needs, but that no one will actually want.  So it&apos;s
good if you can talk about problems specific users have and how you
solve them.<br><br>Greg Mcadoo said one thing Sequoia looks for is the &quot;proxy for
demand.&quot;  What are people doing now, using inadequate tools, that
shows they need what you&apos;re making?<br><br>Another sign of user need is when people pay a lot for something.
It&apos;s easy to convince investors there will be demand for
a cheaper alternative to something popular, if you preserve
the qualities that made it popular.<br><br>The best stories about user needs are about your own.  A remarkable
number of famous startups grew out of some need the founders had:
Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Google.  Experienced investors know that,
so stories of this type will get their attention.  The next best
thing is to talk about the needs of people you know personally,
like your friends or siblings.<br><br><b>14. Make a soundbite stick in their heads.</b><br><br>Professional investors hear a lot of pitches.  After a while they
all blur together.  The first cut is simply to be one of those
they remember.  And the way to ensure that is to create a descriptive
phrase about yourself that sticks in their heads.<br><br>In Hollywood, these phrases seem to be of the form &quot;x meets y.&quot;
<!-- "Brokeback Mountain meets Godzilla."  [Pauses to contemplate this.] -->
In the startup world, they&apos;re usually &quot;the x of y&quot; or &quot;the x y.&quot;
Viaweb&apos;s was &quot;the Microsoft Word of ecommerce.&quot;<br><br>Find one and launch it clearly (but apparently casually) in your
talk, preferably near the beginning.<br><br>It&apos;s a good exercise for you, too, to sit down and try to figure
out how to describe your startup in one compelling phrase.  If you
can&apos;t, your plans may not be sufficiently focused.<br><br><br clear="all"></p></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="startupfunding.html">How to Fund a Startup</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="guidetoinvestors.html">Hackers&apos; Guide to Investors</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.simpleoption.com/ensayo-como-presentarte-inversores.html">Spanish Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/lionfan/20070130">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.perevedem.ru/article/investors.htm">Russian Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br>

<p>
October 2006<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at MIT.)</i><br><br>Till recently graduating seniors had two choices: get a job or go
to grad school.  I think there will increasingly be a third option:
to start your own startup.  But how common will that be?<br><br>I&apos;m sure the default will always be to get a job, but starting a
startup could well become as popular as grad school.  In the late
90s my professor friends used to complain that they couldn&apos;t get
grad students, because all the undergrads were going to work for
startups.  I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if that situation returns, but
with one difference: this time they&apos;ll be starting their own
instead of going to work for other people&apos;s.<br><br>The most ambitious students will at this point be asking: Why wait
till you graduate?  Why not start a startup while you&apos;re in college?
In fact, why go to college at all?  Why not start a startup instead?<br><br>A year and a half ago I gave a <a href="hiring.html">talk</a> 
where I said that the average age of the founders of
Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft was 24, and that if grad students could
start startups, why not undergrads?  I&apos;m glad I phrased that as a
question, because now I can pretend it wasn&apos;t merely a rhetorical
one.  At the time I couldn&apos;t imagine why there should be any lower
limit for the age of startup founders.  Graduation is a bureaucratic
change, not a biological one.  And certainly there are undergrads
as competent technically as most grad students.  So why shouldn&apos;t
undergrads be able to start startups as well as grad students?<br><br>I now realize that something does change at graduation: you lose a
huge excuse for failing.  Regardless of how complex your life is,
you&apos;ll find that everyone else, including your family and friends,
will discard all the low bits and regard you as having a single
occupation at any given time.  If you&apos;re in college and have a
summer job writing software, you still read as a student.  Whereas
if you graduate and get a job programming, you&apos;ll be instantly
regarded by everyone as a programmer.<br><br>The problem with starting a startup while you&apos;re still in school
is that there&apos;s a built-in escape hatch.  If you start a startup
in the summer between your junior and senior year, it reads to
everyone as a summer job.
So if it goes nowhere, big deal; you return to school in the
fall with all the other seniors; no one regards you as a failure,
because your occupation is student, and you didn&apos;t fail at that.
Whereas if you start a startup just one year later, after you
graduate, as long as you&apos;re not accepted to grad school in the fall
the startup reads to everyone as your occupation.  You&apos;re
now a startup founder, so you have to do well at that.<br><br>For nearly everyone, the opinion of one&apos;s peers is the most powerful
motivator of all&#x2014;more powerful even than the nominal goal of most
startup founders, getting rich.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font>
About a month into each funding
cycle we have an event called Prototype Day where each startup
presents to the others what they&apos;ve got so far.  You might think
they wouldn&apos;t need any more motivation.  They&apos;re working on their
cool new idea; they have funding for the immediate future; and
they&apos;re playing a game with only two outcomes: wealth or failure.
You&apos;d think that would be motivation enough.  And yet the prospect
of a demo pushes most of them into a
rush of activity.<br><br>Even if you start a startup explicitly to get rich, the money you
might get seems pretty theoretical most of the time.  What drives
you day to day is not wanting to look bad.<br><br>You probably can&apos;t change that.  Even if you could, I don&apos;t think
you&apos;d want to; someone who really, truly doesn&apos;t care what his peers
think of him is probably a psychopath.  So the best you can do is
consider this force like a wind, and set up your boat accordingly.
If you know your peers are going to push you in some direction,
choose good peers, and position yourself so they push you in a
direction you like.<br><br>Graduation changes the prevailing winds, and those make a difference.
Starting a startup is so hard
that it&apos;s a close call even for the ones that succeed.  However
high a startup may be flying now, it probably has a few leaves stuck
in the landing gear from those trees it barely cleared at the end
of the runway.  In such a close game, the smallest increase in the
forces against you can be enough to flick you over the edge into
failure.<br><br>When we first started <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> 
we encouraged people to start
startups while they were still in college.  That&apos;s partly because
Y Combinator began as a kind of summer program.  We&apos;ve kept the
program shape&#x2014;all of us having dinner together once a week turns
out to be a good idea&#x2014;but we&apos;ve decided now
that the party line should be to tell people to wait till they
graduate.<br><br>Does that mean you can&apos;t start a startup in college?  Not at all.
Sam Altman, the co-founder of <a href="http://loopt.com">Loopt</a>,
had just finished his sophomore year when we funded them, and Loopt
is probably the most promising of all the startups we&apos;ve funded so
far.  But Sam Altman is a very unusual guy.  Within about three
minutes of meeting him, I remember thinking &quot;Ah, so this is what
Bill Gates must have been like when he was 19.&quot;<br><br>If it can work to start a startup during college, why do
we tell people not to?  For the same reason that the probably
apocryphal violinist, whenever he was asked to judge someone&apos;s
playing, would always say they didn&apos;t have enough talent to make
it as a pro.  Succeeding as a musician takes determination as well
as talent, so this answer works out to be the right advice for
everyone.  The ones who are uncertain believe it and give up, and
the ones who are sufficiently determined think &quot;screw that, I&apos;ll
succeed anyway.&quot;<br><br>So our official policy now is only to fund undergrads we can&apos;t talk
out of it.  And frankly, if you&apos;re not certain, you <i>should</i> wait.
It&apos;s not as if all the opportunities to start companies are going
to be gone if you don&apos;t do it now.  Maybe the window will close on
some idea you&apos;re working on, but that won&apos;t be the last idea you&apos;ll
have.  For every idea that times out, new ones become feasible.
Historically the opportunities to start startups have only increased
with time.<br><br>In that case, you might ask, why not wait longer?  Why not go work
for a while, or go to grad school, and then start a startup?  And
indeed, that might be a good idea.  If I had to pick the sweet spot
for startup founders, based on who we&apos;re most excited to see
applications from, I&apos;d say it&apos;s probably the mid-twenties.  Why?
What advantages does someone in their mid-twenties have over someone
who&apos;s 21?  And why isn&apos;t it older?  What can 25 year olds do that
32 year olds can&apos;t?  Those turn out to be questions worth examining.<br><br><b>Plus</b><br><br>If you start a startup soon after college, you&apos;ll be a young founder
by present standards, so you should know what the relative advantages
of young founders are.  They&apos;re not what you might think.  As a
young founder your strengths are: stamina, poverty, rootlessness,
colleagues, and ignorance.<br><br>The importance of stamina shouldn&apos;t be surprising.  If you&apos;ve heard
anything about startups you&apos;ve probably heard about the long hours.
As far as I can tell these are universal.  I can&apos;t think of any
successful startups whose founders worked 9 to 5.  And it&apos;s
particularly necessary for younger founders to work long hours
because they&apos;re probably not as efficient as they&apos;ll be later.<br><br>Your second advantage, poverty, might not sound like an advantage,
but it is a huge one.  Poverty implies you can live cheaply,
and this is critically important for startups.  Nearly every startup
that fails, fails by running out of money.  It&apos;s a little misleading
to put it this way, because there&apos;s usually some other underlying
cause.  But regardless of the source of your problems, a low burn
rate gives you more opportunity to recover from them.  And since
most startups make all kinds of mistakes at first, room to recover
from mistakes is a valuable thing to have.<br><br>Most startups end up doing something different than they planned.
The way the successful ones find something that works is by trying
things that don&apos;t.  So the worst thing you can do in a startup is
to have a rigid, pre-ordained plan and then start spending a lot
of money to implement it.  Better to operate cheaply and give your
ideas time to evolve.<br><br>Recent grads can live on practically nothing, and this gives you
an edge over older founders, because the main cost in software
startups is people.  The guys with kids and mortgages are at a
real disadvantage.  This is one reason I&apos;d bet on the 25 year old
over the 32 year old.  The 32 year old probably is a better programmer,
but probably also has a much more expensive life.  Whereas a 25
year old has some work experience (more on that later) but can live
as cheaply as an undergrad.<br><br>Robert Morris and I were 29 and 30 respectively when we started
Viaweb, but fortunately we still lived like 23 year olds.  We both had
roughly zero assets.  I would have loved to have a mortgage,
since that would have meant I had a <i>house</i>.  But in retrospect
having nothing turned out to be convenient. I wasn&apos;t tied down and
I was used to living cheaply.<br><br>Even more important than living cheaply, though, is thinking cheaply.
One reason the Apple II was so popular was that it was cheap.  The
computer itself was cheap, and it used cheap, off-the-shelf peripherals
like a cassette tape recorder for data storage and a TV as a monitor.
And you know why?  Because Woz designed this computer for himself,
and he couldn&apos;t afford anything more.<br><br>We benefitted from the same phenomenon.  Our prices were
daringly low for the time.  The top level of service was
$300 a month, which was an order of magnitude below the norm.  In
retrospect this was a smart move, but we didn&apos;t do it because we
were smart.  $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.  Like
Apple, we created something inexpensive, and therefore popular,
simply because we were poor.<br><br>A lot of startups have that form: someone comes along and makes
something for a tenth or a hundredth of what it used to cost, and
the existing players can&apos;t follow because they don&apos;t even want to
think about a world in which that&apos;s possible.  Traditional long
distance carriers, for example, didn&apos;t even want to think about
VoIP.  (It was coming, all the same.)  Being poor helps in this
game, because your own personal bias points in the same direction
technology evolves in.<br><br>The advantages of rootlessness are similar to those of poverty.
When you&apos;re young you&apos;re more mobile&#x2014;not just because you don&apos;t
have a house or much stuff, but also because you&apos;re less likely to
have serious relationships.  This turns out to be important, because
a lot of startups involve someone moving.<br><br>The founders of Kiko, for example, are now en route to the Bay Area
to start their next startup.  It&apos;s a better place for what they
want to do.  And it was easy for them to decide to go, because
neither as far as I know has a serious girlfriend, and everything
they own will fit in one car&#x2014;or more precisely, will either fit
in one car or is crappy enough that they don&apos;t mind leaving it
behind.<br><br>They at least were in Boston.  What if they&apos;d been in Nebraska,
like Evan Williams was at their age?   Someone wrote recently that
the drawback of Y Combinator was that you had to move to participate.
It couldn&apos;t be any other way. The kind of conversations we have
with founders, we have to have in person.  We fund a dozen startups
at a time, and we can&apos;t be in a dozen places at once.  But even if
we could somehow magically save people from moving, we wouldn&apos;t.
We wouldn&apos;t be doing founders a favor by letting them stay in
Nebraska.  Places that aren&apos;t 
<a href="siliconvalley.html">startup hubs</a> are toxic to startups.
You can tell that from indirect evidence.  You can tell how hard
it must be to start a startup in Houston or Chicago or Miami from
the microscopically small number, per capita, that succeed 
there.  I don&apos;t know exactly what&apos;s suppressing all the startups in these
towns&#x2014;probably a hundred subtle little things&#x2014;but something
must be.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Maybe this will change.  Maybe the increasing cheapness of startups
will mean they&apos;ll be able to survive anywhere, instead of only in
the most hospitable environments.  Maybe 37signals is the pattern
for the future.  But maybe not.  Historically there have always
been certain towns that were centers for certain industries, and
if you weren&apos;t in one of them you were at a disadvantage.  So my
guess is that 37signals is an anomaly.  We&apos;re looking at a pattern
much older than &quot;Web 2.0&quot; here.<br><br>Perhaps the reason more startups per capita happen in the Bay Area
than Miami is simply that there are more founder-type people there.
Successful startups are almost never started by one person.  Usually
they begin with a conversation in which someone mentions that
something would be a good idea for a company, and his friend says,
&quot;Yeah, that is a good idea, let&apos;s try it.&quot;  If you&apos;re missing that
second person who says &quot;let&apos;s try it,&quot; the startup never happens.
And that is another area where undergrads have an edge.  They&apos;re
surrounded by people willing to say that.  At a good college you&apos;re
concentrated together with a lot of other ambitious and technically
minded people&#x2014;probably more concentrated than you&apos;ll ever be
again.  If your nucleus spits out a neutron, there&apos;s a good chance
it will hit another nucleus.<br><br>The number one question people ask us at Y Combinator is: Where can
I find a co-founder?  That&apos;s the biggest problem for someone starting
a startup at 30.  When they were in school they knew a lot of good
co-founders, but by 30 they&apos;ve either lost touch with them or these
people are tied down by jobs they don&apos;t want to leave.<br><br>Viaweb was an anomaly in this respect too.  Though we were comparatively
old, we weren&apos;t tied down by impressive jobs.  I was trying to be
an artist, which is not very constraining, and Robert, though 29,
was still in grad school due to a little interruption in his academic
career back in 1988.  So arguably the Worm made Viaweb possible.
Otherwise Robert would have been a junior professor at that age,
and he wouldn&apos;t have had time to work on crazy speculative projects
with me.<br><br>Most of the questions people ask Y Combinator we have some kind of
answer for, but not the co-founder question.  There is no good
answer.  Co-founders really should be people you already know.  And
by far the best place to meet them is school. You have a large
sample of smart people; you get to compare how they all perform on
identical tasks; and everyone&apos;s life is pretty fluid.  A lot of
startups grow out of schools for this reason.  Google, Yahoo, and
Microsoft, among others, were all founded by people who met in
school.  (In Microsoft&apos;s case, it was high school.)<br><br>Many students feel they should wait and get a little more experience
before they start a company.  All other things being equal, they
should.  But all other things are not quite as equal as they look.
Most students don&apos;t realize how rich they are in the scarcest
ingredient in startups, co-founders.  If you wait too long, you may
find that your friends are now involved in some project they don&apos;t
want to abandon.  The better they are, the more likely this is to
happen.<br><br>One way to mitigate this problem might be to actively plan your
startup while you&apos;re getting those n years of experience.  Sure,
go off and get jobs or go to grad school or whatever, but get
together regularly to scheme, so the idea of starting a startup
stays alive in everyone&apos;s brain.  I don&apos;t know if this works, but
it can&apos;t hurt to try.<br><br>It would be helpful just to realize what an advantage you have as
students.  Some of your classmates are probably going to be successful
startup founders; at a great technical university, that is a near
certainty.  So which ones?  If I were you I&apos;d look for the people
who are not just smart, but incurable 
<a href="http://my-computer.cruftlabs.com:8080/photos/motorcouch/0067.html">builders</a>.  <!-- It seems like the
best founders are the people who can't stop making things.  So l-->
Look
for the people who keep starting projects, and finish at least some
of them.  That&apos;s what we look for.  Above all else, above academic
credentials and even the idea you apply with, we look for people
who build things.<br><br>The other place co-founders meet is at work.  Fewer do than at
school, but there are things you can do to improve the odds.  The
most important, obviously, is to work somewhere that has a lot of
smart, young people.  Another is to work for a company located in
a startup hub.  It will be easier to talk a co-worker into quitting
with you in a place where startups are happening all around you.<br><br>You might also want to look at the employment agreement you sign
when you get hired.  Most will say that any ideas you think of while
you&apos;re employed by the company belong to them.  In practice it&apos;s
hard for anyone to prove what ideas you had when, so the line gets
drawn at code.  If you&apos;re going to start a startup, don&apos;t write any
of the code while you&apos;re still employed.  Or at least discard any
code you wrote while still employed and start over.  It&apos;s not so
much that your employer will find out and sue you.  It won&apos;t come
to that; investors or acquirers or (if you&apos;re so lucky) underwriters
will nail you first.  Between t = 0 and when you buy that yacht,
<i>someone</i> is going to ask if any of your code legally belongs
to anyone else, and you need to be able to say no.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The most overreaching employee agreement I&apos;ve seen so far is Amazon&apos;s.
In addition to the usual clauses about owning your ideas, you also
can&apos;t be a founder of a startup that has another founder who worked
at Amazon&#x2014;even if you didn&apos;t know them or even work there at the
same time. I suspect they&apos;d have a hard time enforcing this, but
it&apos;s a bad sign they even try.  There are plenty of other places
to work; you may as well choose one that keeps more of your options
open.<br><br>Speaking of cool places to work, there is of course Google.  But I
notice something slightly frightening about Google: zero startups
come out of there.  In that respect it&apos;s a black hole.  People seem
to like working at Google too much to leave.  So if you hope to start
a startup one day, the evidence so far suggests you shouldn&apos;t work
there.<br><br>I realize this seems odd advice.  If they make your life so good
that you don&apos;t want to leave, why not work there?  Because, in
effect, you&apos;re probably getting a local maximum.  You need a certain
activation energy to start a startup.  So an employer who&apos;s fairly
pleasant to work for can lull you into staying indefinitely, even
if it would be a net win for you to leave.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>The best place to work, if you want to start a startup, is probably
a startup.  In addition to being the right sort of experience, one
way or another it will be over quickly.  You&apos;ll either end up rich,
in which case problem solved, or the startup will get bought, in
which case it it will start to suck to work there and it will be
easy to leave, or most likely, the thing will blow up and you&apos;ll
be free again.<br><br>Your final advantage, ignorance, may not sound very useful.  I
deliberately used a controversial word for it; you might equally
call it innocence.  But it seems to be a powerful force.  My Y
Combinator co-founder Jessica Livingston is just about to publish
a book of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597141">interviews</a>
with startup founders, and I noticed a remarkable pattern in them.
One after another said that if they&apos;d known how hard it would be,
they would have been too intimidated to start.<br><br>Ignorance can be useful when it&apos;s a counterweight to other forms
of stupidity.  It&apos;s useful in starting startups because you&apos;re
capable of more than you realize.  Starting startups is harder than
you expect, but you&apos;re also capable of more than you expect, so
they balance out.<br><br>Most people look at a company like Apple and think, how could I
ever make such a thing?  Apple is an institution, and I&apos;m just a
person.  But every institution was at one point just a handful of
people in a room deciding to start something.  Institutions are
made up, and made up by people no different from you.<br><br>I&apos;m not saying everyone could start a startup.  I&apos;m sure most people
couldn&apos;t; I don&apos;t know much about the population at large.  When
you get to groups I know well, like hackers, I can say more precisely.
At the top schools, I&apos;d guess as many as a quarter of the CS majors
could make it as startup founders if they wanted.<br><br>That &quot;if they wanted&quot; is an important qualification&#x2014;so important
that it&apos;s almost cheating to append it like that&#x2014;because once you
get over a certain threshold of intelligence, which most CS majors
at top schools are past, the deciding factor in whether you succeed
as a founder is how much you want to.  You don&apos;t have to be that
smart.  If you&apos;re not a genius, just start a startup in some unsexy
field where you&apos;ll have less competition, like software for human
resources departments.  I picked that example at random, but I feel
safe in predicting that whatever they have now, it wouldn&apos;t take
genius to do better.   There are a lot of people out there working
on boring stuff who are desperately in need of better software, so
however short you think you fall of Larry and Sergey, you can ratchet
down the coolness of the idea far enough to compensate.<br><br>As well as preventing you from being intimidated, ignorance can
sometimes help you discover new ideas.  <a href="http://foundersatwork.com/stevewozniak.html">Steve Wozniak</a>
put this very strongly:
<blockquote>
  All the best things that I did at Apple came from (a) not having
  money and (b) not having done it before, ever. Every single thing
  that we came out with that was really great, I&apos;d never once done
  that thing in my life.
</blockquote>
When you know nothing, you have to reinvent stuff for yourself, and
if you&apos;re smart your reinventions may be better than what preceded
them.  This is especially true in fields where the rules change.
All our ideas about software were developed in a time when processors
were slow, and memories and disks were tiny.  Who knows what obsolete
assumptions are embedded in the conventional wisdom?  And the way
these assumptions are going to get fixed is not by explicitly
deallocating them, but by something more akin to garbage collection.
Someone ignorant but smart will come along and reinvent everything,
and in the process simply fail to reproduce certain existing ideas.<br><br><b>Minus</b><br><br>So much for the advantages of young founders.  What about the
disadvantages? I&apos;m going to start with what goes wrong and try to
trace it back to the root causes.<br><br>What goes wrong with young founders is that they build stuff that
looks like class projects.  It was only recently that we figured
this out ourselves.  We noticed a lot of similarities between the
startups that seemed to be falling behind, but we couldn&apos;t figure
out how to put it into words.  Then finally we realized what it
was: they were building class projects.<br><br>But what does that really mean?  What&apos;s wrong with class projects?
What&apos;s the difference between a class project and a real startup?
If we could answer that question it would be useful not just to
would-be startup founders but to students in general, because we&apos;d
be a long way toward explaining the mystery of the so-called real
world.<br><br>There seem to be two big things missing in class projects: (1) an
iterative definition of a real problem and (2) intensity.<br><br>The first is probably unavoidable.  Class projects will inevitably
solve fake problems.  For one thing, real problems are rare and
valuable.  If a professor wanted to have students solve real problems,
he&apos;d face the same paradox as someone trying to give an example of
whatever &quot;paradigm&quot; might succeed the Standard Model of physics.
There may well be something that does, but if you could think of
an example you&apos;d be entitled to the Nobel Prize.  Similarly, good
new problems are not to be had for the asking.<br><br>In technology the difficulty is compounded by the fact that real
startups tend to discover the problem they&apos;re solving by a process
of evolution.  Someone has an idea for something; they build it;
and in doing so (and probably only by doing so) they realize
the problem they should be solving is another one.  Even if the
professor let you change your project description on the fly, there
isn&apos;t time enough to do that in a college class, or a market to
supply evolutionary pressures.  So class
projects are mostly about implementation, which is the least
of your problems in a startup.<br><br>It&apos;s not just that in a startup you work on the idea as well as
implementation.  The very implementation is different.  Its main
purpose is to refine the idea.  Often the only value of most of the
stuff you build in the first six months is that it proves your
initial idea was mistaken.  And that&apos;s extremely valuable.  If
you&apos;re free of a misconception that everyone else still shares,
you&apos;re in a powerful position.  But you&apos;re not thinking that way
about a class project.  Proving your initial plan was mistaken would
just get you a bad grade.  Instead of building stuff to throw away,
you tend to want every line of code to go toward that final goal
of showing you did a lot of work.<br><br>That leads to our second difference: the way class projects are
measured.  Professors will tend to judge you by the distance between
the starting point and where you are now.  If someone has achieved
a lot, they should get a good grade.  But customers will judge you
from the other direction: the distance remaining between where you
are now and the features they need.  The market doesn&apos;t give a shit
how hard you worked.  Users just want your software to do what they
need, and you get a zero otherwise.  That is one of the most
distinctive differences between school and the real world: there
is no reward for putting in a good effort.  In fact, the whole
concept of a &quot;good effort&quot; is a fake idea adults invented to encourage
kids.  It is not found in nature.<br><br>Such lies seem to be helpful to kids.  But unfortunately when you
graduate they don&apos;t give you a list of all the lies they told you
during your education.  You have to get them beaten out of you by
contact with the real world.  And this is why so many jobs want
work experience.  I couldn&apos;t understand that when I was in college.
I knew how to program.  In fact, I could tell I knew how to program
better than most people doing it for a living.  So what was this
mysterious &quot;work experience&quot; and why did I need it?<br><br>Now I know what it is, and part of the confusion is grammatical.
Describing it as &quot;work experience&quot; implies it&apos;s like experience
operating a certain kind of machine, or using a certain programming
language.  But really what work experience refers to is not some
specific expertise, but the elimination of certain habits left over
from childhood.<br><br>One of the defining qualities of kids is that they flake.  When
you&apos;re a kid and you face some hard test, you can cry and say &quot;I
can&apos;t&quot; and they won&apos;t make you do it.  Of course, no one can make
you do anything in the grownup world either.  What they do instead
is fire you.  And when motivated by that
you find you can do a lot more than you realized.  So one of the
things employers expect from someone with &quot;work experience&quot; is the
elimination of the flake reflex&#x2014;the ability to get things done,
with no excuses.<br><br>The other thing you get from work experience is an understanding
of what work is, and in particular, how intrinsically horrible it
is.  Fundamentally the equation is a brutal one: you have to spend
most of your waking hours doing stuff someone else wants, or starve.
There are a few places where the work is so interesting that this
is concealed, because what other people want done happens to coincide
with what you want to work on.  But you only have to imagine what
would happen if they diverged to see the underlying reality.<br><br>It&apos;s not so much that adults lie to kids about this as never explain
it.  They never explain what the deal is with money.  You know from
an early age that you&apos;ll have some sort of job, because everyone
asks what you&apos;re going to &quot;be&quot; when you grow up. What they
don&apos;t tell you is that as a kid you&apos;re sitting on the shoulders of
someone else who&apos;s treading water, and that starting working means
you get thrown into the water on your own, and have to start treading
water yourself or sink.  &quot;Being&quot; something is incidental; the
immediate problem is not to drown.<br><br>The relationship between work and money tends to dawn on you only
gradually.  At least it did for me.  One&apos;s first thought tends to
be simply &quot;This sucks.  I&apos;m in debt. Plus I have to get up on monday
and go to work.&quot;  Gradually you realize that these two things are
as tightly connected as only a market can make them.<br><br>So the most important advantage 24 year old founders have over 20
year old founders is that they know what they&apos;re trying to avoid.
To the average undergrad the idea of getting rich translates into
buying Ferraris, or being admired.  To someone who has learned from
experience about the relationship between money and work, it
translates to something way more important: it means you get to opt
out of the brutal equation that governs the lives of 99.9% of people.
Getting rich means you can stop treading water.<br><br>Someone who gets this will work much harder at making a startup
succeed&#x2014;with the proverbial energy of a drowning man, in fact.
But understanding the relationship between money and work also
changes the way you work.  You don&apos;t get money just for working,
but for doing things other people want.  Someone who&apos;s figured that
out will automatically focus more on the user.  And that cures the
other half of the class-project syndrome.  After you&apos;ve been working
for a while, you yourself tend to measure what you&apos;ve done the same
way the market does.<br><br>Of course, you don&apos;t have to spend years working to learn this
stuff.  If you&apos;re sufficiently perceptive you can grasp these things
while you&apos;re still in school.  Sam Altman did.  He must have, because
Loopt is no class project.  And as his example suggests, this can
be valuable knowledge.  At a minimum, if you get this stuff, you
already have most of what you gain from the &quot;work experience&quot;
employers consider so desirable.  But of course if you really get
it, you can use this information in a way that&apos;s more valuable to
you than that.<br><br><b>Now</b><br><br>So suppose you think you might start a startup at some point, either
when you graduate or a few years after.  What should you do now?
For both jobs and grad school, there are ways to prepare while
you&apos;re in college.  If you want to get a job when you graduate, you
should get summer jobs at places you&apos;d like to work.  If you want
to go to grad school, it will help to work on research projects as
an undergrad.  What&apos;s the equivalent for startups?  How do you keep
your options maximally open?<br><br>One thing you can do while you&apos;re still in school is to learn how
startups work.  Unfortunately that&apos;s not easy.  Few if any colleges
have classes about startups.  There may be business school classes
on entrepreneurship, as they call it over there, but these are
likely to be a waste of time.  Business schools like to talk about
startups, but philosophically they&apos;re at the opposite end of the
spectrum.  Most books on startups also seem to be useless.  I&apos;ve
looked at a few and none get it right.  Books in most fields are
written by people who know the subject from experience, but for
startups there&apos;s a unique problem:  by definition the founders of
successful startups don&apos;t need to write books to make money. As a
result most books on the subject end up being written by people who
don&apos;t understand it.<br><br>So I&apos;d be skeptical of classes and books.  The way to learn about
startups is by watching them in action, preferably by working at
one.  How do you do that as an undergrad?  Probably by sneaking in
through the back door. Just hang around a lot and gradually start
doing things for them.  Most startups are (or should be) very
cautious about hiring.  Every hire increases the burn rate, and bad
hires early on are hard to recover from.  However, startups usually
have a fairly informal atmosphere, and there&apos;s always a lot that
needs to be done.  If you just start doing stuff for them, many
will be too busy to shoo you away.  You can thus gradually work
your way into their confidence, and maybe turn it into an official
job later, or not, whichever you prefer.  This won&apos;t work for all
startups, but it would work for most I&apos;ve known.<br><br>Number two, make the most of the great advantage of school: the
wealth of co-founders.  Look at the people around you and ask
yourself which you&apos;d like to work with.  When you apply that test,
you may find you get surprising results.  You may find you&apos;d prefer
the quiet guy you&apos;ve mostly ignored to someone who seems impressive
but has an attitude to match.  I&apos;m not suggesting you suck up to
people you don&apos;t really like because you think one day they&apos;ll be
successful.  Exactly the opposite, in fact: you should only start
a startup with someone you like, because a startup will put your
friendship through a stress test.  I&apos;m just saying you should think
about who you really admire and hang out with them, instead of
whoever circumstances throw you together with.<br><br>Another thing you can do is learn skills that will be useful to you
in a startup.  These may be different from the skills you&apos;d learn
to get a job.  For example, thinking about getting a job will make
you want to learn programming languages you think employers want,
like Java and C++.  Whereas if you start a startup, you get to pick
the language, so you have to think about which will actually let
you get the most done.  If you use that test you might end up
learning Ruby or Python instead.<br><br><!--More generally, you'll find that you have to start thinking about
being good instead of looking good.  That could be a liberating
idea for college students, most of whom, especially at the top
schools, have spent so long jumping through artificial hoops that
it has started to affect even the way they judge themselves.
Instead of focusing on getting good grades, for example, you'll
tend to focus on actually learning stuff.  In a startup your boss
is the customer, and they don't care what grades you got.  All they
care about is whether you can build stuff that works.
-->
But the most important skill for a startup founder isn&apos;t a programming
technique.  It&apos;s a knack for understanding users and figuring out
how to give them what they want.  I know I repeat this, but that&apos;s
because it&apos;s so important.  And it&apos;s a skill you can learn, though
perhaps habit might be a better word.  Get into the habit of thinking
of software as having users.  What do those users want?  What would
make them say wow?<br><br>This is particularly valuable for undergrads, because the concept
of users is missing from most college programming classes.  The way
you get taught programming in college would be like teaching writing
as grammar, without mentioning that its purpose is to communicate
something to an audience.  Fortunately an audience for software is
now only an http request away.  So in addition to the programming
you do for your classes, why not build some kind of website people
will find useful?  At the very least it will teach you how to write
software with users.  In the best case, it might not just be
preparation for a startup, but the startup itself, like it was for
Yahoo and Google.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]

<p>
October 2006<br><br>In the Q &amp; A period after a recent talk, someone asked what made
startups fail.  After standing there gaping for a few seconds I
realized this was kind of a trick question.  It&apos;s equivalent to
asking how to make a startup succeed&#x2014;if you avoid every cause of
failure, you succeed&#x2014;and that&apos;s too big a question to answer on
the fly.<br><br>Afterwards I realized it could be helpful to look at the problem
from this direction.  If you have a list of all the things you
shouldn&apos;t do, you can turn that into a recipe for succeeding just
by negating.  And this form of list may be more useful in practice.
It&apos;s easier to catch yourself doing something you shouldn&apos;t than
always to remember to do something you should.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>In a sense there&apos;s just one mistake that kills startups: not making
something users want.  If you make something users want, you&apos;ll
probably be fine, whatever else you do or don&apos;t do.  And if you
don&apos;t make something users want, then you&apos;re dead, whatever else
you do or don&apos;t do.  So really this is a list of 18 things that
cause startups not to make something users want.  Nearly all failure
funnels through that.<br><br><b>1. Single Founder</b><br><br>Have you ever noticed how few successful startups were founded by
just one person?  Even companies you think of as having one founder,
like Oracle, usually turn out to have more.  It seems unlikely this
is a coincidence.<br><br>What&apos;s wrong with having one founder?  To start with, it&apos;s a vote
of no confidence.  It probably means the founder couldn&apos;t talk any
of his friends into starting the company with him.  That&apos;s pretty
alarming, because his friends are the ones who know him best.<br><br>But even if the founder&apos;s friends were all wrong and the company
is a good bet, he&apos;s still at a disadvantage.  Starting a startup
is too hard for one person.  Even if you could do all the work
yourself, you need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you out
of stupid decisions, and to cheer you up when things go wrong.<br><br>The last one might be the most important.  The low points in a
startup are so low that few could bear them alone.  When you have
multiple founders, esprit de corps binds them together in a way
that seems to violate conservation laws.  Each thinks &quot;I can&apos;t let
my friends down.&quot;  This is one of the most powerful forces in human
nature, and it&apos;s missing when there&apos;s just one founder.<br><br><b>2. Bad Location</b><br><br>Startups prosper in some places and not others.  Silicon Valley
dominates, then Boston, then Seattle, Austin, Denver, and New York.  After
that there&apos;s not much.  Even in New York the number of startups per
capita is probably a 20th of what it is in Silicon Valley.  In towns
like Houston and Chicago and Detroit it&apos;s too small to measure.<br><br>Why is the falloff so sharp?  Probably for the same reason it is
in other industries.  What&apos;s the sixth largest fashion center in
the US?  The sixth largest center for oil, or finance, or publishing?
Whatever they are they&apos;re probably so far from the top that it would
be misleading even to call them centers.<br><br>It&apos;s an interesting question why cities 
<a href="siliconvalley.html">become</a> startup hubs, but
the reason startups prosper in them is probably the same as it is
for any industry: that&apos;s where the experts are.  Standards are
higher; people are more sympathetic to what you&apos;re doing; the kind
of people you want to hire want to live there; supporting industries
are there; the people you run into in chance meetings are in the
same business.  Who knows exactly how these factors combine to boost
startups in Silicon Valley and squish them in Detroit, but it&apos;s
clear they do from the number of startups per capita in each.<br><br><b>3. Marginal Niche</b><br><br>Most of the groups that apply to Y Combinator suffer from a common
problem: choosing a small, obscure niche in the hope of avoiding
competition.<br><br>If you watch little kids playing sports, you notice that below a
certain age they&apos;re afraid of the ball.  When the ball comes near
them their instinct is to avoid it.  I didn&apos;t make a lot of catches
as an eight year old outfielder, because whenever a fly ball came
my way, I used to close my eyes and hold my glove up more for
protection than in the hope of catching it.<br><br>Choosing a marginal project is the startup equivalent of my eight
year old strategy for dealing with fly balls.  If you make anything
good, you&apos;re going to have competitors, so you may as well face
that.  You can only avoid competition by avoiding good ideas.<br><br>I think this shrinking from big problems is mostly unconscious.
It&apos;s not that people think of grand ideas but decide to pursue
smaller ones because they seem safer.  Your unconscious won&apos;t even
let you think of grand ideas.  So the solution may be to think about
ideas without involving yourself.  What would be a great idea for
<i>someone else</i> to do as a startup?<br><br><b>4. Derivative Idea</b><br><br>Many of the applications we get are imitations of some existing
company.  That&apos;s one source of ideas, but not the best.  If you
look at the origins of successful startups, few were started in
imitation of some other startup.  Where did they get their ideas?
Usually from some specific, unsolved problem the founders identified.<br><br>Our startup made software for making online stores.  When we started
it, there wasn&apos;t any; the few sites you could order from were
hand-made at great expense by web consultants.  We knew that if
online shopping ever took off, these sites would have to be generated
by software, so we wrote some.  Pretty straightforward.<br><br>It seems like the best problems to solve are ones that affect you
personally.  Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a computer,
Google because Larry and Sergey couldn&apos;t find stuff online, Hotmail
because Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith couldn&apos;t exchange email at
work.<br><br>So instead of copying the Facebook, with some variation that the
Facebook rightly ignored, look for ideas from the other direction.
Instead of starting from companies and working back to the problems
they solved, look for problems and imagine the company that might
solve them. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>
What do people complain about?  What do you wish there was?<br><br><b>5. Obstinacy</b><br><br>In some fields the way to succeed is to have a vision of what you
want to achieve, and to hold true to it no matter what setbacks you
encounter.  Starting startups is not one of them.  The stick-to-your-vision
approach works for something like winning an Olympic gold medal,
where the problem is well-defined.  Startups are more like science,
where you need to follow the trail wherever it leads.<br><br>So don&apos;t get too attached to your original plan, because it&apos;s
probably wrong.  Most successful startups end up doing something
different than they originally intended&#x2014;often so different that
it doesn&apos;t even seem like the same company.  You have to be prepared
to see the better idea when it arrives.  And the hardest part of
that is often discarding your old idea.<br><br>But openness to new ideas has to be tuned just right.  Switching
to a new idea every week will be equally fatal.  Is there some kind
of external test you can use?  One is to ask whether the ideas
represent some kind of progression.  If in each new idea you&apos;re
able to re-use most of what you built for the previous ones, then
you&apos;re probably in a process that converges.  Whereas if you keep
restarting from scratch, that&apos;s a bad sign.<br><br>Fortunately there&apos;s someone you can ask for advice: your users.  If
you&apos;re thinking about turning in some new direction and your users
seem excited about it, it&apos;s probably a good bet.<br><br><b>6. Hiring Bad Programmers</b><br><br>I forgot to include this in the early versions of the list,
because nearly all the founders I know are programmers.  This is
not a serious problem for them.  They might accidentally hire someone
bad, but it&apos;s not going to kill the company.  In a pinch they can
do whatever&apos;s required themselves.<br><br>But when I think about what killed most of the startups in the
e-commerce business back in the 90s, it was bad programmers.  A lot
of those companies were started by business guys who thought the
way startups worked was that you had some clever idea and then hired
programmers to implement it.  That&apos;s actually much harder than it
sounds&#x2014;almost impossibly hard in fact&#x2014;because business guys
can&apos;t tell which are the good programmers.  They don&apos;t even get a
shot at the best ones, because no one really good wants a job
implementing the vision of a business guy.<br><br>In practice what happens is that the business guys choose people
they think are good programmers (it says here on his resume that
he&apos;s a Microsoft Certified Developer) but who aren&apos;t.  Then they&apos;re
mystified to find that their startup lumbers along like a World War
II bomber while their competitors scream past like jet fighters.
This kind of startup is in the same position as a big company,
but without the advantages.<br><br>So how do you pick good programmers if you&apos;re not a programmer?  I
don&apos;t think there&apos;s an answer.  I was about to say you&apos;d have to
find a good programmer to help you hire people.  But if you can&apos;t
recognize good programmers, how would you even do that?<br><br><b>7. Choosing the Wrong Platform</b><br><br>A related problem (since it tends to be done by bad programmers)
is choosing the wrong platform.  For example, I think a lot of
startups during the Bubble killed themselves by deciding to build
server-based applications on Windows.  Hotmail was still running
on FreeBSD for years after Microsoft bought it, presumably because
Windows couldn&apos;t handle the load.  If Hotmail&apos;s founders
had chosen to use Windows, they would have been swamped.<br><br>PayPal only just dodged this bullet.  After they merged with X.com,
the new CEO wanted to switch to Windows&#x2014;even after PayPal cofounder
Max Levchin showed that their software scaled only 1% as well on
Windows as Unix.  Fortunately for PayPal they switched CEOs instead.<br><br>Platform is a vague word.  It could mean an operating system, or a
programming language, or a &quot;framework&quot; built on top of a programming
language.  It implies something that both supports and limits, like
the foundation of a house.<br><br>The scary thing about platforms is that there are always some that
seem to outsiders to be fine, responsible choices and yet, like
Windows in the 90s, will destroy you if you choose them.  Java
applets were probably the most spectacular example.  This was
supposed to be the new way of delivering applications.  Presumably
it killed just about 100% of the startups who believed that.<br><br>How do you pick the right platforms?  The usual way is to hire good
programmers and let them choose.  But there is a trick you could
use if you&apos;re not a programmer: visit a top computer science
department and see what they use in research projects.<br><br><b>8. Slowness in Launching</b><br><br>Companies of all sizes have a hard time getting software done.  It&apos;s
intrinsic to the medium; software is always 85% done.  It takes an
effort of will to push through this and get something released to
users.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Startups make all kinds of excuses for delaying their launch.  Most
are equivalent to the ones people use for procrastinating in everyday
life.  There&apos;s something that needs to happen first.  Maybe.  But
if the software were 100% finished and ready to launch at the push
of a button, would they still be waiting?<br><br>One reason to launch quickly is that it forces you to actually
<i>finish</i> some quantum of work.  Nothing is truly finished till it&apos;s
released; you can see that from the rush of work that&apos;s always
involved in releasing anything, no matter how finished you thought
it was.  The other reason you need to launch is that it&apos;s only by
bouncing your idea off users that you fully understand it.<br><br>Several distinct problems manifest themselves as delays in launching:
working too slowly; not truly understanding the problem; fear of
having to deal with users; fear of being judged; working on too
many different things; excessive perfectionism.  Fortunately you
can combat all of them by the simple expedient of forcing yourself
to launch <i>something</i> fairly quickly.<br><br><b>9. Launching Too Early</b><br><br>Launching too slowly has probably killed a hundred times more
startups than launching too fast, but it is possible to launch too
fast.  The danger here is that you ruin your reputation.  You launch
something, the early adopters try it out, and if it&apos;s no good they
may never come back.<br><br>So what&apos;s the minimum you need to launch?  We suggest startups think
about what they plan to do, identify a core that&apos;s both (a) useful
on its own and (b) something that can be incrementally expanded
into the whole project, and then get that done as soon as possible.<br><br>This is the same approach I (and many other programmers) use for
writing software.  Think about the overall goal, then start by
writing the smallest subset of it that does anything useful.  If
it&apos;s a subset, you&apos;ll have to write it anyway, so in the worst case
you won&apos;t be wasting your time.  But more likely you&apos;ll find that
implementing a working subset is both good for morale and helps you
see more clearly what the rest should do.<br><br>The early adopters you need to impress are fairly tolerant.  They
don&apos;t expect a newly launched product to do everything; it just has
to do <i>something</i>.<br><br><b>10. Having No Specific User in Mind</b><br><br>You can&apos;t build things users like without understanding them.  I
mentioned earlier that the most successful startups seem to have
begun by trying to solve a problem their founders had.  Perhaps
there&apos;s a rule here: perhaps you create wealth in proportion to how
well you understand the problem you&apos;re solving, and the problems
you understand best are your own. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>That&apos;s just a theory.  What&apos;s not a theory is the converse: if
you&apos;re trying to solve problems you don&apos;t understand, you&apos;re hosed.<br><br>And yet a surprising number of founders seem willing to
assume that someone, they&apos;re not sure exactly who, will want what
they&apos;re building.  Do the founders want it?  No, they&apos;re not the
target market.  Who is?  Teenagers.  People interested in local
events (that one is a perennial tarpit).  Or &quot;business&quot; users.  What
business users?  Gas stations?  Movie studios?  Defense contractors?<br><br>You can of course build something for users other than yourself.
We did.  But you should realize you&apos;re stepping into dangerous
territory.  You&apos;re flying on instruments, in effect, so you should
(a) consciously shift gears, instead of assuming you can rely on
your intuitions as you ordinarily would, and (b) look at the
instruments.<br><br>In this case the instruments are the users.  When designing for
other people you have to be empirical.  You can no longer guess
what will work; you have to find users and measure their responses.
So if you&apos;re going to make something for teenagers or &quot;business&quot;
users or some other group that doesn&apos;t include you, you have to be
able to talk some specific ones into using what you&apos;re making.  If
you can&apos;t, you&apos;re on the wrong track.<br><br><b>11. Raising Too Little Money</b><br><br>Most successful startups take funding at some point.  Like having
more than one founder, it seems a good bet statistically.  How much
should you take, though?<br><br>Startup funding is measured in time.  Every startup that isn&apos;t
profitable (meaning nearly all of them, initially) has a certain
amount of time left before the money runs out and they have to stop.
This is sometimes referred to as runway, as in &quot;How much runway do
you have left?&quot;  It&apos;s a good metaphor because it reminds you that
when the money runs out you&apos;re going to be airborne or dead.<br><br>Too little money means not enough to get airborne.  What airborne
means depends on the situation.  Usually you have to advance to a
visibly higher level: if all you have is an idea, a working prototype;
if you have a prototype, launching; if you&apos;re launched, significant
growth.  It depends on investors, because until you&apos;re profitable
that&apos;s who you have to convince.<br><br>So if you take money from investors, you have to take enough to get
to the next step, whatever that is.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font>
Fortunately you have some
control over both how much you spend and what the next step is.  We
advise startups to set both low, initially: spend practically
nothing, and make your initial goal simply to build a solid prototype.
This gives you maximum flexibility.<br><br><b>12. Spending Too Much</b><br><br>It&apos;s hard to distinguish spending too much from raising too little.
If you run out of money, you could say either was the cause.  The
only way to decide which to call it is by comparison with other
startups.  If you raised five million and ran out of money, you
probably spent too much.<br><br>Burning through too much money is not as common as it used to be.
Founders seem to have learned that lesson.  Plus it keeps getting
cheaper to start a startup.  So as of this writing few startups
spend too much.  None of the ones we&apos;ve funded have.  (And not just
because we make small investments; many have gone on to raise further
rounds.)<br><br>The classic way to burn through cash is by hiring a lot of people.
This bites you twice: in addition to increasing your costs, it slows
you down&#x2014;so money that&apos;s getting consumed faster has to last
longer.  Most hackers understand why that happens; Fred Brooks
explained it in The Mythical Man-Month.<br><br>We have three general suggestions about hiring: (a) don&apos;t do it if
you can avoid it, (b) pay people with equity rather than salary,
not just to save money, but because you want the kind of people who
are committed enough to prefer that, and (c) only hire people who
are either going to write code or go out and get users, because
those are the only things you need at first.<br><br><b>13. Raising Too Much Money</b><br><br>It&apos;s obvious how too little money could kill you, but is there such
a thing as having too much?<br><br>Yes and no.  The problem is not so much the money itself as what
comes with it.  As one VC who spoke at Y Combinator said, &quot;Once you
take several million dollars of my money, the clock is ticking.&quot;
If VCs fund you, they&apos;re not going to let you just put the money
in the bank and keep operating as two guys living on ramen.  They
want that money to go to work. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font>
At the very least you&apos;ll move
into proper office space and hire more people.  That will change
the atmosphere, and not entirely for the better.  Now most of your
people will be employees rather than founders. They won&apos;t be as
committed; they&apos;ll need to be told what to do; they&apos;ll start to
engage in office politics.<br><br>When you raise a lot of money, your company moves to the suburbs
and has kids.<br><br>Perhaps more dangerously, once you take a lot of money it gets
harder to change direction.  Suppose your initial plan was to sell
something to companies.  After taking VC money you hire a sales
force to do that. What happens now if you realize you should be
making this for consumers instead of businesses?  That&apos;s a completely
different kind of selling.  What happens, in practice, is that you
don&apos;t realize that.  The more people you have, the more you stay
pointed in the same direction.<br><br>Another drawback of large investments is the time they take.  The
time required to raise money grows with the amount.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font>
When the
amount rises into the millions, investors get very cautious.  VCs
never quite say yes or no; they just engage you in an apparently
endless conversation.  Raising VC scale investments is thus a huge
time sink&#x2014;more work, probably, than the startup itself.   And you
don&apos;t want to be spending all your time talking to investors while
your competitors are spending theirs building things.<br><br>We advise founders who go on to seek VC money to take the first
reasonable deal they get.  If you get an offer from a reputable
firm at a reasonable valuation with no unusually onerous terms,
just take it and get on with building the company.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font>
Who cares
if you could get a 30% better deal elsewhere?  Economically, startups
are an all-or-nothing game.  Bargain-hunting among investors is a
waste of time.<br><br><b>14. Poor Investor Management</b><br><br>As a founder, you have to manage your investors.  You shouldn&apos;t
ignore them, because they may have useful insights.  But neither
should you let them run the company.  That&apos;s supposed to be your
job.  If investors had sufficient vision to run the companies
they fund, why didn&apos;t they start them?<br><br>Pissing off investors by ignoring them is probably less dangerous
than caving in to them.  In our startup, we erred on the ignoring
side.  A lot of our energy got drained
away in disputes with investors instead of going into the product.
But this was less costly than giving in, which would probably have
destroyed the company.  If the founders know what they&apos;re doing,
it&apos;s better to have half their attention focused on the product
than the full attention of investors who don&apos;t.<br><br>How hard you have to work on managing investors usually depends on
how much money you&apos;ve taken.  When you raise VC-scale money, the
investors get a great deal of control.  If they have a board majority,
they&apos;re literally your bosses.  In the more common case, where
founders and investors are equally represented and the deciding
vote is cast by neutral outside directors, all the investors have
to do is convince the outside directors and they control the company.<br><br>If things go well, this shouldn&apos;t matter.  So long as you seem to
be advancing rapidly, most investors will leave you alone.  But
things don&apos;t always go smoothly in startups.  Investors have made
trouble even for the most successful companies.  One of the most
famous examples is Apple, whose board made a nearly fatal blunder
in firing Steve Jobs.  Apparently even Google got a lot of grief
from their investors early on.<br><br><b>15. Sacrificing Users to (Supposed) Profit</b><br><br>When I said at the beginning that if you make something users want,
you&apos;ll be fine, you may have noticed I didn&apos;t mention anything about
having the right business model.  That&apos;s not because making money
is unimportant.  I&apos;m not suggesting that founders start companies
with no chance of making money in the hope of unloading them before
they tank.  The reason we tell founders not to worry about the
business model initially is that making something people want is
so much harder.<br><br>I don&apos;t know why it&apos;s so hard to make something people want.  It
seems like it should be straightforward.  But you can tell it must
be hard by how few startups do it.<br><br>Because making something people want is so much harder than making
money from it, you should leave business models for later, just as
you&apos;d leave some trivial but messy feature for version 2.  In version
1, solve the core problem.  And the core problem in a startup is
how to <a href="wealth.html">create wealth</a> 
(= how much people want something x the number
who want it), not how to convert that wealth into money.<br><br>The companies that win are the ones that put users first.  Google,
for example.  They made search work, then worried about how to make
money from it.  And yet some startup founders still think it&apos;s
irresponsible not to focus on the business model from the beginning.
They&apos;re often encouraged in this by investors whose experience comes
from less malleable industries.<br><br>It <i>is</i> irresponsible not to think about business models.  It&apos;s
just ten times more irresponsible not to think about the product.<br><br><b>16. Not Wanting to Get Your Hands Dirty</b><br><br>Nearly all programmers would rather spend their time writing code
and have someone else handle the messy business of extracting money
from it.  And not just the lazy ones.  Larry and Sergey apparently
felt this way too at first.  After developing their new search
algorithm, the first thing they tried was to get some other company
to buy it.<br><br>Start a company?  Yech.  Most hackers would rather just have ideas.
But as Larry and Sergey found, there&apos;s not much of a market for
ideas.  No one trusts an idea till you embody it in a product and
use that to grow a user base.  Then they&apos;ll pay big time.<br><br>Maybe this will change, but I doubt it will change much.  There&apos;s
nothing like users for convincing acquirers.  It&apos;s not just that
the risk is decreased.  The acquirers are human, and they have a
hard time paying a bunch of young guys millions of dollars just for
being clever.  When the idea is embodied in a company with a lot
of users, they can tell themselves they&apos;re buying the users rather
than the cleverness, and this is easier for them to swallow.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you&apos;re going to attract users, you&apos;ll probably have to get up
from your computer and go find some.  It&apos;s unpleasant work, but if
you can make yourself do it you have a much greater chance of
succeeding.  In the first batch of startups we funded, in the summer
of 2005, most of the founders spent all their time building their
applications.  But there was one who was away half the time talking
to executives at cell phone companies, trying to arrange deals.
Can you imagine anything more painful for a hacker?
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#777777">10</font></a>]</font>
But it
paid off, because this startup seems the most successful of that
group by an order of magnitude.<br><br>If you want to start a startup, you have to face the fact that you
can&apos;t just hack.  At least one hacker will have to spend some of
the time doing business stuff.<br><br><b>17. Fights Between Founders</b><br><br>Fights between founders are surprisingly common.  About 20% of the
startups we&apos;ve funded have had a founder leave.  It happens so often
that we&apos;ve reversed our attitude to vesting.  We still don&apos;t require
it, but now we advise founders to vest so there will be an orderly
way for people to quit.<br><br>A founder leaving doesn&apos;t necessarily kill a startup, though.  Plenty
of successful startups have had that happen. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#777777">11</font></a>]</font>
Fortunately it&apos;s
usually the least committed founder who leaves.  If there are three
founders and one who was lukewarm leaves, big deal.  If you have
two and one leaves, or a guy with critical technical skills leaves,
that&apos;s more of a problem.  But even that is survivable.  Blogger
got down to one person, and they bounced back.<br><br>Most of the disputes I&apos;ve seen between founders could have been
avoided if they&apos;d been more careful about who they started a company
with.  Most disputes are not due to the situation but the people.
Which means they&apos;re inevitable.  And most founders who&apos;ve been
burned by such disputes probably had misgivings, which they suppressed,
when they started the company.  Don&apos;t suppress misgivings.  It&apos;s
much easier to fix problems before the company is started than
after.  So don&apos;t include your housemate in your startup because
he&apos;d feel left out otherwise.  Don&apos;t start a company with someone
you dislike because they have some skill you need and you worry you
won&apos;t find anyone else.  The people are the most important ingredient
in a startup, so don&apos;t compromise there.<br><br><b>18. A Half-Hearted Effort</b><br><br>The failed startups you hear most about are the spectactular
flameouts.  Those are actually the elite of failures.  The most
common type is not the one that makes spectacular mistakes, but the
one that doesn&apos;t do much of anything&#x2014;the one we never even hear
about, because it was some project a couple guys started on the
side while working on their day jobs, but which never got anywhere
and was gradually abandoned.<br><br>Statistically, if you want to avoid failure, it would seem like the
most important thing is to quit your day job.  Most founders of
failed startups don&apos;t quit their day jobs, and most founders of
successful ones do.  If startup failure were a disease, the CDC
would be issuing bulletins warning people to avoid day jobs.<br><br>Does that mean you should quit your day job?  Not necessarily.  I&apos;m
guessing here, but I&apos;d guess that many of these would-be founders
may not have the kind of determination it takes to start a company,
and that in the back of their minds, they know it.  The reason they
don&apos;t invest more time in their startup is that they know it&apos;s a
bad investment.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#777777">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>I&apos;d also guess there&apos;s some band of people who could have succeeded
if they&apos;d taken the leap and done it full-time, but didn&apos;t. I have
no idea how wide this band is, but if the winner/borderline/hopeless
progression has the sort of distribution you&apos;d expect, the number
of people who could have made it, if they&apos;d quit their day job, is
probably an order of magnitude larger than the number who do make
it.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#777777">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>If that&apos;s true, most startups that could succeed fail because the
founders don&apos;t devote their whole efforts to them.  That certainly
accords with what I see out in the world.  Most startups fail because
they don&apos;t make something people want, and the reason most don&apos;t
is that they don&apos;t try hard enough.<br><br>In other words, starting startups is just like everything else.
The biggest mistake you can make is not to try hard enough.  To the
extent there&apos;s a secret to success, it&apos;s not to be in denial about
that.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This is not a complete list of the causes of failure,
just those you can control.  There are also several you can&apos;t,
notably ineptitude and bad luck.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Ironically, one variant of the Facebook that might work is a
facebook exclusively for college students.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Steve Jobs tried to motivate people by saying &quot;Real artists
ship.&quot;  This is a fine sentence, but unfortunately not true.  Many
famous works of art are unfinished.  It&apos;s true in fields that have
hard deadlines, like architecture and filmmaking, but even there
people tend to be tweaking stuff till it&apos;s yanked out of their
hands.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
There&apos;s probably also a second factor: startup founders tend
to be at the leading edge of technology, so problems they face are
probably especially valuable.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
You should take more than you think you&apos;ll need, maybe 50% to
100% more, because software takes longer to write and deals longer
to close than you expect.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Since people sometimes call us VCs, I should add that we&apos;re
not.  VCs invest large amounts of other people&apos;s money.  We invest
small amounts of our own, like angel investors.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Not linearly of course, or it would take forever to raise five
million dollars.  In practice it just feels like it takes forever.<br><br>Though if you include the cases where VCs don&apos;t invest, it would
literally take forever in the median case.  And maybe we should,
because the danger of chasing large investments is not just that
they take a long time.  That&apos;s the <i>best</i> case.  The real danger
is that you&apos;ll expend a lot of time and get nothing.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Some VCs will offer you an artificially low valuation to see
if you have the balls to ask for more.  It&apos;s lame that VCs play
such games, but some do.  If you&apos;re dealing with one of those you
should push back on the valuation a bit.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Suppose YouTube&apos;s founders had gone to Google in 2005 and told
them &quot;Google Video is badly designed.  Give us $10 million and we&apos;ll
tell you all the mistakes you made.&quot;  They would have gotten
the royal raspberry.  Eighteen months later Google paid $1.6 billion
for the same lesson, partly because they could then tell themselves
that they were buying a phenomenon, or a community, or some vague
thing like that.<br><br>I don&apos;t mean to be hard on Google.  They did better than their
competitors, who may have now missed the video boat entirely.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
Yes, actually: dealing with the government.  But phone companies
are up there.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
Many more than most people realize, because companies don&apos;t advertise
this.  Did you know Apple originally had three founders?<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
I&apos;m not dissing these people.  I don&apos;t have the determination
myself.  I&apos;ve twice come close to starting startups since Viaweb,
and both times I bailed because I realized that without the spur
of poverty I just wasn&apos;t willing to endure the stress of a startup.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
So how do you know whether you&apos;re in the category of people
who should quit their day job, or the presumably larger one who
shouldn&apos;t?  I got to the point of saying that this was hard to judge
for yourself and that you should seek outside advice, before realizing
that that&apos;s what we do.  We think of ourselves as investors, but
viewed from the other direction Y Combinator is a service for
advising people whether or not to quit their day job.  We could be
mistaken, and no doubt often are, but we do at least bet money on
our conclusions.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, Greg McAdoo, and Robert Morris

Each person has things they like, but no one&apos;s preferences are any
better than anyone else&apos;s.  There is no such thing as <i>good</i> taste.<br><br>Like a lot of things I grew up believing, this turns out to be
false, and I&apos;m going to try to explain why.<br><br>One problem with saying there&apos;s no such thing as good taste is that
it also means there&apos;s no such thing as good art.  If there were
good art, then people who liked it would have better taste than
people who didn&apos;t.  So if you discard taste, you also have to discard
the idea of art being good, and artists being good at making it.<br><br>It was pulling on that thread that unravelled my childhood faith
in relativism.  When you&apos;re trying to make things, taste becomes a
practical matter.  You have to decide what to do next.  Would it
make the painting better if I changed that part?  If there&apos;s no
such thing as better, it doesn&apos;t matter what you do.  In fact, it
doesn&apos;t matter if you paint at all.  You could just go out and buy
a ready-made blank canvas.  If there&apos;s no such thing as good, that
would be just as great an achievement as the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel.  Less laborious, certainly, but if you can achieve the same
level of performance with less effort, surely that&apos;s more impressive,
not less.<br><br>Yet that doesn&apos;t seem quite right, does it?<br><br><b>Audience</b><br><br>I think the key to this puzzle is to remember that art has an
audience.  Art has a purpose, which is to interest its audience.
Good art (like good anything) is art that achieves its purpose
particularly well.  The meaning of &quot;interest&quot; can vary.  Some works
of art are meant to shock, and others to please; some are meant to
jump out at you, and others to sit quietly in the background. But
all art has to work on an audience, and&#x2014;here&apos;s the critical 
point&#x2014;members of the audience share things in common.<br><br>For example, nearly all humans find human faces engaging.  It seems
to be wired into us.  Babies can recognize faces practically from
birth.  In fact, faces seem to have co-evolved with our interest
in them; the face is the body&apos;s billboard.  So all other things
being equal, a painting with faces in it will interest people more
than one without. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>One reason it&apos;s easy to believe that taste is merely personal
preference is that, if it isn&apos;t, how do you pick out the people
with better taste?  There are billions of people, each with their
own opinion; on what grounds can you prefer one to another?
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>But if audiences have a lot in common, you&apos;re not in a position of
having to choose one out of a random set of individual biases,
because the set isn&apos;t random.  All humans find faces 
engaging&#x2014;practically by definition: face recognition is 
in our DNA.  And so
having a notion of good art, in the sense of art that does its job
well, doesn&apos;t require you to pick out a few individuals and label
their opinions as correct.  No matter who you pick, they&apos;ll find
faces engaging.<br><br>Of course, space aliens probably wouldn&apos;t find human faces engaging.
But there might be other things they shared in common with us.  The
most likely source of examples is math.  I expect space aliens would
agree with us most of the time about which of two proofs was better.
Erdos thought so.  He called a maximally elegant proof one out of
God&apos;s book, and presumably God&apos;s book is universal.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Once you start talking about audiences, you don&apos;t have to argue
simply that there are or aren&apos;t standards of taste.  Instead tastes
are a series of concentric rings, like ripples in a pond.  There
are some things that will appeal to you and your friends, others
that will appeal to most people your age, others that will appeal
to most humans, and perhaps others that would appeal to most sentient
beings (whatever that means).<br><br>The picture is slightly more complicated than that, because in the
middle of the pond there are overlapping sets of ripples.  For
example, there might be things that appealed particularly to men,
or to people from a certain culture.<br><br>If good art is art that interests its audience, then when you talk
about art being good, you also have to say for what audience.  So
is it meaningless to talk about art simply being good or bad?  No,
because one audience is the set of all possible humans.  I think
that&apos;s the audience people are implicitly talking about when they
say a work of art is good: they mean it would engage any human.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>And that is a meaningful test, because although, like any everyday
concept, &quot;human&quot; is fuzzy around the edges, there are a lot of
things practically all humans have in common.  In addition to our
interest in faces, there&apos;s something special about primary colors
for nearly all of us, because it&apos;s an artifact of the way our eyes
work.  Most humans will also find images of 3D objects engaging,
because that also seems to be built into our visual perception.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font>
And beneath that there&apos;s edge-finding, which makes images
with definite shapes more engaging than mere blur.<br><br>Humans have a lot more in common than this, of course.  My goal is
not to compile a complete list, just to show that there&apos;s some solid
ground here.  People&apos;s preferences aren&apos;t random.  So an artist
working on a painting and trying to decide whether to change some
part of it doesn&apos;t have to think &quot;Why bother?  I might as well flip
a coin.&quot; Instead he can ask &quot;What would make the painting more
interesting to people?&quot;  And the reason you can&apos;t equal Michelangelo
by going out and buying a blank canvas is that the ceiling of the
Sistine Chapel is more interesting to people.<br><br>A lot of philosophers have had a hard time believing it was possible
for there to be objective standards for art. It seemed obvious that
beauty, for example, was something that happened in the head of the observer,
not something that was a property of objects.  It was thus 
&quot;subjective&quot; rather than &quot;objective.&quot;  But in fact if you narrow the
definition of beauty to something that works a certain way on
humans, and you observe how much humans have in common, it turns out
to be a property of objects after all.   You don&apos;t
have to choose between something being a property of the   
subject or the object if subjects all react similarly.
Being good art is thus a property of objects as much as, say, being
toxic to humans is: it&apos;s good art if it consistently affects humans 
in a certain way.<br><br>
<b>Error</b><br><br>So could we figure out what the best art is by taking a vote?  After
all, if appealing to humans is the test, we should be able to just
ask them, right?<br><br>Well, not quite.  For products of nature that might work.  I&apos;d be
willing to eat the apple the world&apos;s population had voted most
delicious, and I&apos;d probably be willing to visit the beach they voted
most beautiful, but having to look at the painting they voted the
best would be a crapshoot.<br><br>Man-made stuff is different.  For one thing, artists, unlike apple
trees, often deliberately try to trick us.  Some tricks are quite
subtle.  For example, any work of art sets expectations by its level
of finish.  You don&apos;t expect photographic accuracy in something
that looks like a quick sketch.  So one widely used trick, especially
among illustrators, is to intentionally make a painting or drawing
look like it was done faster than it was.  The average person looks
at it and thinks: how amazingly skillful.  It&apos;s like saying something
clever in a conversation as if you&apos;d thought of it on the spur of
the moment, when in fact you&apos;d worked it out the day before.<br><br>Another much less subtle influence is brand.  If you go to see the
Mona Lisa, you&apos;ll probably be disappointed, because it&apos;s hidden
behind a thick glass wall and surrounded by a frenzied crowd taking
pictures of themselves in front of it.  At best you can see it the
way you see a friend across the room at a crowded party.  The Louvre
might as well replace it with copy; no one would be able to tell.
And yet the Mona Lisa is a small, dark painting.  If you found
people who&apos;d never seen an image of it and sent them to a museum
in which it was hanging among other paintings with a tag labelling
it as a portrait by an unknown fifteenth century artist, most would
walk by without giving it a second look.<br><br>For the average person, brand dominates all other factors in the
judgement of art.  Seeing a painting they recognize from reproductions
is so overwhelming that their response to it as a painting is drowned
out.<br><br>And then of course there are the tricks people play on themselves.
Most adults looking at art worry that if they don&apos;t like what they&apos;re
supposed to, they&apos;ll be thought uncultured.  This doesn&apos;t just
affect what they claim to like; they actually make themselves like
things they&apos;re supposed to.<br><br>That&apos;s why you can&apos;t just take a vote.  Though appeal to people is
a meaningful test, in practice you can&apos;t measure it, just as you
can&apos;t find north using a compass with a magnet sitting next to it.
There are sources of error so powerful that if you take a vote, all
you&apos;re measuring is the error.<br><br>We can, however, approach our goal from another direction, by using
ourselves as guinea pigs.  You&apos;re human.  If you want to know what
the basic human reaction to a piece of art would be, you can at
least approach that by getting rid of the sources of error in your
own judgements.<br><br>For example, while anyone&apos;s reaction to a famous painting will be
warped at first by its fame, there are ways to decrease its effects.
One is to come back to the painting over and over.  After a few
days the fame wears off, and you can start to see it as a painting.
Another is to stand close.  A painting familiar from reproductions
looks more familiar from ten feet away; close in you see details
that get lost in reproductions, and which you&apos;re therefore seeing
for the first time.<br><br>There are two main kinds of error that get in the way of seeing a
work of art: biases you bring from your own circumstances, and
tricks played by the artist.  Tricks are straightforward to correct
for. Merely being aware of them usually prevents them from working.
For example, when I was ten I used to be very impressed by airbrushed
lettering that looked like shiny metal.  But once you study how
it&apos;s done, you see that it&apos;s a pretty cheesy trick&#x2014;one of the
sort that relies on pushing a few visual buttons really hard to
temporarily overwhelm the viewer.  It&apos;s like trying to convince
someone by shouting at them.<br><br>The way not to be vulnerable to tricks is to explicitly seek out
and catalog them.  When you notice a whiff of dishonesty coming
from some kind of art, stop and figure out what&apos;s going on.  When
someone is obviously pandering to an audience that&apos;s easily fooled,
whether it&apos;s someone making shiny stuff to impress ten year olds,
or someone making conspicuously avant-garde stuff to impress would-be
intellectuals, learn how they do it.  Once you&apos;ve seen enough
examples of specific types of tricks, you start to become a connoisseur
of trickery in general, just as professional magicians are.<br><br>What counts as a trick?  Roughly, it&apos;s something done with contempt
for the audience.  For example, the guys designing Ferraris in the
1950s were probably designing cars that they themselves admired.
Whereas I suspect over at General Motors the marketing people are
telling the designers, &quot;Most people who buy SUVs do it to seem
manly, not to drive off-road. So don&apos;t worry about the suspension;
just make that sucker as big and tough-looking as you can.&quot; 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>I think with some effort you can make yourself nearly immune to
tricks.  It&apos;s harder to escape the influence of your own circumstances,
but you can at least move in that direction.  The way to do it is
to travel widely, in both time and space.  If you go and see all
the different kinds of things people like in other cultures, and
learn about all the different things people have liked in the past,
you&apos;ll probably find it changes what you like.  I doubt you could
ever make yourself into a completely universal person, if only
because you can only travel in one direction in time.  But if you
find a work of art that would appeal equally to your friends, to
people in Nepal, and to the ancient Greeks, you&apos;re probably onto
something.<br><br>My main point here is not how to have good taste, but that there
can even be such a thing.  And I think I&apos;ve shown that.  There is
such a thing as good art. It&apos;s art that interests its human audience,
and since humans have a lot in common, what interests them is not
random.  Since there&apos;s such a thing as good art, there&apos;s
also such a thing as good taste, which is the ability to recognize
it.<br><br>If we were talking about the taste of apples, I&apos;d agree that taste
is just personal preference.  Some people like certain kinds of
apples and others like other kinds, but how can you say that one
is right and the other wrong? 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>The thing is, art isn&apos;t apples.  Art is man-made. It comes with a
lot of cultural baggage, and in addition the people who make it
often try to trick us.  Most people&apos;s judgement of art is dominated
by these extraneous factors; they&apos;re like someone trying to judge
the taste of apples in a dish made of equal parts apples and jalapeno
peppers.  All they&apos;re tasting is the peppers.  So it turns out you
can pick out some people and say that they have better taste than
others: they&apos;re the ones who actually taste art like apples.<br><br>Or to put it more prosaically, they&apos;re the people who (a) are hard
to trick, and (b) don&apos;t just like whatever they grew up with.  If
you could find people who&apos;d eliminated all such influences on their
judgement, you&apos;d probably still see variation in what they liked.
But because humans have so much in common, you&apos;d also find they
agreed on a lot.  They&apos;d nearly all prefer the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel to a blank canvas.<br><br><b>Making It</b><br><br>I wrote this essay because I was tired of hearing &quot;taste is subjective&quot;
and wanted to kill it once and for all. Anyone who makes things
knows intuitively that&apos;s not true.  When you&apos;re trying to make art,
the temptation to be lazy is as great as in any other kind of work.
Of course it matters to do a good job.  And yet you can see how
great a hold &quot;taste is subjective&quot; has even in the art world by how
nervous it makes people to talk about art being good or bad.  Those
whose jobs require them to judge art, like curators, mostly resort
to euphemisms like &quot;significant&quot; or &quot;important&quot; or (getting dangerously
close) &quot;realized.&quot; 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>I don&apos;t have any illusions that being able to talk about art being
good or bad will cause the people who talk about it to have anything
more useful to say.  Indeed, one of the reasons &quot;taste is subjective&quot;
found such a receptive audience is that, historically, the things
people have said about good taste have generally been such nonsense.<br><br>It&apos;s not for the people who talk about art that I want to free the
idea of good art, but for those who 
<a href="taste.html">make</a> it.  Right now, ambitious
kids going to art school run smack into a brick wall.  They arrive
hoping one day to be as good as the famous artists they&apos;ve seen in
books, and the first thing they learn is that the concept of good
has been retired.  Instead everyone is just supposed to explore
their own personal vision. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>When I was in art school, we were looking one day at a slide of
some great fifteenth century painting, and one of the students asked
&quot;Why don&apos;t artists paint like that now?&quot; The room suddenly got
quiet.  Though rarely asked out loud, this question lurks uncomfortably
in the back of every art student&apos;s mind.  It was as if someone had
brought up the topic of lung cancer in a meeting within Philip
Morris.<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; the professor replied, &quot;we&apos;re interested in different
questions now.&quot;  He was a pretty nice guy, but at the time I couldn&apos;t
help wishing I could send him back to fifteenth century Florence
to explain in person to Leonardo &amp; Co. how we had moved beyond their
early, limited concept of art.  Just imagine that conversation.<br><br>In fact, one of the reasons artists in fifteenth century Florence made
such great things was that they believed you could make great things.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#777777">10</font></a>]</font>
They were intensely competitive and were always trying to outdo
one another, like mathematicians or physicists today&#x2014;maybe like
anyone who has ever done anything really well.<br><br>The idea that you could make great things was not just a useful
illusion.  They were actually right.  So the most important consequence
of realizing there can be good art is that it frees artists to try
to make it.  To the ambitious kids arriving at art school this year
hoping one day to make great things, I say: don&apos;t believe it when
they tell you this is a naive and outdated ambition.  There is such
a thing as good art, and if you try to make it, there are people
who will notice.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This is not to say, of course, that good paintings must
have faces in them, just that everyone&apos;s visual piano has that key
on it.  There are situations in which you want to avoid faces,
precisely because they attract so much attention.  But you can see
how universally faces work by their prevalence in
advertising.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
The other reason it&apos;s easy to believe is that it makes people
feel good.  To a kid, this idea is crack.  In every other respect
they&apos;re constantly being told that they have a lot to learn.  But
in this they&apos;re perfect.  Their opinion carries the same weight as
any adult&apos;s.  You should probably question anything you believed
as a kid that you&apos;d want to believe this much.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
It&apos;s conceivable that the elegance of proofs is quantifiable,
in the sense that there may be some formal measure that turns out
to coincide with mathematicians&apos; judgements.  Perhaps it would be
worth trying to make a formal language for proofs in which those
considered more elegant consistently came out shorter (perhaps after
being macroexpanded or compiled).<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Maybe it would be possible to make art that would appeal to
space aliens, but I&apos;m not going to get into that because (a) it&apos;s
too hard to answer, and (b) I&apos;m satisfied if I can establish that
good art is a meaningful idea for human audiences.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
If early abstract paintings seem more interesting than later
ones, it may be because the first abstract painters were trained
to paint from life, and their hands thus tended to make the kind
of gestures you use in representing physical things.  In effect
they were saying &quot;scaramara&quot; instead of &quot;uebfgbsb.&quot;<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
It&apos;s a bit more complicated, because sometimes artists
unconsciously use tricks by imitating art that does.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
I phrased this in terms of the taste of apples because if
people can see the apples, they can be fooled.  When I was a kid
most apples were a variety called Red Delicious that had been bred
to look appealing in stores, but which didn&apos;t taste very good.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
To be fair, curators are in a difficult position.  If they&apos;re
dealing with recent art, they have to include things in shows that
they think are bad.  That&apos;s because the test for what gets included
in shows is basically the market price, and for recent art that is
largely determined by successful businessmen and their wives.  So
it&apos;s not always intellectual dishonesty that makes curators and
dealers use neutral-sounding language.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
What happens in practice is that everyone gets really good at
<i>talking</i> about art.  As the art itself gets more random, the effort
that would have gone into the work goes instead into the intellectual
sounding theory behind it.  &quot;My work represents an exploration of
gender and sexuality in an urban context,&quot; etc.  Different people
win at that game.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
There were several other reasons, including that Florence was
then the richest and most sophisticated city in the world, and that
they lived in a time before photography had (a) killed portraiture
as a source of income and (b) made brand the dominant factor in the
sale of art.<br><br>Incidentally, I&apos;m not saying that good art = fifteenth century
European art.  I&apos;m not saying we should make what they made, but
that we should work like they worked.  There are fields now in which
many people work with the same energy and honesty that fifteenth
century artists did, but art is not one of them.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597141">Founders at Work</a>.)</i><br><br>Apparently sprinters reach their highest speed right out of the
blocks, and spend the rest of the race slowing down.  The winners
slow down the least.  It&apos;s that way with most startups too.  The
earliest phase is usually the most productive.  That&apos;s when they
have the really big ideas.  Imagine what Apple was like when 100%
of its employees were either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak.<br><br>The striking thing about this phase is that it&apos;s completely different
from most people&apos;s idea of what business is like.  If you looked
in people&apos;s heads (or stock photo collections) for images representing
&quot;business,&quot; you&apos;d get images of people dressed up in suits, groups
sitting around conference tables looking serious, Powerpoint
presentations, people producing thick reports for one another to
read.   Early stage startups are the exact opposite of this.  And
yet they&apos;re probably the most productive part of the whole economy.<br><br>Why the disconnect?  I think there&apos;s a general principle at work
here: the less energy people expend on performance, the more they
expend on appearances to compensate.  More often than not the energy
they expend on seeming impressive makes their actual performance
worse.  A few years ago I read an article in which a car magazine
modified the &quot;sports&quot; model of some production car to get the fastest
possible standing quarter mile.  You know how they did it?  They
cut off all the crap the manufacturer had bolted onto the car to
make it <i>look</i> fast.<br><br>Business is broken the same way that car was.  The effort that goes
into looking productive is not merely wasted, but actually makes
organizations less productive.  Suits, for example.  Suits do not
help people to think better.  I bet most executives at big companies
do their best thinking when they wake up on Sunday morning and go
downstairs in their bathrobe to make a cup of coffee.  That&apos;s when
you have ideas.  Just imagine what a company would be like if people
could think that well at work.  People do in startups, at least
some of the time.  (Half the time you&apos;re in a panic because your
servers are on fire, but the other half you&apos;re thinking as deeply
as most people only get to sitting alone on a Sunday morning.)<br><br>Ditto for most of the other differences between startups and what
passes for productivity in big companies.  And yet conventional
ideas of professionalism have such an iron grip on our minds that
even startup founders are affected by them.  In our startup, when
outsiders came to visit we tried hard to seem &quot;professional.&quot; We&apos;d
clean up our offices, wear better clothes, try to arrange that a
lot of people were there during conventional office hours.  In fact,
programming didn&apos;t get done by well-dressed people at clean desks
during office hours.  It got done by badly dressed people (I was
notorious for programmming wearing just a towel) in offices strewn
with junk at 2 in the morning.  But no visitor would understand
that.  Not even investors, who are supposed to be able to recognize
real productivity when they see it.  Even we were affected by the
conventional wisdom.  We thought of ourselves as impostors, succeeding
despite being totally unprofessional.  It was as if we&apos;d created a
Formula 1 car but felt sheepish because it didn&apos;t look like a car
was supposed to look.<br><br>In the car world, there are at least some people who know that a
high performance car looks like a Formula 1 racecar, not a sedan
with giant rims and a fake spoiler bolted to the trunk.  Why not
in business?  Probably because startups are so small.  The really
dramatic growth happens when a startup only has three or four people,
so only three or four people see that, whereas tens of thousands
see business as it&apos;s practiced by Boeing or Philip Morris.<br><br>This book can help fix that problem, by showing everyone what, till
now, only a handful people got to see: what happens in the first
year of a startup.  This is what real productivity looks like. This
is the Formula 1 racecar.  It looks weird, but it goes fast.<br><br>Of course, big companies won&apos;t be able to do everything these
startups do.  In big companies there&apos;s always going to be more
politics, and less scope for individual decisions.  But seeing what
startups are really like will at least show other organizations
what to aim for.  The time may soon be coming when instead of
startups trying to seem more corporate, corporations will try to
seem more like startups.  That would be a good thing.<br><br><br><br>

for 25 years: the relationship between wisdom and intelligence.
Anyone can see they&apos;re not the same by the number of people who are
smart, but not very wise.  And yet intelligence and wisdom do seem
related.  How?<br><br>What is wisdom?  I&apos;d say it&apos;s knowing what to do in a lot of
situations.  I&apos;m not trying to make a deep point here about the
true nature of wisdom, just to figure out how we use the word.  A
wise person is someone who usually knows the right thing to do.<br><br>And yet isn&apos;t being smart also knowing what to do in certain
situations?  For example, knowing what to do when the teacher tells
your elementary school class to add all the numbers from 1 to 100?
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Some say wisdom and intelligence apply to different types of
problems&#x2014;wisdom to human problems and intelligence to abstract
ones.  But that isn&apos;t true.  Some wisdom has nothing to do with
people: for example, the wisdom of the engineer who knows certain
structures are less prone to failure than others.  And certainly
smart people can find clever solutions to human problems as well
as abstract ones. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another popular explanation is that wisdom comes from experience
while intelligence is innate.  But people are not simply wise in
proportion to how much experience they have.  Other things must
contribute to wisdom besides experience, and some may be innate: a
reflective disposition, for example.<br><br>Neither of the conventional explanations of the difference between
wisdom and intelligence stands up to scrutiny.  So what is the
difference?  If we look at how people use the words &quot;wise&quot; and
&quot;smart,&quot; what they seem to mean is different shapes of performance.<br><br><b>Curve</b><br><br>&quot;Wise&quot; and &quot;smart&quot; are both ways of saying someone knows what to
do.  The difference is that &quot;wise&quot; means one has a high average
outcome across all situations, and &quot;smart&quot; means one does spectacularly
well in a few.  That is, if you had a graph in which the x axis
represented situations and the y axis the outcome, the graph of the
wise person would be high overall, and the graph of the smart person
would have high peaks.<br><br>The distinction is similar to the rule that one should judge talent
at its best and character at its worst.  Except you judge intelligence
at its best, and wisdom by its average.  That&apos;s how the two are
related: they&apos;re the two different senses in which the same curve
can be high.<br><br>So a wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart
person knows what to do in situations where few others could.  We
need to add one more qualification: we should ignore cases where
someone knows what to do because they have inside information. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
But aside from that, I don&apos;t think we can get much more specific
without starting to be mistaken.<br><br>Nor do we need to.  Simple as it is, this explanation predicts, or
at least accords with, both of the conventional stories about the
distinction between wisdom and intelligence.  Human problems are
the most common type, so being good at solving those is key in
achieving a high average outcome.   And it seems natural that a
high average outcome depends mostly on experience, but that dramatic
peaks can only be achieved by people with certain rare, innate
qualities; nearly anyone can learn to be a good swimmer, but to be
an Olympic swimmer you need a certain body type.<br><br>This explanation also suggests why wisdom is such an elusive concept:
there&apos;s no such thing.  &quot;Wise&quot; means something&#x2014;that one is
on average good at making the right choice.  But giving the name
&quot;wisdom&quot; to the supposed quality that enables one to do that doesn&apos;t
mean such a thing exists.  To the extent &quot;wisdom&quot; means anything,
it refers to a grab-bag of qualities as various as self-discipline,
experience, and empathy.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Likewise, though &quot;intelligent&quot; means something, we&apos;re asking for
trouble if we insist on looking for a single thing called &quot;intelligence.&quot;
And whatever its components, they&apos;re not all innate.  We use the
word &quot;intelligent&quot; as an indication of ability: a smart person can
grasp things few others could.  It does seem likely there&apos;s some
inborn predisposition to intelligence (and wisdom too), but this
predisposition is not itself intelligence.<br><br>One reason we tend to think of intelligence as inborn is that people
trying to measure it have concentrated on the aspects of it that
are most measurable.  A quality that&apos;s inborn will obviously be
more convenient to work with than one that&apos;s influenced by experience,
and thus might vary in the course of a study.  The problem comes
when we drag the word &quot;intelligence&quot; over onto what they&apos;re measuring.
If they&apos;re measuring something inborn, they can&apos;t be measuring
intelligence.  Three year olds aren&apos;t smart.   When we describe one
as smart, it&apos;s shorthand for &quot;smarter than other three year olds.&quot;<br><br><b>Split</b><br><br>Perhaps it&apos;s a technicality to point out that a predisposition to
intelligence is not the same as intelligence.  But it&apos;s an important
technicality, because it reminds us that we can become smarter,
just as we can become wiser.<br><br>The alarming thing is that we may have to choose between the two.<br><br>If wisdom and intelligence are the average and peaks of the same
curve, then they converge as the number of points on the curve
decreases.  If there&apos;s just one point, they&apos;re identical: the average
and maximum are the same.  But as the number of points increases,
wisdom and intelligence diverge.  And historically the number of
points on the curve seems to have been increasing: our ability is
tested in an ever wider range of situations.<br><br>In the time of Confucius and Socrates, people seem to have regarded
wisdom, learning, and intelligence as more closely related than we
do.  Distinguishing between &quot;wise&quot; and &quot;smart&quot; is a modern habit.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font>
And the reason we do is that they&apos;ve been diverging.  As knowledge
gets more specialized, there are more points on the curve, and the
distinction between the spikes and the average becomes sharper,
like a digital image rendered with more pixels.<br><br>One consequence is that some old recipes may have become obsolete.
At the very least we have to go back and figure out if they were
really recipes for wisdom or intelligence.  But the really striking
change, as intelligence and wisdom drift apart, is that we may have
to decide which we prefer.  We may not be able to optimize for both
simultaneously.<br><br>Society seems to have voted for intelligence.  We no longer admire
the sage&#x2014;not the way people did two thousand years ago.  Now
we admire the genius.  Because in fact the distinction we began
with has a rather brutal converse: just as you can be smart without
being very wise, you can be wise without being very smart.  That
doesn&apos;t sound especially admirable.  That gets you James Bond, who
knows what to do in a lot of situations, but has to rely on Q for
the ones involving math.<br><br>Intelligence and wisdom are obviously not mutually exclusive.  In
fact, a high average may help support high peaks.  But there are
reasons to believe that at some point you have to choose between
them.  One is the example of very smart people, who are so often
unwise that in popular culture this now seems to be regarded as the
rule rather than the exception.  Perhaps the absent-minded professor
is wise in his way, or wiser than he seems, but he&apos;s not wise in
the way Confucius or Socrates wanted people to be. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>New</b><br><br>For both Confucius and Socrates, wisdom, virtue, and happiness were
necessarily related.  The wise man was someone who knew what the
right choice was and always made it; to be the right choice, it had
to be morally right; he was therefore always happy, knowing he&apos;d
done the best he could.  I can&apos;t think of many ancient philosophers
who would have disagreed with that, so far as it goes.<br><br>&quot;The superior man is always happy; the small man sad,&quot; said Confucius.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Whereas a few years ago I read an interview with a mathematician
who said that most nights he went to bed discontented, feeling he
hadn&apos;t made enough progress.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font>
The Chinese and Greek words we
translate as &quot;happy&quot; didn&apos;t mean exactly what we do by it, but
there&apos;s enough overlap that this remark contradicts them.<br><br>Is the mathematician a small man because he&apos;s discontented?  No;
he&apos;s just doing a kind of work that wasn&apos;t very common in Confucius&apos;s
day.<br><br>Human knowledge seems to grow fractally.  Time after time, something
that seemed a small and uninteresting area&#x2014;experimental error,
even&#x2014;turns out, when examined up close, to have as much in
it as all knowledge up to that point.  Several of the fractal buds
that have exploded since ancient times involve inventing and
discovering new things.  Math, for example, used to be something a
handful of people did part-time.  Now it&apos;s the career of thousands.
And in work that involves making new things, some old rules don&apos;t
apply.<br><br>Recently I&apos;ve spent some time advising people, and there I find the
ancient rule still works: try to understand the situation as well
as you can, give the best advice you can based on your experience,
and then don&apos;t worry about it, knowing you did all you could.  But
I don&apos;t have anything like this serenity when I&apos;m writing an essay.
Then I&apos;m worried.  What if I run out of ideas?  And when I&apos;m writing,
four nights out of five I go to bed discontented, feeling I didn&apos;t
get enough done.<br><br>Advising people and writing are fundamentally different types of
work.  When people come to you with a problem and you have to figure
out the right thing to do, you don&apos;t (usually) have to invent
anything.  You just weigh the alternatives and try to judge which
is the prudent choice.  But <i>prudence</i> can&apos;t tell me what sentence
to write next.  The search space is too big.<br><br>Someone like a judge or a military officer can in much of his work
be guided by duty, but duty is no guide in making things.  Makers
depend on something more precarious: inspiration.  And like most
people who lead a precarious existence, they tend to be worried,
not contented.  In that respect they&apos;re more like the small man of
Confucius&apos;s day, always one bad harvest (or ruler) away from
starvation. Except instead of being at the mercy of weather and
officials, they&apos;re at the mercy of their own imagination.<br><br><b>Limits</b><br><br>To me it was a relief just to realize it might be ok to be discontented.
The idea that a successful person should be happy has thousands of
years of momentum behind it.  If I was any good, why didn&apos;t I have
the easy confidence winners are supposed to have?  But that, I now
believe, is like a runner asking &quot;If I&apos;m such a good athlete, why
do I feel so tired?&quot; Good runners still get tired; they just get
tired at higher speeds.<br><br>People whose work is to invent or discover things are in the same
position as the runner.  There&apos;s no way for them to do the best
they can, because there&apos;s no limit to what they could do.  The
closest you can come is to compare yourself to other people.  But
the better you do, the less this matters.  An undergrad who gets
something published feels like a star.  But for someone at the top
of the field, what&apos;s the test of doing well?  Runners can at least
compare themselves to others doing exactly the same thing; if you
win an Olympic gold medal, you can be fairly content, even if you
think you could have run a bit faster.  But what is a novelist to
do?<br><br>Whereas if you&apos;re doing the kind of work in which problems are
presented to you and you have to choose between several alternatives,
there&apos;s an upper bound on your performance: choosing the best every
time.  In ancient societies, nearly all work seems to have been of
this type.  The peasant had to decide whether a garment was worth
mending, and the king whether or not to invade his neighbor, but
neither was expected to invent anything.  In principle they could
have; the king could have invented firearms, then invaded his
neighbor.  But in practice innovations were so rare that they weren&apos;t
expected of you, any more than goalkeepers are expected to score
goals. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font>
In practice, it seemed as if there was a correct decision
in every situation, and if you made it you&apos;d done your job perfectly,
just as a goalkeeper who prevents the other team from scoring is
considered to have played a perfect game.<br><br>In this world, wisdom seemed paramount.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#777777">10</font></a>]</font>
Even now, most people
do work in which problems are put before them and they have to
choose the best alternative.  But as knowledge has grown more
specialized, there are more and more types of work in which people
have to make up new things, and in which performance is therefore
unbounded.  Intelligence has become increasingly important relative
to wisdom because there is more room for spikes.<br><br><b>Recipes</b><br><br>Another sign we may have to choose between intelligence and wisdom
is how different their recipes are.  Wisdom seems to come largely
from curing childish qualities, and intelligence largely from
cultivating them.<br><br>Recipes for wisdom, particularly ancient ones, tend to have a
remedial character.  To achieve wisdom one must cut away all the
debris that fills one&apos;s head on emergence from childhood, leaving
only the important stuff.  Both self-control and experience have
this effect: to eliminate the random biases that come from your own
nature and from the circumstances of your upbringing respectively.
That&apos;s not all wisdom is, but it&apos;s a large part of it.  Much of
what&apos;s in the sage&apos;s head is also in the head of every twelve year
old.  The difference is that in the head of the twelve year old
it&apos;s mixed together with a lot of random junk.<br><br>The path to intelligence seems to be through working on hard problems.
You develop intelligence as you might develop muscles, through
exercise.  But there can&apos;t be too much compulsion here.  No amount
of discipline can replace genuine curiosity.  So cultivating
intelligence seems to be a matter of identifying some bias in one&apos;s
character&#x2014;some tendency to be interested in certain types of
things&#x2014;and nurturing it.  Instead of obliterating your
idiosyncrasies in an effort to make yourself a neutral vessel for
the truth, you select one and try to grow it from a seedling into
a tree.<br><br>The wise are all much alike in their wisdom, but very smart people
tend to be smart in distinctive ways.<br><br>Most of our educational traditions aim at wisdom. So perhaps one
reason schools work badly is that they&apos;re trying to make intelligence
using recipes for wisdom.  Most recipes for wisdom have an element
of subjection.  At the very least, you&apos;re supposed to do what the
teacher says.  The more extreme recipes aim to break down your
individuality the way basic training does.  But that&apos;s not the route
to intelligence.  Whereas wisdom comes through humility, it may
actually help, in cultivating intelligence, to have a mistakenly
high opinion of your abilities, because that encourages you to keep
working.  Ideally till you realize how mistaken you were.<br><br>(The reason it&apos;s hard to learn new skills late in life is not just
that one&apos;s brain is less malleable.  Another probably even worse
obstacle is that one has higher standards.)<br><br>I realize we&apos;re on dangerous ground here.  I&apos;m not proposing the
primary goal of education should be to increase students&apos; &quot;self-esteem.&quot;
That just breeds laziness.  And in any case, it doesn&apos;t really fool
the kids, not the smart ones.  They can tell at a young age that a
contest where everyone wins is a fraud.<br><br>A teacher has to walk a narrow path: you want to encourage kids to
come up with things on their own, but you can&apos;t simply applaud
everything they produce.  You have to be a good audience: appreciative,
but not too easily impressed.  And that&apos;s a lot of work.  You have
to have a good enough grasp of kids&apos; capacities at different ages
to know when to be surprised.<br><br>That&apos;s the opposite of traditional recipes for education.  Traditionally
the student is the audience, not the teacher; the student&apos;s job is
not to invent, but to absorb some prescribed body of material.  (The
use of the term &quot;recitation&quot; for sections in some colleges is a
fossil of this.) The problem with these old traditions is that
they&apos;re too much influenced by recipes for wisdom.<br><br><b>Different</b><br><br>I deliberately gave this essay a provocative title; of course it&apos;s
worth being wise.  But I think it&apos;s important to understand the
relationship between intelligence and wisdom, and particularly what
seems to be the growing gap between them.  That way we can avoid
applying rules and standards to intelligence that are really meant
for wisdom.  These two senses of &quot;knowing what to do&quot; are more
different than most people realize.  The path to wisdom is through
discipline, and the path to intelligence through carefully selected
self-indulgence.  Wisdom is universal, and intelligence idiosyncratic.
And while wisdom yields calmness, intelligence much of the time
leads to discontentment.<br><br>That&apos;s particularly worth remembering.  A physicist friend recently
told me half his department was on Prozac.  Perhaps if we acknowledge
that some amount of frustration is inevitable in certain kinds
of work, we can mitigate its effects.  Perhaps we can box it up and
put it away some of the time, instead of letting it flow together
with everyday sadness to produce what seems an alarmingly large
pool.  At the very least, we can avoid being discontented about
being discontented.<br><br>If you feel exhausted, it&apos;s not necessarily because there&apos;s something
wrong with you.  Maybe you&apos;re just running fast.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Gauss was supposedly asked this when he was 10.  Instead of
laboriously adding together the numbers like the other students,
he saw that they consisted of 50 pairs that each summed to 101 (100
+ 1, 99 + 2, etc), and that he could just multiply 101 by 50 to get
the answer, 5050.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
A variant is that intelligence is the ability to solve problems,
and wisdom the judgement to know how to use those solutions.   But
while this is certainly an important relationship between wisdom
and intelligence, it&apos;s not the <i>distinction between</i> them.  Wisdom
is useful in solving problems too, and intelligence can help in
deciding what to do with the solutions.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
In judging both intelligence and wisdom we have to factor out
some knowledge. People who know the combination of a safe will be
better at opening it than people who don&apos;t, but no one would say
that was a test of intelligence or wisdom.<br><br>But knowledge overlaps with wisdom and probably also intelligence.
A knowledge of human nature is certainly part of wisdom.  So where
do we draw the line?<br><br>Perhaps the solution is to discount knowledge that at some point
has a sharp drop in utility.  For example, understanding French
will help you in a large number of situations, but its value drops
sharply as soon as no one else involved knows French.  Whereas the
value of understanding vanity would decline more gradually.<br><br>The knowledge whose utility drops sharply is the kind that has
little relation to other knowledge.  This includes mere conventions,
like languages and safe combinations, and also what we&apos;d call
&quot;random&quot; facts, like movie stars&apos; birthdays, or how to distinguish
1956 from 1957 Studebakers.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
People seeking some single thing called &quot;wisdom&quot; have been
fooled by grammar.  Wisdom is just knowing the right thing to do,
and there are a hundred and one different qualities that help in
that.  Some, like selflessness, might come from meditating in an
empty room, and others, like a knowledge of human nature, might
come from going to drunken parties.<br><br>Perhaps realizing this will help dispel the cloud of semi-sacred
mystery that surrounds wisdom in so many people&apos;s eyes.  The mystery
comes mostly from looking for something that doesn&apos;t exist.  And
the reason there have historically been so many different schools
of thought about how to achieve wisdom is that they&apos;ve focused on
different components of it.<br><br>When I use the word &quot;wisdom&quot; in this essay, I mean no more than
whatever collection of qualities helps people make the right choice
in a wide variety of situations.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Even in English, our sense of the word &quot;intelligence&quot; is
surprisingly recent.  Predecessors like &quot;understanding&quot; seem to
have had a broader meaning.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
There is of course some uncertainty about how closely the remarks
attributed to Confucius and Socrates resemble their actual opinions.
I&apos;m using these names as we use the name &quot;Homer,&quot; to mean the
hypothetical people who said the things attributed to them.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
<i>Analects</i> VII:36, Fung trans.<br><br>Some translators use &quot;calm&quot; instead of &quot;happy.&quot;  One source of
difficulty here is that present-day English speakers have a different
idea of happiness from many older societies.  Every language probably
has a word meaning &quot;how one feels when things are going well,&quot; but
different cultures react differently when things go well.  We react
like children, with smiles and laughter.  But in a more reserved
society, or in one where life was tougher, the reaction might be a
quiet contentment.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
It may have been Andrew Wiles, but I&apos;m not sure.  If anyone
remembers such an interview, I&apos;d appreciate hearing from you.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Confucius claimed proudly that he had never invented
anything&#x2014;that he had simply passed on an accurate account of
ancient traditions.  [<i>Analects</i> VII:1] It&apos;s hard for us now to
appreciate how important a duty it must have been in preliterate
societies to remember and pass on the group&apos;s accumulated knowledge.
Even in Confucius&apos;s time it still seems to have been the first duty
of the scholar.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
The bias toward wisdom in ancient philosophy may be exaggerated
by the fact that, in both Greece and China, many of the first
philosophers (including Confucius and Plato) saw themselves as
teachers of administrators, and so thought disproportionately about
such matters.  The few people who did invent things, like storytellers,
must have seemed an outlying data point that could be ignored.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston,

<p>
March 2007<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from talks at the 2007 
Startup School and the Berkeley CSUA.)</i><br><br>We&apos;ve now been doing Y Combinator long enough to have some data
about success rates.  Our first batch, in the summer of 2005, had
eight startups in it.  Of those eight, it now looks as if at least
four succeeded.  Three have been acquired: 
<a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> was a merger of
two, Reddit and Infogami, and a third was acquired that we can&apos;t
talk about yet.  Another from that batch was 
<a href="http://loopt.com">Loopt</a>, which is doing
so well they could probably be acquired in about ten minutes if
they wanted to.<br><br>So about half the founders from that first summer, less than two
years ago, are now rich, at least by their standards.  (One thing
you learn when you get rich is that there are many degrees of it.)<br><br>I&apos;m not ready to predict our success rate will stay as high as 50%.
That first batch could have been an anomaly.  But we should be able
to do better than the oft-quoted (and probably made
up) standard figure of 10%.  I&apos;d feel safe aiming at 25%.<br><br>Even the founders who fail don&apos;t seem to have such a bad time.  Of
those first eight startups, three are now probably dead.  In two
cases the founders just went on to do other things at the end of
the summer.   I don&apos;t think they were traumatized by the experience.
The closest to a traumatic failure was Kiko, whose founders kept
working on their startup for a whole year before being squashed by
Google Calendar.  But they ended up happy.  They sold their software
on eBay for a quarter of a million dollars.  After they paid back
their angel investors, they had about a year&apos;s salary each.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font>
Then they immediately went on to start a new and much more exciting
startup, <a href="http://justin.tv">Justin.TV</a>.<br><br>So here is an even more striking statistic: 0% of that first batch
had a terrible experience.  They had ups and downs, like every
startup, but I don&apos;t think any would have traded it for a job in a
cubicle.  And that statistic is probably not an anomaly.  Whatever
our long-term success rate ends up being, I think the rate of people
who wish they&apos;d gotten a regular job will stay close to 0%.<br><br>The big mystery to me is: why don&apos;t more people start startups?  If
nearly everyone who does it prefers it to a regular job, and a
significant percentage get rich, why doesn&apos;t everyone want to do
this?  A lot of people think we get thousands of applications for
each funding cycle.  In fact we usually only get several hundred.
Why don&apos;t more people apply?  And while it must seem to anyone
watching this world that startups are popping up like crazy, the
number is small compared to the number of people with the necessary
skills.  The great majority of programmers still go straight from
college to cubicle, and stay there.<br><br>It seems like people are not acting in their own interest.  What&apos;s
going on?   Well, I can answer that.  Because of Y Combinator&apos;s
position at the very start of the venture funding process, we&apos;re
probably the world&apos;s leading experts on the psychology of people
who aren&apos;t sure if they want to start a company.<br><br>There&apos;s nothing wrong with being unsure.  If you&apos;re a hacker thinking
about starting a startup and hesitating before taking the leap,
you&apos;re part of a grand tradition.  Larry and Sergey seem to have
felt the same before they started Google, and so did Jerry and Filo
before they started Yahoo.  In fact, I&apos;d guess the most successful
startups are the ones started by uncertain hackers rather than
gung-ho business guys.<br><br>We have some evidence to support this.  Several of the most successful
startups we&apos;ve funded told us later that they only decided to apply
at the last moment.  Some decided only hours before the deadline.<br><br>The way to deal with uncertainty is to analyze it into components.
Most people who are reluctant to do something have about eight
different reasons mixed together in their heads, and don&apos;t know
themselves which are biggest.  Some will be justified and some
bogus, but unless you know the relative proportion of each, you
don&apos;t know whether your overall uncertainty is mostly justified or
mostly bogus.<br><br>So I&apos;m going to list all the components of people&apos;s reluctance to
start startups, and explain which are real.  Then would-be founders
can use this as a checklist to examine their own feelings.<br><br>I admit my goal is to increase your self-confidence.  But there are
two things different here from the usual confidence-building exercise.
One is that I&apos;m motivated to be honest.  Most people in the
confidence-building business have already achieved their goal when
you buy the book or pay to attend the seminar where they tell you
how great you are.  Whereas if I encourage people to start startups
who shouldn&apos;t, I make my own life worse.  If I encourage too many
people to apply to Y Combinator, it just means more work for me,
because I have to read all the applications.<br><br>The other thing that&apos;s going to be different is my approach.  Instead
of being positive, I&apos;m going to be negative.  Instead of telling
you &quot;come on, you can do it&quot; I&apos;m going to consider all the reasons
you aren&apos;t doing it, and show why most (but not all) should be
ignored.  We&apos;ll start with the one everyone&apos;s born with.<br><br><b>1. Too young</b><br><br>A lot of people think they&apos;re too young to start a startup.  Many
are right.  The median age worldwide is about 27, so probably a
third of the population can truthfully say they&apos;re too young.<br><br>What&apos;s too young?  One of our goals with Y Combinator was to discover
the lower bound on the age of startup founders.  It always seemed
to us that investors were too conservative here&#x2014;that they wanted
to fund professors, when really they should be funding grad students
or even undergrads.<br><br>The main thing we&apos;ve discovered from pushing the edge of this
envelope is not where the edge is, but how fuzzy it is.  The outer
limit may be as low as 16.  We don&apos;t look beyond 18 because people
younger than that can&apos;t legally enter into contracts.  But the most
successful founder we&apos;ve funded so far, Sam Altman, was 19 at the
time.<br><br>Sam Altman, however, is an outlying data point.  When he was 19,
he seemed like he had a 40 year old inside him.  There are other
19 year olds who are 12 inside.<br><br>There&apos;s a reason we have a distinct word &quot;adult&quot; for people over a
certain age.  There is a threshold you cross.  It&apos;s conventionally
fixed at 21, but different people cross it at greatly varying ages.
You&apos;re old enough to start a startup if you&apos;ve crossed this threshold,
whatever your age.<br><br>How do you tell?  There are a couple tests adults use.  I realized
these tests existed after meeting Sam Altman, actually.  I noticed
that I felt like I was talking to someone much older.  Afterward I
wondered, what am I even measuring?  What made him seem older?<br><br>One test adults use is whether you still have the kid flake reflex.
When you&apos;re a little kid and you&apos;re asked to do something hard, you
can cry and say &quot;I can&apos;t do it&quot; and the adults will probably let
you off.  As a kid there&apos;s a magic button you can press by saying
&quot;I&apos;m just a kid&quot; that will get you out of most difficult situations.
Whereas adults, by definition, are not allowed to flake.  They still
do, of course, but when they do they&apos;re ruthlessly pruned.<br><br>The other way to tell an adult is by how they react to a challenge.
Someone who&apos;s not yet an adult will tend to respond to a challenge
from an adult in a way that acknowledges their dominance.  If an
adult says &quot;that&apos;s a stupid idea,&quot; a kid will either crawl away
with his tail between his legs, or rebel.  But rebelling presumes
inferiority as much as submission.  The adult response to
&quot;that&apos;s a stupid idea,&quot; is simply to look the other person in the
eye and say &quot;Really?  Why do you think so?&quot;<br><br>There are a lot of adults who still react childishly to challenges,
of course.  What you don&apos;t often find are kids who react to challenges
like adults.  When you do, you&apos;ve found an adult, whatever their
age.<br><br><b>2. Too inexperienced</b><br><br>I once wrote that startup founders should be at least 23, and that
people should work for another company for a few years before
starting their own.  I no longer believe that, and what changed my
mind is the example of the startups we&apos;ve funded.<br><br>I still think 23 is a better age than 21.  But the best way to get
experience if you&apos;re 21 is to start a startup.  So, paradoxically,
if you&apos;re too inexperienced to start a startup, what you should do
is start one.  That&apos;s a way more efficient cure for inexperience
than a normal job.  In fact, getting a normal job may actually make
you less able to start a startup, by turning you into a tame animal
who thinks he needs an office to work in and a product manager to
tell him what software to write.<br><br>What really convinced me of this was the Kikos.  They started a
startup right out of college.  Their inexperience caused them to
make a lot of mistakes.  But by the time we funded their second
startup, a year later, they had become extremely formidable.  They
were certainly not tame animals.  And there is no way they&apos;d have
grown so much if they&apos;d spent that year working at Microsoft, or
even Google.  They&apos;d still have been diffident junior programmers.<br><br>So now I&apos;d advise people to go ahead and start startups right out
of college.  There&apos;s no better time to take risks than when you&apos;re
young.  Sure, you&apos;ll probably fail.  But even failure will get you
to the ultimate goal faster than getting a job.<br><br>It worries me a bit to be saying this, because in effect we&apos;re
advising people to educate themselves by failing at our expense,
but it&apos;s the truth.<br><br><b>3. Not determined enough</b><br><br>You need a lot of determination to succeed as a startup founder.
It&apos;s probably the single best predictor of success.<br><br>Some people may not be determined enough to make it.  It&apos;s
hard for me to say for sure, because I&apos;m so determined that I can&apos;t
imagine what&apos;s going on in the heads of people who aren&apos;t.  But I
know they exist.<br><br>Most hackers probably underestimate their determination.  I&apos;ve seen
a lot become visibly more determined as they get used to running a 
startup.  I can think of
several we&apos;ve funded who would have been delighted at first to be
bought for $2 million, but are now set on world domination.<br><br>How can you tell if you&apos;re determined enough, when Larry and Sergey
themselves were unsure at first about starting a company?  I&apos;m
guessing here, but I&apos;d say the test is whether you&apos;re sufficiently
driven to work on your own projects.  Though they may have been
unsure whether they wanted to start a company, it doesn&apos;t seem as
if Larry and Sergey were meek little research assistants, obediently
doing their advisors&apos; bidding.  They started projects of their own.<br><br>
<b>4. Not smart enough</b><br><br>You may need to be moderately smart to succeed as a startup founder.
But if you&apos;re worried about this, you&apos;re probably mistaken.  If
you&apos;re smart enough to worry that you might not be smart enough to
start a startup, you probably are.<br><br>And in any case, starting a startup just doesn&apos;t require that much
intelligence.  Some startups do.  You have to be good at math to
write Mathematica.  But most companies do more mundane stuff where
the decisive factor is effort, not brains.  Silicon Valley can warp
your perspective on this, because there&apos;s a cult of smartness here.
People who aren&apos;t smart at least try to act that way.  But if you
think it takes a lot of intelligence to get rich, try spending a
couple days in some of the fancier bits of New York or LA.<br><br>If you don&apos;t think you&apos;re smart enough to start a startup doing
something technically difficult, just write enterprise software.
Enterprise software companies aren&apos;t technology companies, they&apos;re
sales companies, and sales depends mostly on effort.<br><br><b>5. Know nothing about business</b><br><br>This is another variable whose coefficient should be zero.  You
don&apos;t need to know anything about business to start a startup.  The
initial focus should be the product.  All you need to know in this
phase is how to build things people want.  If you succeed, you&apos;ll
have to think about how to make money from it.  But this is so easy
you can pick it up on the fly.<br><br>I get a fair amount of flak for telling founders just to make
something great and not worry too much about making money.  And yet
all the empirical evidence points that way: pretty much 100% of
startups that make something popular manage to make money from it.
And acquirers tell me privately that revenue is not what they buy
startups for, but their strategic value.  Which means, because they
made something people want.  Acquirers know the rule holds for them
too: if users love you, you can always make money from that somehow,
and if they don&apos;t, the cleverest business model in the world won&apos;t
save you.<br><br>So why do so many people argue with me?  I think one reason is that
they hate the idea that a bunch of twenty year olds could get rich
from building something cool that doesn&apos;t make any money.  They
just don&apos;t want that to be possible.  But how possible it is doesn&apos;t
depend on how much they want it to be.<br><br>For a while it annoyed me to hear myself described as some kind of
irresponsible pied piper, leading impressionable young hackers down
the road to ruin.  But now I realize this kind of controversy is a
sign of a good idea.<br><br>The most valuable truths are the ones most people don&apos;t believe.
They&apos;re like undervalued stocks.  If you start with them, you&apos;ll
have the whole field to yourself.  So when you find an idea you
know is good but most people disagree with, you should not
merely ignore their objections, but push aggressively in that
direction.  In this case, that means you should seek out ideas that
would be popular but seem hard to make money from.<br><br>We&apos;ll bet a seed round you can&apos;t make something popular that we
can&apos;t figure out how to make money from.<br><br><b>6. No cofounder</b><br><br>Not having a cofounder is a real problem.  A startup is too much
for one person to bear.  And though we differ from other investors
on a lot of questions, we all agree on this.  All investors, without
exception, are more likely to fund you with a cofounder than without.<br><br>We&apos;ve funded two single founders, but in both cases we suggested
their first priority should be to find a cofounder.  Both did.  But
we&apos;d have preferred them to have cofounders before they applied.
It&apos;s not super hard to get a cofounder for a project that&apos;s just
been funded, and we&apos;d rather have cofounders committed enough to
sign up for something super hard.<br><br>If you don&apos;t have a cofounder, what should you do?  Get one.  It&apos;s
more important than anything else.  If there&apos;s no one where you
live who wants to start a startup with you, move where there are
people who do.  If no one wants to work with you on your current
idea, switch to an idea people want to work on.<br><br>If you&apos;re still in school, you&apos;re surrounded by potential cofounders.
A few years out it gets harder to find them.  Not only do you have
a smaller pool to draw from, but most already have jobs, and perhaps
even families to support.  So if you had friends in college you
used to scheme about startups with, stay in touch with them as well
as you can.  That may help keep the dream alive.<br><br>It&apos;s possible you could meet a cofounder through something like a
user&apos;s group or a conference.  But I wouldn&apos;t be too optimistic.
You need to work with someone to know whether you want them as a
cofounder.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The real lesson to draw from this is not how to find a cofounder,
but that you should start startups when you&apos;re young and there are
lots of them around.<br><br><b>7. No idea</b><br><br>In a sense, it&apos;s not a problem if you don&apos;t have a good idea, because
most startups change their idea anyway.  In the average Y Combinator
startup, I&apos;d guess 70% of the idea is new at the end of the
first three months.  Sometimes it&apos;s 100%.<br><br>In fact, we&apos;re so sure the founders are more important than the
initial idea that we&apos;re going to try something new this funding
cycle. We&apos;re going to let people apply with no idea at all.  If you
want, you can answer the question on the application form that asks
what you&apos;re going to do with &quot;We have no idea.&quot;  If you seem really
good we&apos;ll accept you anyway.  We&apos;re confident we can sit down with
you and cook up some promising project.<br><br>Really this just codifies what we do already.  We put little weight
on the idea.  We ask mainly out of politeness.  The kind of question
on the application form that we really care about is the one where
we ask what cool things you&apos;ve made.  If what you&apos;ve made is version
one of a promising startup, so much the better, but the main thing
we care about is whether you&apos;re good at making things.  Being lead
developer of a popular open source project counts almost as much.<br><br>That solves the problem if you get funded by Y Combinator.  What
about in the general case?  Because in another sense, it is a problem
if you don&apos;t have an idea.  If you start a startup with no idea,
what do you do next?<br><br>So here&apos;s the brief recipe for getting startup ideas.  Find something
that&apos;s missing in your own life, and supply that need&#x2014;no matter
how specific to you it seems.  Steve Wozniak built himself a computer;
who knew so many other people would want them?  A need that&apos;s narrow
but genuine is a better starting point than one that&apos;s broad but
hypothetical.  So even if the problem is simply that you don&apos;t have
a date on Saturday night, if you can think of a way to fix that by
writing software, you&apos;re onto something, because a lot of other
people have the same problem.<br><br><b>8. No room for more startups</b><br><br>A lot of people look at the ever-increasing number of startups and
think &quot;this can&apos;t continue.&quot;  Implicit in their thinking is a
fallacy: that there is some limit on the number of startups there
could be.  But this is false.  No one claims there&apos;s any limit on
the number of people who can work for salary at 1000-person companies.
Why should there be any limit on the number who can work for equity
at 5-person companies? 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Nearly everyone who works is satisfying some kind of need.  Breaking
up companies into smaller units doesn&apos;t make those needs go away.
Existing needs would probably get satisfied more efficiently by a
network of startups than by a few giant, hierarchical organizations,
but I don&apos;t think that would mean less opportunity, because satisfying
current needs would lead to more.  Certainly this tends to be the
case in individuals.  Nor is there anything wrong with that.  We
take for granted things that medieval kings would have considered
effeminate luxuries, like whole buildings heated to spring temperatures
year round.  And if things go well, our descendants will take for
granted things we would consider shockingly luxurious.  There is
no absolute standard for material wealth.  Health care is a component
of it, and that alone is a black hole.  For the foreseeable future,
people will want ever more material wealth, so there is no limit
to the amount of work available for companies, and for startups in
particular.<br><br>Usually the limited-room fallacy is not expressed directly.  Usually
it&apos;s implicit in statements like &quot;there are only so many startups
Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo can buy.&quot;  Maybe, though the list of
acquirers is a lot longer than that.  And whatever you think of
other acquirers, Google is not stupid.  The reason big companies
buy startups is that they&apos;ve created something valuable.  And why
should there be any limit to the number of valuable startups companies
can acquire, any more than there is a limit to the amount of wealth
individual people want?  Maybe there would be practical limits on
the number of startups any one acquirer could assimilate, but if
there is value to be had, in the form of upside that founders are
willing to forgo in return for an immediate payment, acquirers will
evolve to consume it.  Markets are pretty smart that way.<br><br><b>9. Family to support</b><br><br>This one is real.  I wouldn&apos;t advise anyone with a family to start
a startup.  I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s a bad idea, just that I don&apos;t want
to take responsibility for advising it.  I&apos;m willing to take
responsibility for telling 22 year olds to start startups.  So what
if they fail?  They&apos;ll learn a lot, and that job at Microsoft will
still be waiting for them if they need it.  But I&apos;m not prepared
to cross moms.<br><br>What you can do, if you have a family and want to start a startup,
is start a consulting business you can then gradually turn into a
product business.  Empirically the chances of pulling that off seem
very small. You&apos;re never going to produce Google this way.  But at
least you&apos;ll never be without an income.<br><br>Another way to decrease the risk is to join an existing startup
instead of starting your own.  Being one of the first employees of
a startup is a lot like being a founder, in both the good ways and
the bad.  You&apos;ll be roughly 1/n^2 founder, where n is your employee
number.<br><br>As with the question of cofounders, the real lesson here is to start
startups when you&apos;re young.<br><br><b>10. Independently wealthy</b><br><br>This is my excuse for not starting a startup.  Startups are stressful.
Why do it if you don&apos;t need the money?  For every &quot;serial entrepreneur,&quot;
there are probably twenty sane ones who think &quot;Start another
company?  Are you crazy?&quot;<br><br>I&apos;ve come close to starting new startups a couple times, but I
always pull back because I don&apos;t want four years of my life to be
consumed by random schleps.  I know this business well enough to
know you can&apos;t do it half-heartedly.  What makes a good startup
founder so dangerous is his willingness to endure infinite schleps.<br><br>There is a bit of a problem with retirement, though.  Like a lot
of people, I like to work.  And one of the many weird little problems
you discover when you get rich is that a lot of the interesting
people you&apos;d like to work with are not rich.  They need to work at
something that pays the bills.  Which means if you want to have
them as colleagues, you have to work at something that pays the
bills too, even though you don&apos;t need to.  I think this is what
drives a lot of serial entrepreneurs, actually.<br><br>That&apos;s why I love working on Y Combinator so much.  It&apos;s an excuse
to work on something interesting with people I like.<br><br><b>11.  Not ready for commitment</b><br><br>This was my reason for not starting a startup for most of my twenties.
Like a lot of people that age, I valued freedom most of all.  I was
reluctant to do anything that required a commitment of more than a
few months.  Nor would I have wanted to do anything that completely
took over my life the way a startup does.  And that&apos;s fine.  If you
want to spend your time travelling around, or playing in a band,
or whatever, that&apos;s a perfectly legitimate reason not to start a
company.<br><br>If you start a startup that succeeds, it&apos;s going to consume at least
three or four years.  (If it fails, you&apos;ll be done a lot quicker.)
So you shouldn&apos;t do it if you&apos;re not ready for commitments on that
scale.  Be aware, though, that if you get a regular job, you&apos;ll
probably end up working there for as long as a startup would take,
and you&apos;ll find you have much less spare time than you might expect.
So if you&apos;re ready to clip on that ID badge and go to that orientation
session, you may also be ready to start that startup.<br><br><b>12.  Need for structure</b><br><br>I&apos;m told there are people who need structure in their lives.  This
seems to be a nice way of saying they need someone to tell them
what to do.  I believe such people exist.  There&apos;s plenty of empirical
evidence: armies, religious cults, and so on.  They may even be the
majority.<br><br>If you&apos;re one of these people, you probably shouldn&apos;t start a
startup.  In fact, you probably shouldn&apos;t even go to work for one.
In a good startup, you don&apos;t get told what to do very much.  There
may be one person whose job title is CEO, but till the company has
about twelve people no one should be telling anyone what to do.
That&apos;s too inefficient.  Each person should just do what they need
to without anyone telling them.<br><br>If that sounds like a recipe for chaos, think about a soccer team.
Eleven people manage to work together in quite complicated ways,
and yet only in occasional emergencies does anyone tell anyone else
what to do.  A reporter once asked David Beckham if there were any
language problems at Real Madrid, since the players were from about
eight different countries.  He said it was never an issue, because
everyone was so good they never had to talk.  They all just did the
right thing.<br><br>How do you tell if you&apos;re independent-minded enough to start a
startup?  If you&apos;d bristle at the suggestion that you aren&apos;t, then
you probably are.<br><br><b>13. Fear of uncertainty</b><br><br>Perhaps some people are deterred from starting startups because
they don&apos;t like the uncertainty.  If you go to work for Microsoft,
you can predict fairly accurately what the next few years will be
like&#x2014;all too accurately, in fact.  If you start a startup, anything
might happen.<br><br>Well, if you&apos;re troubled by uncertainty, I can solve that problem
for you: if you start a startup, it will probably fail.  Seriously, 
though, this is not a bad way to think
about the whole experience.  Hope for the best, but expect the
worst.  In the worst case, it will at least be interesting.  In the
best case you might get rich.<br><br>No one will blame you if the startup tanks, so long as you made a
serious effort.  There may once have been a time when employers
would regard that as a mark against you, but they wouldn&apos;t now.  I
asked managers at big companies, and they all said they&apos;d prefer
to hire someone who&apos;d tried to start a startup and failed over
someone who&apos;d spent the same time working at a big company.<br><br>Nor will investors hold it against you, as long as you didn&apos;t fail
out of laziness or incurable stupidity.   I&apos;m told there&apos;s a lot
of stigma attached to failing in other places&#x2014;in Europe, for
example.  Not here.  In America, companies, like practically
everything else, are disposable.<br><br><b>14. Don&apos;t realize what you&apos;re avoiding</b><br><br>One reason people who&apos;ve been out in the world for a year or two
make better founders than people straight from college is that they
know what they&apos;re avoiding.  If their startup fails, they&apos;ll have
to get a job, and they know how much jobs suck.<br><br>If you&apos;ve had summer jobs in college, you may think you know what
jobs are like, but you probably don&apos;t.  Summer jobs at technology
companies are not real jobs.  If you get a summer job as a waiter,
that&apos;s a real job.  Then you have to carry your weight.  But software
companies don&apos;t hire students for the summer as a source of cheap
labor.  They do it in the hope of recruiting them when they graduate.
So while they&apos;re happy if you produce, they don&apos;t expect you to.<br><br>That will change if you get a real job after you graduate.  Then
you&apos;ll have to earn your keep.  And since most of what big companies
do is boring, you&apos;re going to have to work on boring stuff.  Easy,
compared to college, but boring.  At first it may seem cool to get
paid for doing easy stuff, after paying to do hard stuff in college.
But that wears off after a few months.  Eventually it gets demoralizing
to work on dumb stuff, even if it&apos;s easy and you get paid a lot.<br><br>And that&apos;s not the worst of it.  The thing that really sucks about
having a regular job is the expectation that you&apos;re supposed to be
there at certain times.  Even Google is afflicted with this,
apparently.  And what this means, as everyone who&apos;s had a regular
job can tell you, is that there are going to be times when you have
absolutely no desire to work on anything, and you&apos;re going to have
to go to work anyway and sit in front of your screen and pretend
to.  To someone who likes work, as most good hackers do, this is
torture.<br><br>In a startup, you skip all that.  There&apos;s no concept of office hours
in most startups.  Work and life just get mixed together.  But the
good thing about that is that no one minds if you have a life at
work.  In a startup you can do whatever you want most of the time.
If you&apos;re a founder, what you want to do most of the time is work.
But you never have to pretend to.<br><br>If you took a nap in your office in a big company, it would seem
unprofessional.  But if you&apos;re starting a startup and you fall
asleep in the middle of the day, your cofounders will just assume
you were tired.<br><br><b>15. Parents want you to be a doctor</b><br><br>A significant number of would-be startup founders are probably
dissuaded from doing it by their parents.  I&apos;m not going to say you
shouldn&apos;t listen to them.  Families are entitled to their own
traditions, and who am I to argue with them?  But I will give you
a couple reasons why a safe career might not be what your parents
really want for you.<br><br>One is that parents tend to be more conservative for their kids
than they would be for themselves.  This is actually a rational
response to their situation.  Parents end up sharing more of their
kids&apos; ill fortune than good fortune.  Most parents don&apos;t mind this;
it&apos;s part of the job; but it does tend to make them excessively
conservative.  And erring on the side of conservatism is still
erring.  In almost everything, reward is proportionate to risk.  So
by protecting their kids from risk, parents are, without realizing
it, also protecting them from rewards.  If they saw that, they&apos;d
want you to take more risks.<br><br>The other reason parents may be mistaken is that, like generals,
they&apos;re always fighting the last war.  If they want you to be a
doctor, odds are it&apos;s not just because they want you to help the
sick, but also because it&apos;s a prestigious and lucrative career.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
But not so lucrative or prestigious as it was when their
opinions were formed.  When I was a kid in the seventies, a doctor
was <i>the</i> thing to be.  There was a sort of golden triangle involving
doctors, Mercedes 450SLs, and tennis.  All three vertices now seem
pretty dated.<br><br>The parents who want you to be a doctor may simply not realize how
much things have changed.  Would they be that unhappy if you were
Steve Jobs instead?  So I think the way to deal with your parents&apos;
opinions about what you should do is to treat them like feature
requests.  Even if your only goal is to please them, the way to do
that is not simply to give them what they ask for.  Instead think
about why they&apos;re asking for something, and see if there&apos;s a better
way to give them what they need.<br><br><b>16.  A job is the default</b><br><br>This leads us to the last and probably most powerful reason people
get regular jobs: it&apos;s the default thing to do.  Defaults are
enormously powerful, precisely because they operate without any
conscious choice.<br><br>To almost everyone except criminals, it seems an axiom that if you
need money, you should get a job.  Actually this tradition is not
much more than a hundred years old.  Before that, the default way
to make a living was by farming.  It&apos;s a bad plan to treat something
only a hundred years old as an axiom.  By historical standards,
that&apos;s something that&apos;s changing pretty rapidly.<br><br>We may be seeing another such change right now.  I&apos;ve read a lot
of economic history, and I understand the startup world pretty well,
and it now seems to me fairly likely that we&apos;re seeing the beginning
of a change like the one from farming to manufacturing.<br><br>And you know what?  If you&apos;d been around when that change began
(around 1000 in Europe) it would have seemed to nearly everyone
that running off to the city to make your fortune was a crazy thing
to do.  Though serfs were in principle forbidden to leave their
manors, it can&apos;t have been that hard to run away to a city.  There
were no guards patrolling the perimeter of the village.  What
prevented most serfs from leaving was that it seemed insanely risky.
Leave one&apos;s plot of land?  Leave the people you&apos;d spent your whole
life with, to live in a giant city of three or four thousand complete
strangers?  How would you live?  How would you get food, if you
didn&apos;t grow it?<br><br>Frightening as it seemed to them, it&apos;s now the default with us to
live by our wits.  So if it seems risky to you to start a startup,
think how risky it once seemed to your ancestors to live as we do
now.  Oddly enough, the people who know this best are the very ones
trying to get you to stick to the old model.  How can Larry and
Sergey say you should come work as their employee, when they didn&apos;t
get jobs themselves?<br><br>Now we look back on medieval peasants and wonder how they stood it.
How grim it must have been to till the same fields your whole life
with no hope of anything better, under the thumb of lords and priests
you had to give all your surplus to and acknowledge as your masters.
I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if one day people look back on what we
consider a normal job in the same way.  How grim it would be to
commute every day to a cubicle in some soulless office complex, and
be told what to do by someone you had to acknowledge as a boss&#x2014;someone 
who could call you into their office and say &quot;take a seat,&quot;
and you&apos;d sit!  Imagine having to ask <i>permission</i> to release
software to users.  Imagine being sad on Sunday afternoons because
the weekend was almost over, and tomorrow you&apos;d have to get up and
go to work.  How did they stand it?<br><br>It&apos;s exciting to think we may be on the cusp of another shift like
the one from farming to manufacturing.  That&apos;s why I care about
startups.  Startups aren&apos;t interesting just because they&apos;re a way
to make a lot of money.  I couldn&apos;t care less about other ways to
do that, like speculating in securities.  At most those are interesting
the way puzzles are.  There&apos;s more going on with startups.  They
may represent one of those rare, historic shifts in the way 
<a href="wealth.html">wealth</a> is created.<br><br>That&apos;s ultimately what drives us to work on Y Combinator.  We want
to make money, if only so we don&apos;t have to stop doing it, but that&apos;s
not the main goal.  There have only been a handful of these great
economic shifts in human history.  It would be an amazing hack to
make one happen faster.<br><br><br><br>

There need to be some number of big companies to acquire the
startups, so the number of big companies couldn&apos;t decrease to zero.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Thought experiment: If doctors did the same work, but as
impoverished outcasts, which parents would still want their kids
to be doctors?<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert

I was talking
to a young startup founder about how Google was different from
Yahoo.  I said that Yahoo had been warped from the start by
their fear of Microsoft.  That was why they&apos;d positioned themselves
as a &quot;media company&quot; instead of a technology company.  Then I looked
at his face and realized he didn&apos;t understand.  It was as if I&apos;d
told him how much girls liked Barry Manilow in the mid
80s.  Barry who?<br><br>Microsoft?  He didn&apos;t say anything, but I could tell he didn&apos;t quite
believe anyone would be frightened of them.<br><br>Microsoft cast
a shadow over the software world for almost 20 years
starting in the late 80s.
I can remember when it was IBM before them.  I mostly ignored this
shadow.  I never used Microsoft software, so it only affected me
indirectly&#x2014;for example, in the spam I got from botnets.  And
because I wasn&apos;t paying attention, I didn&apos;t notice when the shadow
disappeared.<br><br>But it&apos;s gone now.  I can sense that.  No one is even afraid of
Microsoft anymore.  They still make a lot of money&#x2014;so does IBM,
for that matter.  But they&apos;re not dangerous.<br><br>When did Microsoft die, and of what?  I know they seemed dangerous
as late as 2001, because I wrote an <a href="road.html">essay</a> then 
about how they were
less dangerous than they seemed.   I&apos;d guess they were dead by 2005.
I know when we started Y Combinator we didn&apos;t worry about Microsoft
as competition for the startups we funded.  In fact, we&apos;ve never
even invited them to the demo days we organize for startups to
present to investors.  We invite Yahoo and Google and some other
Internet companies, but we&apos;ve never bothered to invite Microsoft.
Nor has anyone there ever even sent us an email.  They&apos;re in a
different world.<br><br>What killed them?  Four things, I think, all of them occurring
simultaneously in the mid 2000s.<br><br>The most obvious is Google.  There can only be one big man in town,
and they&apos;re clearly it.  Google is the most dangerous company
now by far, in both the good and bad senses of the word.  Microsoft
can at best <a href="http://live.com">limp</a> along afterward.<br><br>When did Google take the lead?  There will be a tendency to push
it back to their IPO in August 2004, but they weren&apos;t setting the
terms of the debate then.  I&apos;d say they took the lead in
2005.  Gmail was one of the things that put them over the edge.
Gmail showed they could do more than search.<br><br>Gmail also showed how much you could do with web-based software,
if you took advantage of what later came to be called &quot;Ajax.&quot; And
that was the second cause of Microsoft&apos;s death: everyone can see the
desktop is over.  It now seems inevitable that applications will
live on the web&#x2014;not just email, but everything, right up to
<a href="http://snipshot.com">Photoshop</a>.  Even Microsoft sees that now.<br><br>Ironically, Microsoft unintentionally helped create Ajax.  The x
in Ajax is from the XMLHttpRequest object, which lets the browser
communicate with the server in the background while displaying a page.
(Originally the only way to communicate with the server was to 
ask for a new page.) XMLHttpRequest was created by Microsoft in the late 90s
because they needed it for Outlook.  What they didn&apos;t realize was
that it would be useful to a lot of other people too&#x2014;in fact, to
anyone who wanted to make web apps work like desktop ones.<br><br>The other critical component of Ajax is Javascript, the programming
language that runs in the browser.  Microsoft saw the danger of
Javascript and tried to keep it broken for as long as they could.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font> 
But eventually the open source world won, by producing
Javascript libraries that grew over the brokenness of Explorer
the way a tree grows over barbed wire.<br><br>The third cause of Microsoft&apos;s death was broadband Internet.  Anyone
who cares can have fast Internet access
now.  And the bigger the pipe to the server, the less you need the
desktop.<br><br>The last nail in the coffin came, of all places, from Apple.  
Thanks to OS X, Apple has come back from the dead in a way
that is extremely rare in technology.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>
Their victory is so complete that I&apos;m now surprised when I come across
a computer running Windows.  Nearly all the people we fund at Y
Combinator use Apple laptops.  It was the same in the audience at 
<a href="http://www.bosstalks.com/StartupSchool2007/all_macs_and_all_writing.jpg">startup
school</a>.  All the computer people use Macs or Linux now.  Windows is for
grandmas, like Macs used to be in the 90s.  So not only does the
desktop no longer matter, no one who cares about computers uses
Microsoft&apos;s anyway.<br><br>And of course Apple has Microsoft on the run in music
too, with TV and phones on the way.<br><br>I&apos;m glad Microsoft is dead.  They were like Nero or 
Commodus&#x2014;evil
in the way only inherited power can make you.  Because remember,
the Microsoft monopoly didn&apos;t begin with Microsoft.  They got it
from IBM.  The software business was overhung by a
monopoly from about the mid-1950s to about 2005.  For practically
its whole existence, that is.  One of the reasons &quot;Web 2.0&quot; has
such an air of euphoria about it is the feeling, conscious or not,
that this era of monopoly may finally be over.<br><br>Of course, as a hacker I can&apos;t help thinking about how something
broken could be fixed.  Is there some way Microsoft could come back?
In principle, yes.  To see how, envision two things: (a) the amount
of cash Microsoft now has on hand, and (b) Larry and Sergey making
the rounds of all the search engines ten years ago trying to sell
the idea for Google for a million dollars, and being turned down
by everyone.<br><br>The surprising fact is, brilliant hackers&#x2014;dangerously brilliant
hackers&#x2014;can be had very cheaply, by the standards of a
company as rich as Microsoft.  They can&apos;t 
<a href="hiring.html">hire</a> smart people anymore,
but they could buy as many as they wanted for only an order of magnitude 
more. So if they wanted to be a contender
again, this is how they could do it:
<ol>
<li> Buy all the good &quot;Web 2.0&quot; startups.  They could get substantially
    all of them for less than they&apos;d have to pay for Facebook.<br><br></li><li> Put them all in a building in Silicon Valley, surrounded by
    lead shielding to protect them from any contact with Redmond.
</li></ol>
I feel safe suggesting this, because they&apos;d never do it.  Microsoft&apos;s
biggest weakness is that they still don&apos;t realize how much they
suck.  They still think they can write software in house.  Maybe they
can, by the standards of the desktop world.  But that world ended
a few years ago.<br><br>I already know what the reaction to this essay will be.  Half the
readers will say that Microsoft is still an enormously profitable
company, and that I should be more
careful about drawing conclusions based on what a few people think
in our insular little &quot;Web 2.0&quot; bubble.  The other half, the younger
half, will complain that this is old news.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>See also:</b> <a href="cliffsnotes.html">Microsoft is Dead: the Cliffs Notes</a><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
It doesn&apos;t take a conscious effort to make software incompatible.
All you have to do is not work too hard at fixing bugs&#x2014;which, if
you&apos;re a big company, you produce in copious quantities.  The
situation is analogous to the writing of &quot;<ax href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=subtext+gendered+theory+postmodern+deconstruct">literary
theorists.&quot;  Most don&apos;t try to be obscure; they just don&apos;t make an
effort to be clear.  It wouldn&apos;t pay.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]

Sometimes judging
you correctly is the end goal.  But there&apos;s a second much more
common type of judgement where it isn&apos;t.  We tend to regard all
judgements of us as the first type.  We&apos;d probably be happier if
we realized which are and which aren&apos;t.<br><br>The first type of judgement, the type where judging you is the end
goal, include court cases, grades in classes, and most competitions.
Such judgements can of course be mistaken, but because the goal is
to judge you correctly, there&apos;s usually some kind of appeals process.
If you feel you&apos;ve been misjudged, you can protest that you&apos;ve been
treated unfairly.<br><br>Nearly all the judgements made on children are of this type, so we
get into the habit early in life of thinking that all judgements
are.<br><br>But in fact there is a second much larger class of judgements where
judging you is only a means to something else.  These include college
admissions, hiring and investment decisions, and of course the
judgements made in dating.  This kind of judgement is not really
about you.<br><br>Put yourself in the position of someone selecting players for a
national team.  Suppose for the sake of simplicity that this is a
game with no positions, and that you have to select 20 players.
There will be a few stars who clearly should make the team, and
many players who clearly shouldn&apos;t.  The only place your judgement
makes a difference is in the borderline cases.  Suppose you screw
up and underestimate the 20th best player, causing him not to make
the team, and his place to be taken by the 21st best.  You&apos;ve still
picked a good team.  If the players have the usual distribution of
ability, the 21st best player will be only slightly worse than the
20th best.  Probably the difference between them will be less than
the measurement error.<br><br>The 20th best player may feel he has been misjudged.  But your goal
here wasn&apos;t to provide a service estimating people&apos;s ability.  It
was to pick a team, and if the difference between the 20th and 21st
best players is less than the measurement error, you&apos;ve still done
that optimally.<br><br>It&apos;s a false analogy even to use the word unfair to describe this
kind of misjudgement.  It&apos;s not aimed at producing a correct estimate
of any given individual, but at selecting a reasonably optimal set.<br><br>One thing that leads us astray here is that the selector seems to
be in a position of power.  That makes him seem like a judge.  If
you regard someone judging you as a customer instead of a judge,
the expectation of fairness goes away.  The author of a good novel
wouldn&apos;t complain that readers were <i>unfair</i> for preferring a
potboiler with a racy cover.  Stupid, perhaps, but not unfair.<br><br>Our early training and our self-centeredness combine to make us
believe that every judgement of us is about us.  In fact most aren&apos;t.
This is a rare case where being less self-centered will make people
more confident.  Once you realize how little most people judging
you care about judging you accurately&#x2014;once you realize that because
of the normal distribution of most applicant pools, it matters least
to judge accurately in precisely the cases where judgement has the
most effect&#x2014;you won&apos;t take rejection so personally.<br><br>And curiously enough, taking rejection less personally may help you
to get rejected less often.  If you think someone judging you will
work hard to judge you correctly, you can afford to be passive.
But the more you realize that most judgements are greatly influenced
by random, extraneous factors&#x2014;that most people judging you are
more like a fickle novel buyer than a wise and perceptive 
magistrate&#x2014;the more you realize you can do things to influence the
outcome.<br><br>One good place to apply this principle is in college applications.
Most high school students applying to college do it with the usual
child&apos;s mix of inferiority and self-centeredness: inferiority in
that they assume that admissions committees must be all-seeing;
self-centeredness in that they assume admissions committees care
enough about them to dig down into their application and figure out
whether they&apos;re good or not.  These combine to make applicants
passive in applying and hurt when they&apos;re rejected.  If college
applicants realized how quick and impersonal most selection processes
are, they&apos;d make more effort to sell themselves, and take the outcome
less personally.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.simpleoption.com/empresa/ensayo-dos-tipos-juicios">Spanish Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://ryba4.com/translations/judgement">Russian Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="guidetoinvestors">The Hacker&apos;s Guide to Investors</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">April 2007<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a keynote talk at the 2007 ASES Summit
at Stanford.)</i><br><br>The world of investors is a foreign one to most hackers&#x2014;partly
because investors are so unlike hackers, and partly because they
tend to operate in secret.  I&apos;ve been dealing with this world for
many years, both as a founder and an investor, and I still don&apos;t
fully understand it.<br><br>In this essay I&apos;m going to list some of the more surprising things
I&apos;ve learned about investors.  Some I only learned in the past year.<br><br>Teaching hackers how to deal with investors is probably the second
most important thing we do at Y Combinator.  The most important
thing for a startup is to make something good.  But everyone knows
that&apos;s important.  The dangerous thing about investors is that
hackers don&apos;t know how little they know about this strange world.<br><br><b>1. The investors are what make a startup hub.</b><br><br>About a year ago I tried to figure out what you&apos;d need to reproduce
<a href="siliconvalley.html">Silicon Valley</a>.  I decided the 
critical ingredients were rich people
and nerds&#x2014;investors and founders.  People are all you need to
make technology, and all the other people will move.<br><br>If I had to narrow that down, I&apos;d say investors are the limiting
factor.  Not because they contribute more to the startup, but simply
because they&apos;re least willing to move.  They&apos;re rich.  They&apos;re not
going to move to Albuquerque just because there are some smart
hackers there they could invest in.  Whereas hackers will move to
the Bay Area to find investors.<br><br><b>2. Angel investors are the most critical.</b><br><br>There are several types of investors.  The two main categories are
angels and VCs: VCs invest other people&apos;s money, and angels invest
their own.<br><br>Though they&apos;re less well known, the angel investors are probably
the more critical ingredient in creating a silicon valley.  Most
companies that VCs invest in would never have made it that far if angels
hadn&apos;t invested first.  VCs say between half and three quarters of
companies that raise series A rounds have taken some outside
investment already.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Angels are willing to fund riskier projects than VCs.  They also
give valuable advice, because (unlike VCs) many have been startup
founders themselves.<br><br>Google&apos;s story shows the key role angels play. A lot of people know
Google raised money from Kleiner and Sequoia.  What most don&apos;t realize
is how late.  That VC round was a series B round; the premoney
valuation was $75 million.  Google was already a successful company
at that point.  Really, Google was funded with angel money.<br><br>It may seem odd that the canonical Silicon Valley startup was funded
by angels, but this is not so surprising.  Risk is always proportionate
to reward.  So the most successful startup of all is likely to have
seemed an extremely risky bet at first, and that is exactly the
kind VCs won&apos;t touch.<br><br>Where do angel investors come from?  From other startups.  So startup
hubs like Silicon Valley benefit from something like the marketplace
effect, but shifted in time: startups are there because startups
were there.<br><br><b>3. Angels don&apos;t like publicity.</b><br><br>If angels are so important, why do we hear more about VCs?  Because
VCs like publicity.  They need to market themselves to the investors
who are their &quot;customers&quot;&#x2014;the endowments and pension funds and
rich families whose money they invest&#x2014;and also to founders who
might come to them for funding.<br><br>Angels don&apos;t need to market themselves to investors because they
invest their own money.  Nor do they want to market themselves to
founders: they don&apos;t want random people pestering them with business
plans.  Actually, neither do VCs.  Both angels and VCs get deals
almost exclusively through personal introductions.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The reason VCs want a strong brand is not to draw in more business
plans over the transom, but so they win deals when competing
against other VCs.  Whereas angels are rarely in direct competition,
because (a) they do fewer deals, (b) they&apos;re happy to split them,
and (c) they invest at a point where the stream is broader.<br><br><b>4. Most investors, especially VCs, are not like founders.</b><br><br>Some angels are, or were, hackers.  But most VCs are a different
type of people: they&apos;re dealmakers.<br><br>If you&apos;re a hacker, here&apos;s a thought experiment you can run to
understand why there are basically no hacker VCs: How would you
like a job where you never got to make anything, but instead spent
all your time listening to other people pitch (mostly terrible)
projects, deciding whether to fund them, and sitting on their boards
if you did?  That would not be fun for most hackers.  Hackers like
to make things.  This would be like being an administrator.<br><br>Because most VCs are a different species of people from
founders, it&apos;s hard to know what they&apos;re thinking.  If you&apos;re a
hacker, the last time you had to deal with these guys was in high
school.  Maybe in college you walked past their fraternity on your
way to the lab.  But don&apos;t underestimate them.  They&apos;re as expert
in their world as you are in yours.  What they&apos;re good at is reading
people, and making deals work to their advantage.  Think twice
before you try to beat them at that.<br><br><b>5. Most investors are momentum investors.</b><br><br>Because most investors are dealmakers rather than technology people,
they generally don&apos;t understand what you&apos;re doing.  I knew as a
founder that most VCs didn&apos;t get technology.  I also knew some made
a lot of money.  And yet it never occurred to me till recently to
put those two ideas together and ask &quot;How can VCs make money by
investing in stuff they don&apos;t understand?&quot;<br><br>The answer is that they&apos;re like momentum investors.  You can (or
could once) make a lot of money by noticing sudden changes in stock
prices.  When a stock jumps upward, you buy, and when it suddenly
drops, you sell.  In effect you&apos;re insider trading, without knowing
what you know.  You just know someone knows something, and that&apos;s
making the stock move.<br><br>This is how most venture investors operate.  They don&apos;t try to look
at something and predict whether it will take off.  They win by
noticing that something <i>is</i> taking off a little sooner than everyone
else.  That generates almost as good returns as actually being able
to pick winners.  They may have to pay a little more than they would
if they got in at the very beginning, but only a little.<br><br>Investors always say what they really care about is the team.
Actually what they care most about is your traffic, then what other
investors think, then the team.  If you don&apos;t yet have any traffic,
they fall back on number 2, what other investors think.  And this,
as you can imagine, produces wild oscillations in the &quot;stock price&quot;
of a startup.  One week everyone wants you, and they&apos;re begging not
to be cut out of the deal.  But all it takes is for one big investor
to cool on you, and the next week no one will return your phone
calls.  We regularly have startups go from hot to cold or cold to
hot in a matter of days, and literally nothing has changed.<br><br>There are two ways to deal with this phenomenon.  If you&apos;re feeling
really confident, you can try to ride it.  You can start by asking
a comparatively lowly VC for a small amount of money, and then after
generating interest there, ask more prestigious VCs for larger
amounts, stirring up a crescendo of buzz, and then &quot;sell&quot; at the
top.  This is extremely risky, and takes months even if you succeed.
I wouldn&apos;t try it myself.  My advice is to err on the side of safety:
when someone offers you a decent deal, just take it and get on with
building the company.  Startups win or lose based on the quality
of their product, not the quality of their funding deals.<br><br><b>6. Most investors are looking for big hits.</b><br><br>Venture investors like companies that could go public.  That&apos;s where
the big returns are.  They know the odds of any individual startup
going public are small, but they want to invest in those that at
least have a <i>chance</i> of going public.<br><br>Currently the way VCs seem to operate is to invest in a bunch of
companies, most of which fail, and one of which is Google.  Those
few big wins compensate for losses on their other investments.  What this
means is that most VCs will only invest in you if you&apos;re a potential
Google.  They don&apos;t care about companies that are a safe bet to be
acquired for $20 million.  There needs to be a chance, however
small, of the company becoming really big.<br><br>Angels are different in this respect.  They&apos;re happy to invest in
a company where the most likely outcome is a $20 million acquisition
if they can do it at a low enough valuation.  But of course they
like companies that could go public too.  So having an ambitious
long-term plan pleases everyone.<br><br>If you take VC money, you have to mean it, because the structure
of VC deals prevents early acquisitions.  If you take VC money,
they won&apos;t let you sell early.<br><br><b>7. VCs want to invest large amounts.</b><br><br>The fact that they&apos;re running investment funds makes VCs want to
invest large amounts.  A typical VC fund is now hundreds of millions
of dollars.  If $400 million has to be invested by 10 partners,
they have to invest $40 million each.  VCs usually sit on the boards
of companies they fund.  If the average deal size was $1 million,
each partner would have to sit on 40 boards, which would not be
fun.  So they prefer bigger deals, where they can put a lot of money
to work at once.<br><br>VCs don&apos;t regard you as a bargain if you don&apos;t need a lot of money.
That may even make you less attractive, because it means their
investment creates less of a barrier to entry for competitors.<br><br>Angels are in a different position because they&apos;re investing their
own money.  They&apos;re happy to invest small amounts&#x2014;sometimes as
little as $20,000&#x2014;as long as the potential returns look good
enough.  So if you&apos;re doing something inexpensive, go to angels.<br><br><b>8. Valuations are fiction.</b><br><br>VCs admit that valuations are an artifact.  They decide how much
money you need and how much of the company they want, and those two
constraints yield a valuation.<br><br>Valuations increase as the size of the investment does.  A company
that an angel is willing to put $50,000 into at a valuation of a
million can&apos;t take $6 million from VCs at that valuation.  That
would leave the founders less than a seventh of the company between
them (since the option pool would also come out of that seventh).
Most VCs wouldn&apos;t want that, which is why you never hear of deals
where a VC invests $6 million at a premoney valuation of $1 million.<br><br>If valuations change depending on the amount invested, that shows
how far they are from reflecting any kind of value of the company.<br><br>Since valuations are made up, founders shouldn&apos;t care too much about
them.  That&apos;s not the part to focus on.  In fact, a high valuation
can be a bad thing.  If you take funding at a premoney valuation
of $10 million, you won&apos;t be selling the company for 20.  You&apos;ll
have to sell for over 50 for the VCs to get even a 5x return, which
is low to them.  More likely they&apos;ll want you to hold out for 100.
But needing to get a high price decreases the chance of getting
bought at all; many companies can buy you for $10 million, but only
a handful for 100.  And since a startup is like a pass/fail course
for the founders, what you want to optimize is your chance of a
good outcome, not the percentage of the company you keep.<br><br>So why do founders chase high valuations?  They&apos;re tricked by
misplaced ambition.  They feel they&apos;ve achieved more if they get a
higher valuation.  They usually know other founders, and if they
get a higher valuation they can say &quot;mine is bigger than yours.&quot;
But funding is not the real test.  The real test is the final outcome
for the founder, and getting too high a valuation may just make a
good outcome less likely.<br><br>The one advantage of a high valuation is that you get less dilution.
But there is another less sexy way to achieve that: just take less
money.<br><br><b>9. Investors look for founders like the current stars.</b><br><br>Ten years ago investors were looking for the next Bill Gates.  This
was a mistake, because Microsoft was a very anomalous startup.  They
started almost as a contract programming operation, and the reason
they became huge was that IBM happened to drop the PC standard in
their lap.<br><br>Now all the VCs are looking for the next Larry and Sergey.  This
is a good trend, because Larry and Sergey are closer to the ideal
startup founders.<br><br>Historically investors thought it was important for a founder to
be an expert in business.  So they were willing to fund teams of
MBAs who planned to use the money to pay programmers to build their
product for them.  This is like funding Steve Ballmer in the hope
that the programmer he&apos;ll hire is Bill Gates&#x2014;kind of backward,
as the events of the Bubble showed.  Now most VCs know they should
be funding technical guys.  This is more pronounced among the very
top funds; the lamer ones still want to fund MBAs.<br><br>If you&apos;re a hacker, it&apos;s good news that investors are looking for
Larry and Sergey.  The bad news is, the only investors who can do
it right are the ones who knew them when they were a
couple of CS grad students, not the confident media stars they are
today.  What investors still don&apos;t get is how clueless and tentative
great founders can seem at the very beginning.<br><br><b>10. The contribution of investors tends to be underestimated.</b><br><br>Investors do more for startups than give them money.  They&apos;re helpful
in doing deals and arranging introductions, and some of the smarter
ones, particularly angels, can give good advice about the product.<br><br>In fact, I&apos;d say what separates the great investors from the mediocre
ones is the quality of their advice.  Most investors give advice,
but the top ones give <i>good</i> advice.<br><br>Whatever help investors give a startup tends to be underestimated.
It&apos;s to everyone&apos;s advantage to let the world think the founders
thought of everything.  The goal of the investors is for the company
to become valuable, and the company seems more valuable if it seems
like all the good ideas came from within.<br><br>This trend is compounded by the obsession that the press has with
founders.  In a company founded by two people, 10% of the ideas
might come from the first guy they hire.  Arguably they&apos;ve done a
bad job of hiring otherwise.  And yet this guy will be almost
entirely overlooked by the press.<br><br>I say this as a founder: the contribution of founders is always
overestimated.  The danger here is that new founders, looking at
existing founders, will think that they&apos;re supermen that one couldn&apos;t
possibly equal oneself.  Actually they have a hundred different
types of support people just offscreen making the whole show possible.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>11. VCs are afraid of looking bad.</b><br><br>I&apos;ve been very surprised to discover how timid most VCs are.  They
seem to be afraid of looking bad to their partners, and perhaps
also to the limited partners&#x2014;the people whose money they invest.<br><br>You can measure this fear in how much less risk VCs are willing to
take.  You can tell they won&apos;t make investments for their fund that
they might be willing to make themselves as angels.  Though it&apos;s
not quite accurate to say that VCs are less willing to take risks.
They&apos;re less willing to do things that might look bad.  That&apos;s not
the same thing.<br><br>For example, most VCs would be very reluctant to invest in a startup
founded by a pair of 18 year old hackers, no matter how brilliant,
because if the startup failed their partners could turn on them and
say &quot;What, you invested $x million of our money in a pair of 18
year olds?&quot;  Whereas if a VC invested in a startup founded by
three former banking executives in their 40s who planned to outsource
their product development&#x2014;which to my mind is actually a lot
riskier than investing in a pair of really smart 18 year olds&#x2014;he
couldn&apos;t be faulted, if it failed, for making such an apparently
prudent investment.<br><br>As a friend of mine said, &quot;Most VCs can&apos;t do anything that would
sound bad to the kind of doofuses who run pension funds.&quot; Angels
can take greater risks because they don&apos;t have to answer to anyone.<br><br><b>12. Being turned down by investors doesn&apos;t mean much.</b><br><br>Some founders are quite dejected when they get turned down by
investors.  They shouldn&apos;t take it so much to heart.  To start with,
investors are often wrong.  It&apos;s hard to think of a successful
startup that wasn&apos;t turned down by investors at some point.  Lots
of VCs rejected Google.  So obviously the reaction of investors is
not a very meaningful test.<br><br>Investors will often reject you for what seem to be superficial
reasons.  I read of one VC who 
<a href="http://ricksegal.typepad.com/pmv/2007/02/a_fatal_paper_c.html">turned
down</a> a startup simply because
they&apos;d given away so many little bits of stock that the deal required
too many signatures to close. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
The reason investors can get away
with this is that they see so many deals.  It doesn&apos;t matter if
they underestimate you because of some surface imperfection, because
the next best deal will be <a href="judgement.html">almost as good</a>.  
Imagine picking out
apples at a grocery store.  You grab one with a little bruise.
Maybe it&apos;s just a surface bruise, but why even bother checking when
there are so many other unbruised apples to choose from?<br><br>Investors would be the first to admit they&apos;re often wrong.  So when
you get rejected by investors, don&apos;t think &quot;we suck,&quot; but instead
ask &quot;do we suck?&quot;  Rejection is a question, not an answer.<br><br><b>13. Investors are emotional.</b><br><br>I&apos;ve been surprised to discover how emotional investors can be.
You&apos;d expect them to be cold and calculating, or at least businesslike,
but often they&apos;re not.  I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s their position of power
that makes them this way, or the large sums of money involved, but
investment negotiations can easily turn personal.  If you offend
investors, they&apos;ll leave in a huff.<br><br>A while ago an eminent VC firm offered a series A round to a startup
we&apos;d seed funded.  Then they heard a rival VC firm was also interested.
They were so afraid that they&apos;d be rejected in favor of this other
firm that they gave the startup what&apos;s known as an &quot;exploding
termsheet.&quot;  They had, I think, 24 hours to say yes or no, or the
deal was off.  Exploding termsheets are a somewhat dubious device,
but not uncommon.  What surprised me was their reaction when I
called to talk about it.  I asked if they&apos;d still be interested in
the startup if the rival VC didn&apos;t end up making an offer, and they
said no.  What rational basis could they have had for saying that?
If they thought the startup was worth investing in, what difference
should it make what some other VC thought?  Surely it was their
duty to their limited partners simply to invest in the best
opportunities they found; they should be delighted if the other VC
said no, because it would mean they&apos;d overlooked a good opportunity.
But of course there was no rational basis for their decision.  They
just couldn&apos;t stand the idea of taking this rival firm&apos;s rejects.<br><br>In this case the exploding termsheet was not (or not only) a tactic
to pressure the startup.  It was more like the high school trick
of breaking up with someone before they can break up with you.  In
an <a href="startupfunding.html">earlier essay</a> I said that VCs were a lot like high school girls.
A few VCs have joked about that characterization, but none have
disputed it.<br><br><b>14. The negotiation never stops till the closing.</b><br><br>Most deals, for investment or acquisition, happen in two phases.
There&apos;s an initial phase of negotiation about the big questions.
If this succeeds you get a termsheet, so called because it outlines
the key terms of a deal.  A termsheet is not legally binding,
but it is a definite step.  It&apos;s supposed to mean that a
deal is going to happen, once the lawyers work out all the details.
In theory these details are minor ones; by definition all the
important points are supposed to be covered in the termsheet.<br><br>Inexperience and wishful thinking combine to make founders feel
that when they have a termsheet, they have a deal.  They want there
to be a deal; everyone acts like they have a deal; so there must
be a deal.  But there isn&apos;t and may not be for several months.  A
lot can change for a startup in several months.  It&apos;s not uncommon
for investors and acquirers to get buyer&apos;s remorse.  So you have
to keep pushing, keep selling, all the way to the close.  Otherwise
all the &quot;minor&quot; details left unspecified in the termsheet will be
interpreted to your disadvantage.  The other side may even break
the deal; if they do that, they&apos;ll usually seize on some technicality
or claim you misled them, rather than admitting they changed their
minds.<br><br>It can be hard to keep the pressure on an investor or acquirer all
the way to the closing, because the most effective pressure is
competition from other investors or acquirers, and these tend to
drop away when you get a termsheet.  You should try to stay as close
friends as you can with these rivals, but the most important thing
is just to keep up the momentum in your startup.  The investors or
acquirers chose you because you seemed hot.  Keep doing whatever
made you seem hot.  Keep releasing new features; keep getting new
users; keep getting mentioned in the press and in blogs.<br><br><b>15. Investors like to co-invest.</b><br><br>I&apos;ve been surprised how willing investors are to split deals.  You
might think that if they found a good deal they&apos;d want it all to
themselves, but they seem positively eager to syndicate.  This is
understandable with angels; they invest on a smaller scale and don&apos;t
like to have too much money tied up in any one deal.  But VCs also
share deals a lot.  Why?<br><br>Partly I think this is an artifact of the rule I quoted earlier:
after traffic, VCs care most what other VCs think.  A deal that has
multiple VCs interested in it is more likely to close, so of deals
that close, more will have multiple investors.<br><br>There is one rational reason to want multiple VCs in a deal: Any
investor who co-invests with you is one less investor who could
fund a competitor.  Apparently Kleiner and Sequoia didn&apos;t like
splitting the Google deal, but it did at least have the advantage,
from each one&apos;s point of view, that there probably wouldn&apos;t be a
competitor funded by the other.  Splitting deals thus has similar
advantages to confusing paternity.<br><br>But I think the main reason VCs like splitting deals is the fear
of looking bad.  If another firm shares the deal, then in the event
of failure it will seem to have been a prudent choice&#x2014;a consensus
decision, rather than just the whim of an individual partner.<br><br><b>16. Investors collude.</b><br><br>Investing is not covered by antitrust law.  At least, it better not
be, because investors regularly do things that would be illegal
otherwise.  I know personally of cases where one investor has talked
another out of making a competitive offer, using the promise of
sharing future deals.<br><br>In principle investors are all competing for the same deals, but
the spirit of cooperation is stronger than the spirit of competition.
The reason, again, is that there are so many deals.  Though a
professional investor may have a closer relationship with a founder
he invests in than with other investors, his relationship with the
founder is only going to last a couple years, whereas his relationship
with other firms will last his whole career.  There isn&apos;t so much
at stake in his interactions with other investors, but there will
be a lot of them.  Professional investors are constantly trading
little favors.<br><br>Another reason investors stick together is to preserve the power
of investors as a whole.  So you will not, as of this writing, be
able to get investors into an auction for your series A round.
They&apos;d rather lose the deal than establish a precedent of VCs
competitively bidding against one another.  An efficient startup
funding market may be coming in the distant future; things tend to
move in that direction; but it&apos;s certainly not here now.
<!--
The best way to describe the situation might be to say that VCs
compete intramurally. --><br><br><b>17. Large-scale investors care about their portfolio, not any
individual company.</b><br><br>The reason startups work so well is that everyone with power also
has equity.  The only way any of them can succeed is if they all
do.  This makes everyone naturally pull in the same direction,
subject to differences of opinion about tactics.<br><br>The problem is, larger scale investors don&apos;t have exactly the same
motivation.  Close, but not identical. They don&apos;t need any given
startup to succeed, like founders do, just their portfolio as a
whole to.  So in borderline cases the rational thing for them to
do is to sacrifice unpromising startups.<br><br>Large-scale investors tend to put startups in three categories:
successes, failures, and the &quot;living dead&quot;&#x2014;companies that are
plugging along but don&apos;t seem likely in the immediate future to get
bought or go public.  To the founders, &quot;living dead&quot; sounds harsh.
These companies may be far from failures by ordinary standards. But
they might as well be from a venture investor&apos;s point of view, and
they suck up just as much time and attention as the successes.  So
if such a company has two possible strategies, a conservative one
that&apos;s slightly more likely to work in the end, or a risky one that
within a short time will either yield a giant success or kill the
company, VCs will push for the kill-or-cure option.  To them the
company is already a write-off.  Better to have resolution, one way
or the other, as soon as possible.<br><br>If a startup gets into real trouble, instead of trying to save it
VCs may just sell it at a low price to another of their portfolio
companies.  Philip Greenspun said in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597141"><i>Founders at Work</i></a> that Ars Digita&apos;s VCs did this to them.<br><br><b>18. Investors have different risk profiles from founders.</b><br><br>Most people would rather a 100% chance of $1 million than a 20%
chance of $10 million.  Investors are rich enough to be rational
and prefer the latter.  So they&apos;ll always tend to encourage founders
to keep rolling the dice.  If a company is doing well, investors
will want founders to turn down most acquisition offers.  And indeed,
most startups that turn down acquisition offers ultimately do better.
But it&apos;s still hair-raising for the founders, because they might
end up with nothing.  When someone&apos;s offering to buy you for a price
at which your stock is worth $5 million, saying no is equivalent
to having $5 million and betting it all on one spin of the roulette
wheel.<br><br>Investors will tell you the company is worth more.  And they may
be right.  But that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s wrong to sell.  Any financial
advisor who put all his client&apos;s assets in the stock of a single,
private company would probably lose his license for it.<br><br>More and more, investors are letting founders cash out partially.
That should correct the problem. Most founders have such low standards
that they&apos;ll feel rich with a sum that doesn&apos;t seem huge to investors.
But this custom is spreading too slowly, because VCs are afraid of
seeming irresponsible.  No one wants to be the first VC to give
someone fuck-you money and then actually get told &quot;fuck you.&quot; But
until this does start to happen, we know VCs are being too conservative.<br><br><b>19. Investors vary greatly.</b><br><br>Back when I was a founder I used to think all VCs were the same.
And in fact they do all <a href="http://www.redpoint.com/team/">look</a> 
the same.  They&apos;re all what hackers
call &quot;suits.&quot;  But since I&apos;ve been dealing with VCs more I&apos;ve learned
that some suits are smarter than others.<br><br>They&apos;re also in a business where winners tend to keep winning and
losers to keep losing.  When a VC firm has been successful in the
past, everyone wants funding from them, so they get the pick of all
the new deals.  The self-reinforcing nature of the venture funding
market means that the top ten firms live in a completely different
world from, say, the hundredth.  As well as being smarter, they
tend to be calmer and more upstanding; they don&apos;t need to do iffy
things to get an edge, and don&apos;t want to because they have more
brand to protect.<br><br>There are only two kinds of VCs you want to take money from, if you
have the luxury of choosing: the &quot;top tier&quot; VCs, meaning about the
top 20 or so firms, plus a few new ones that are not among the top
20 only because they haven&apos;t been around long enough.<br><br>It&apos;s particularly important to raise money from a top firm if you&apos;re
a hacker, because they&apos;re more confident.  That means they&apos;re less
likely to stick you with a business guy as CEO, like VCs used to
do in the 90s.  If you seem smart and want to do it, they&apos;ll let
you run the company.<br><br><b>20. Investors don&apos;t realize how much it costs to raise money from
them.</b><br><br>Raising money is a huge time suck at just the point where startups
can least afford it. It&apos;s not unusual for it to take five or six
months to close a funding round.  Six weeks is fast.  And raising
money is not just something you can leave running as a background
process.  When you&apos;re raising money, it&apos;s inevitably the main focus
of the company.  Which means building the product isn&apos;t.<br><br>Suppose a Y Combinator company starts talking to VCs after demo
day, and is successful in raising money from them, closing the deal
after a comparatively short 8 weeks.  Since demo day occurs after
10 weeks, the company is now 18 weeks old.  Raising money, rather
than working on the product, has been the company&apos;s main focus for
44% of its existence.  And mind you, this an example where things
turned out <i>well</i>.<br><br>When a startup does return to working on the product after a funding
round finally closes, it&apos;s as if they were returning to work after
a months-long illness.  They&apos;ve lost most of their momentum.<br><br>Investors have no idea how much they damage the companies they
invest in by taking so long to do it.  But companies do. So there
is a big opportunity here for a new kind of venture fund that invests
smaller amounts at lower valuations, but promises to either close
or say no very quickly.  If there were such a firm, I&apos;d recommend
it to startups in preference to any other, no matter how prestigious.
Startups live on speed and momentum.<br><br><b>21. Investors don&apos;t like to say no.</b><br><br>The reason funding deals take so long to close is mainly that
investors can&apos;t make up their minds.  VCs are not big companies;
they can do a deal in 24 hours if they need to.  But they usually
let the initial meetings stretch out over a couple weeks.  The
reason is the selection algorithm I mentioned earlier.  Most don&apos;t
try to predict whether a startup will win, but to notice quickly
that it already is winning.  They care what the market thinks of
you and what other VCs think of you, and they can&apos;t judge those
just from meeting you.<br><br>Because they&apos;re investing in things that (a) change fast and (b)
they don&apos;t understand, a lot of investors will reject you in a way
that can later be claimed not to have been a rejection.  Unless you
know this world, you may not even realize you&apos;ve been rejected.
Here&apos;s a VC saying no:
<blockquote>
  We&apos;re really excited about your project, and we want to keep in
  close touch as you develop it further.
</blockquote>
Translated into more straightforward language, this means: We&apos;re
not investing in you, but we may change our minds if it looks like
you&apos;re taking off.  Sometimes they&apos;re more candid and say explicitly
that they need to &quot;see some traction.&quot;  They&apos;ll invest in you if
you start to get lots of users.  But so would any VC.  So all they&apos;re
saying is that you&apos;re still at square 1.<br><br>Here&apos;s a test for deciding whether a VC&apos;s response was yes or no.
Look down at your hands.  Are you holding a termsheet?<br><br><b>22. You need investors.</b><br><br>Some founders say &quot;Who needs investors?&quot;  Empirically the answer
seems to be: everyone who wants to succeed.  Practically every
successful startup takes outside investment at some point.<br><br>Why? What the people who think they don&apos;t need investors forget is
that they will have competitors.  The question is not whether you
<i>need</i> outside investment, but whether it could help you at all.
If the answer is yes, and you don&apos;t take investment, then competitors
who do will have an advantage over you.  And in the startup world
a little advantage can expand into a lot.<br><br>Mike Moritz famously said that he invested in Yahoo because he
thought they had a few weeks&apos; lead over their competitors.  That
may not have mattered quite so much as he thought, because Google
came along three years later and kicked Yahoo&apos;s ass.  But there is
something in what he said.  Sometimes a small lead can grow into
the yes half of a binary choice.<br><br>Maybe as it gets cheaper to start a startup, it will start to be
possible to succeed in a competitive market without outside funding.  
There are certainly
costs to raising money.  But as of this writing the empirical
evidence says it&apos;s a net win.<br><br><b>23. Investors like it when you don&apos;t need them.</b><br><br>A lot of founders approach investors as if they needed their
permission to start a company&#x2014;as if it were like getting into
college.  But you don&apos;t need investors to start most companies;
they just make it easier.<br><br>And in fact, investors greatly prefer it if you don&apos;t need them.
What excites them, both consciously and unconsciously, is the sort
of startup that approaches them saying &quot;the train&apos;s leaving the
station; are you in or out?&quot; not the one saying &quot;please can we have
some money to start a company?&quot;<br><br>Most investors are &quot;bottoms&quot; in the sense that the startups they
like most are those that are rough with them.  When Google stuck
Kleiner and Sequoia with a $75 million premoney valuation, their
reaction was probably &quot;Ouch! That feels so good.&quot; And they were
right, weren&apos;t they?  That deal probably made them more than any
other they&apos;ve done.<br><br>The thing is, VCs are pretty good at reading people.  So don&apos;t try
to act tough with them unless you really are the next Google, or
they&apos;ll see through you in a second.  Instead of acting tough, what
most startups should do is simply always have a backup plan.  Always
have some alternative plan for getting started if any given investor
says no.  Having one is the best insurance against needing one.<br><br>So you shouldn&apos;t start a startup that&apos;s expensive to start, because
then you&apos;ll be at the mercy of investors.  If you ultimately want
to do something that will cost a lot, start by doing a cheaper
subset of it, and expand your ambitions when and if you raise more
money.<br><br>Apparently the most likely animals to be left alive after a nuclear
war are cockroaches, because they&apos;re so hard to kill.  That&apos;s what
you want to be as a startup, initially.  Instead of a beautiful
but fragile flower that needs to have its stem in a plastic tube
to support itself, better to be small, ugly, and indestructible.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]

A few VCs have an email address you can send your business

Several people have told us that the most valuable thing about 
<a href="http://startupschool.org">startup school</a>

generally look back on the mid twentieth century as a golden age.
In those days we had a large number of high-paying union manufacturing
jobs that boosted the median income.  I wouldn&apos;t quite call the
high-paying union job a myth, but I think people who dwell on it
are reading too much into it.<br><br>Oddly enough, it was working with startups that made me realize
where the high-paying union job came from.  In a rapidly growing
market, you don&apos;t worry too much about efficiency.  It&apos;s more
important to grow fast.  If there&apos;s some mundane problem getting
in your way, and there&apos;s a simple solution that&apos;s somewhat expensive,
just take it and get on with more important things.  EBay didn&apos;t
win by paying less for servers than their competitors.<br><br>Difficult though it may be to imagine now, manufacturing was a
growth industry in the mid twentieth century.  This was an era when
small firms making everything from cars to candy were getting
consolidated into a new kind of corporation with national reach and
huge economies of scale.  You had to grow fast or die.  Workers
were for these companies what servers are for an Internet startup.
A reliable supply was more important than low cost.<br><br>If you looked in the head of a 1950s auto executive, the attitude
must have been: sure, give &apos;em whatever they ask for, so long as
the new model isn&apos;t delayed.<br><br>In other words, those workers were not paid what their work was
worth.  Circumstances being what they were, companies would have
been stupid to insist on paying them so little.<br><br>If you want a less controversial example of this phenomenon, ask
anyone who worked as a consultant building web sites during the
Internet Bubble.  In the late nineties you could get paid huge sums
of money for building the most trivial things.  And yet does anyone
who was there have any expectation those days will ever return?  I
doubt it.  Surely everyone realizes that was just a temporary
aberration.<br><br>The era of labor unions seems to have been the same kind of aberration, 
just spread
over a longer period, and mixed together with a lot of ideology
that prevents people from viewing it with as cold an eye as they
would something like consulting during the Bubble.<br><br>Basically, unions were just Razorfish.<br><br>People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic union
organizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking now?
The best they can do is fall back on the default explanation of
people living in fallen civilizations.  Our ancestors were giants.
The workers of the early twentieth century must have had a moral
courage that&apos;s lacking today.<br><br>In fact there&apos;s a simpler explanation.  The early twentieth century
was just a fast-growing startup overpaying for infrastructure.  And
we in the present are not a fallen people, who have abandoned
whatever mysterious high-minded principles produced the high-paying
union job.  We simply live in a time when the fast-growing companies
overspend on different things.<br><br><br clear="all"></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="equity">The Equity Equation</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">July 2007<br><br>An investor wants to give you money for a certain percentage of
your startup.  Should you take it?  You&apos;re about to hire your first
employee.  How much stock should you give him?<br><br>These are some of the hardest questions founders face.  And yet
both have the same answer:<br><br>1/(1 - n)<br><br>Whenever you&apos;re trading stock in your company for anything, whether
it&apos;s money or an employee or a deal with another company, the test
for whether to do it is the same.  You should give up n% of your
company if what you trade it for improves your average outcome
enough that the (100 - n)% you have left is worth more than the
whole company was before.<br><br>For example, if an investor wants to buy half your company, how
much does that investment have to improve your average outcome for
you to break even?  Obviously it has to double: if you trade half
your company for something that more than doubles the company&apos;s
average outcome, you&apos;re net ahead.  You have half as big a share
of something worth more than twice as much.<br><br>In the general case, if n is the fraction of the company you&apos;re
giving up, the deal is a good one if it makes the company worth
more than 1/(1 - n).<br><br>For example, suppose Y Combinator offers to fund you in return for
6% of your company.  In this case, n is .06 and 1/(1 - n) is 1.064.
So you should take the deal if you believe we can improve your
average outcome by more than 6.4%.  If we improve your outcome by
10%, you&apos;re net ahead, because the remaining .94 you hold is worth
.94 x 1.1 = 1.034.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>One of the things the equity equation shows us is that, financially
at least, taking money from a top VC firm can be a really good deal.
Greg Mcadoo from Sequoia recently said at a YC dinner that when
Sequoia invests alone they like to take about 30% of a company.
1/.7 = 1.43, meaning that deal is worth taking if they can improve
your outcome by more than 43%.  For the average startup, that would
be an extraordinary bargain.  It would improve the average startup&apos;s
prospects by more than 43% just to be able to <i>say</i> they were funded
by Sequoia, even if they never actually got the money.<br><br>The reason Sequoia is such a good deal is that the percentage of
the company they take is artificially low.  They don&apos;t even try to
get market price for their investment; they limit their holdings
to leave the founders enough stock to feel the company is still
theirs.<br><br>The catch is that Sequoia gets about 6000 business plans a year and
funds about 20 of them, so the odds of getting this great deal are
1 in 300. The companies that make it through are not average startups.<br><br>Of course, there are other factors to consider in a VC deal.  It&apos;s
never just a straight trade of money for stock.  But if it were,
taking money from a top firm would generally be a bargain.<br><br>You can use the same formula when giving stock to employees, but
it works in the other direction.  If i is the average outcome for
the company with the addition of some new person, then they&apos;re worth
n such that i = 1/(1 - n).  Which means n = (i - 1)/i.<br><br>For example, suppose you&apos;re just two founders and you want to hire
an additional hacker who&apos;s so good you feel he&apos;ll increase the
average outcome of the whole company by 20%.  n = (1.2 - 1)/1.2 =
.167.  So you&apos;ll break even if you trade 16.7% of the company
for him.<br><br>That doesn&apos;t mean 16.7% is the right amount of stock to give him.
Stock is not the only cost of hiring someone: there&apos;s usually salary
and overhead as well.  And if the company merely breaks even on the
deal, there&apos;s no reason to do it.<br><br>I think to translate salary and overhead into stock you should
multiply the annual rate by about 1.5.  Most startups grow fast or
die; if you die you don&apos;t have to pay the guy, and if you grow fast
you&apos;ll be paying next year&apos;s salary out of next year&apos;s valuation,
which should be 3x this year&apos;s.  If your valuation grows 3x a year,
the total cost in stock of a new hire&apos;s salary and overhead is 1.5
years&apos; cost at the present valuation.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>How much of an additional margin should the company need as the
&quot;activation energy&quot; for the deal?  Since this is in effect the
company&apos;s profit on a hire, the market will determine that: if
you&apos;re a hot opportunity, you can charge more.<br><br>Let&apos;s run through an example.  Suppose the company wants to make a
&quot;profit&quot; of 50% on the new hire mentioned above.  So subtract a
third from 16.7% and we have 11.1% as his &quot;retail&quot; price.  Suppose
further that he&apos;s going to cost $60k a year in salary and overhead,
x 1.5 = $90k total.  If the company&apos;s valuation is $2 million, $90k
is 4.5%.  11.1% - 4.5% = an offer of 6.6%.<br><br>Incidentally, notice how important it is for early employees to
take little salary.  It comes right out of stock that could otherwise
be given to them.<br><br>Obviously there is a great deal of play in these numbers.  I&apos;m not
claiming that stock grants can now be reduced to a formula.  Ultimately
you always have to guess.  But at least know what you&apos;re guessing.
If you choose a number based on your gut feel, or a table of typical
grant sizes supplied by a VC firm, understand what those are estimates
of.<br><br>And more generally, when you make any decision involving equity,
run it through 1/(1 - n) to see if it makes sense.  You should
always feel richer after trading equity.  If the trade didn&apos;t
increase the value of your remaining shares enough to put you net
ahead, you wouldn&apos;t have (or shouldn&apos;t have) done it.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] This is why we

Most people in America do.  In fact, the
poorer people are, the more stuff they seem to have.  Hardly anyone
is so poor that they can&apos;t afford a front yard full of old cars.<br><br>It wasn&apos;t always this way.  Stuff used to be rare and valuable.
You can still see evidence of that if you look for it.  For example,
in my house in Cambridge, which was built in 1876, the bedrooms
don&apos;t have closets.  In those days people&apos;s stuff fit in a chest
of drawers.  Even as recently as a few decades ago there was a lot
less stuff.  When I look back at photos from the 1970s, I&apos;m surprised
how empty houses look.  As a kid I had what I thought was a huge
fleet of toy cars, but they&apos;d be dwarfed by the number of toys my
nephews have.  All together my Matchboxes and Corgis took up about
a third of the surface of my bed.  In my nephews&apos; rooms the bed is
the only clear space.<br><br>Stuff has gotten a lot cheaper, but our attitudes toward it haven&apos;t
changed correspondingly.  We overvalue stuff.<br><br>That was a big problem
for me when I had no money.  I felt poor, and stuff seemed valuable,
so almost instinctively I accumulated it.  Friends would leave
something behind when they moved, or I&apos;d see something as I was
walking down the street on trash night (beware of anything you find
yourself describing as &quot;perfectly good&quot;), or I&apos;d find something in
almost new condition for a tenth its retail price at a garage sale.
And pow, more stuff.<br><br>In fact these free or nearly free things weren&apos;t bargains, because
they were worth even less than they cost.  Most of the stuff I
accumulated was worthless, because I didn&apos;t need it.<br><br>What I didn&apos;t understand was that the value of some new acquisition
wasn&apos;t the difference between its retail price and what I paid for
it.  It was the value I derived from it.  Stuff is an extremely
illiquid asset.  Unless you have some plan for selling that valuable
thing you got so cheaply, what difference does it make what it&apos;s
&quot;worth?&quot;  The only way you&apos;re ever going to extract any value from
it is to use it.  And if you don&apos;t have any immediate use for it,
you probably never will.<br><br>Companies that sell stuff have spent huge sums training us to think
stuff is still valuable.  But it would be closer to the truth to
treat stuff as worthless.<br><br>In fact, worse than worthless, because once you&apos;ve accumulated a
certain amount of stuff, it starts to own you rather than the other
way around.  I know of one couple who couldn&apos;t retire to the town
they preferred because they couldn&apos;t afford a place there big enough
for all their stuff.  Their house isn&apos;t theirs; it&apos;s their stuff&apos;s.<br><br>And unless you&apos;re extremely organized, a house full of stuff can
be very depressing. A cluttered room saps one&apos;s spirits.  One
reason, obviously, is that there&apos;s less room for people in a room
full of stuff.  But there&apos;s more going on than that.  I think humans
constantly scan their environment to build a mental model of what&apos;s
around them.  And the harder a scene is to parse, the less energy
you have left for conscious thoughts.  A cluttered room is literally
exhausting.<br><br>(This could explain why clutter doesn&apos;t seem to bother kids as much
as adults. Kids are less perceptive.  They build a coarser model
of their surroundings, and this consumes less energy.)<br><br>I first realized the worthlessness of stuff when I lived in Italy
for a year.  All I took with me was one large backpack of stuff.
The rest of my stuff I left in my landlady&apos;s attic back in the US.
And you know what?  All I missed were some of the books.  By the
end of the year I couldn&apos;t even remember what else I had stored in
that attic.<br><br>And yet when I got back I didn&apos;t discard so much as a box of it.
Throw away a perfectly good rotary telephone?  I might need that
one day.<br><br>The really painful thing to recall is not just that I accumulated
all this useless stuff, but that I often spent money I desperately
needed on stuff that I didn&apos;t.<br><br>Why would I do that?  Because the people whose job is to sell you
stuff are really, really good at it.  The average 25 year old is
no match for companies that have spent years figuring out how to
get you to spend money on stuff.  They make the experience of buying
stuff so pleasant that &quot;shopping&quot; becomes a leisure activity.<br><br>How do you protect yourself from these people?  It can&apos;t be easy.
I&apos;m a fairly skeptical person, and their tricks worked on me well
into my thirties.  But one thing that might work is to ask yourself,
before buying something, &quot;is this going to make my life noticeably
better?&quot;<br><br>A friend of mine cured herself of a clothes buying habit by asking
herself before she bought anything &quot;Am I going to wear this all the
time?&quot;  If she couldn&apos;t convince herself that something she was
thinking of buying would become one of those few things she wore
all the time, she wouldn&apos;t buy it.  I think that would work for any
kind of purchase.  Before you buy anything, ask yourself: will this
be something I use constantly?  Or is it just something nice?  Or
worse still, a mere bargain?<br><br>The worst stuff in this respect may be stuff you don&apos;t use much
because it&apos;s too good.  Nothing owns you like fragile stuff.  For
example, the &quot;good china&quot; so many households have, and whose defining
quality is not so much that it&apos;s fun to use, but that one must be
especially careful not to break it.<br><br>Another way to resist acquiring stuff is to think of the overall
cost of owning it.  The purchase price is just the beginning.  You&apos;re
going to have to <i>think</i> about that thing for years&#x2014;perhaps for
the rest of your life.  Every thing you own takes energy away from
you.  Some give more than they take.  Those are the only things
worth having.<br><br>I&apos;ve now stopped accumulating stuff.  Except books&#x2014;but books are
different.  Books are more like a fluid than individual objects.
It&apos;s not especially inconvenient to own several thousand books,
whereas if you owned several thousand random possessions you&apos;d be
a local celebrity.  But except for books, I now actively avoid
stuff.  If I want to spend money on some kind of treat, I&apos;ll take
<xa href="http://acadiaairtours.com/flights.html">services over 
<xa href="http://www.collectiblestoday.com/ct/product/prdid-1400328001.jsp" rel="nofollow">goods any day.<br><br>I&apos;m not claiming this is because I&apos;ve achieved some kind of zenlike
detachment from material things.  I&apos;m talking about something more
mundane.  A historical change has taken place, and I&apos;ve now realized
it.  Stuff used to be valuable, and now it&apos;s not.<br><br>In industrialized countries the same thing happened with food in
the middle of the twentieth century.  As food got cheaper (or we
got richer; they&apos;re indistinguishable), eating too much started to
be a bigger danger than eating too little.   We&apos;ve now reached that
point with stuff.  For most people, rich or poor, stuff has become
a burden.<br><br>The good news is, if you&apos;re carrying a burden without knowing it,
your life could be better than you realize.  Imagine walking around
for years with five pound ankle weights, then suddenly having them
removed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

id="head">Holding a Program in One&apos;s Head</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">August 2007<br><br>A good programmer working intensively on his own code can hold it
in his mind the way a mathematician holds a problem he&apos;s working
on.  Mathematicians don&apos;t answer questions by working them out on
paper the way schoolchildren are taught to.  They do more in their
heads: they try to understand a problem space well enough that they
can walk around it the way you can walk around the memory of the
house you grew up in.  At its best programming is the same.  You
hold the whole program in your head, and you can manipulate it at
will.<br><br>That&apos;s particularly valuable at the start of a project, because
initially the most important thing is to be able to change what
you&apos;re doing.  Not just to solve the problem in a different way,
but to change the problem you&apos;re solving.<br><br>Your code is your understanding of the problem you&apos;re exploring.
So it&apos;s only when you have your code in your head that you really
understand the problem.<br><br>It&apos;s not easy to get a program into your head.  If you leave a
project for a few months, it can take days to really understand it
again when you return to it.  Even when you&apos;re actively working on
a program it can take half an hour to load into your head when you
start work each day.  And that&apos;s in the best case.  Ordinary
programmers working in typical office conditions never enter this
mode.  Or to put it more dramatically, ordinary programmers working
in typical office conditions never really understand the problems
they&apos;re solving.<br><br>Even the best programmers don&apos;t always have the whole program they&apos;re
working on loaded into their heads.   But there are things you can
do to help:<br><br><ol>
<li> <b>Avoid distractions.</b>  Distractions are bad for many types of work,
   but especially bad for programming, because programmers tend to
   operate at the limit of the detail they can handle.<br><br>The danger of a distraction depends not on how long it is, but
   on how much it scrambles your brain.  A programmer can leave the
   office and go and get a sandwich without losing the code in his
   head.  But the wrong kind of interruption can wipe your brain
   in 30 seconds.<br><br>Oddly enough, scheduled distractions may be worse than unscheduled
   ones.  If you know you have a meeting in an hour, you don&apos;t even
   start working on something hard.<br><br></li><li> <b>Work in long stretches.</b>  Since there&apos;s a fixed cost each time
   you start working on a program, it&apos;s more efficient to work in
   a few long sessions than many short ones.  There will of course
   come a point where you get stupid because you&apos;re tired.  This
   varies from person to person.  I&apos;ve heard of people hacking for
   36 hours straight, but the most I&apos;ve ever been able to manage
   is about 18, and I work best in chunks of no more than 12.<br><br>The optimum is not the limit you can physically endure.  There&apos;s
   an advantage as well as a cost of breaking up a project.  Sometimes
   when you return to a problem after a rest, you find your unconscious
   mind has left an answer waiting for you.<br><br></li><li> <b>Use succinct languages.</b>  More 
   <a href="power.html">powerful</a> programming languages
   make programs shorter. And programmers seem to think of programs
   at least partially in the language they&apos;re using to write them.
   The more succinct the language, the shorter the program, and the
   easier it is to load and keep in your head.<br><br>You can magnify the effect of a powerful language by using a
   style called bottom-up programming, where you write programs in
   multiple layers, the lower ones acting as programming languages
   for those above.  If you do this right, you only have to keep
   the topmost layer in your head.<br><br></li><li> <b>Keep rewriting your program.</b>  Rewriting a program often yields
   a cleaner design.  But it would have advantages even if it didn&apos;t:
   you have to understand a program completely to rewrite it, so
   there is no better way to get one loaded into your head.<br><br></li><li> <b>Write rereadable code.</b>  All programmers know it&apos;s good to write
   readable code.  But you yourself are the most important reader.
   Especially in the beginning; a prototype is a conversation with
   yourself.  And when writing for yourself you have different
   priorities.  If you&apos;re writing for other people, you may not
   want to make code too dense.  Some parts of a program may be
   easiest to read if you spread things out, like an introductory 
   textbook.  Whereas if you&apos;re writing code to make it easy to reload 
   into your head, it may be best to go for brevity.<br><br></li><li> <b>Work in small groups.</b>  When you manipulate a program in your
   head, your vision tends to stop at the edge of the code you own.
   Other parts you don&apos;t understand as well, and more importantly,
   can&apos;t take liberties with.  So the smaller the number of
   programmers, the more completely a project can mutate.  If there&apos;s
   just one programmer, as there often is at first, you can do
   all-encompassing redesigns.<br><br></li><li> <b>Don&apos;t have multiple people editing the same piece of code.</b>  You
   never understand other people&apos;s code as well as your own.  No
   matter how thoroughly you&apos;ve read it, you&apos;ve only read it, not
   written it.  So if a piece of code is written by multiple authors,
   none of them understand it as well as a single author would.<br><br>And of course you can&apos;t safely redesign something other people
   are working on.  It&apos;s not just that you&apos;d have to ask permission.
   You don&apos;t even let yourself think of such things.  Redesigning
   code with several authors is like changing laws; redesigning
   code you alone control is like seeing the other interpretation
   of an ambiguous image.<br><br>If you want to put several people to work on a project, divide
   it into components and give each to one person.<br><br></li><li> <b>Start small.</b>  A program gets easier to hold in your head as you
   become familiar with it.  You can start to treat parts as black
   boxes once you feel confident you&apos;ve fully explored them.  But
   when you first start working on a project, you&apos;re forced to see
   everything.  If you start with too big a problem, you may never
   quite be able to encompass it.  So if you need to write a big,
   complex program, the best way to begin may not be to write a
   spec for it, but to write a prototype that solves a subset of
   the problem.  Whatever the advantages of planning, they&apos;re often
   outweighed by the advantages of being able to keep a program in
   your head.
</li></ol>
It&apos;s striking how often programmers manage to hit all eight points
by accident.  Someone has an idea for a new project, but because
it&apos;s not officially sanctioned, he has to do it in off hours&#x2014;which
turn out to be more productive because there are no distractions.
Driven by his enthusiasm for the new project he works on it for
many hours at a stretch.  Because it&apos;s initially just an
experiment, instead of a &quot;production&quot; language he uses a mere
&quot;scripting&quot; language&#x2014;which is in fact far more powerful.  He
completely rewrites the program several times; that wouldn&apos;t be
justifiable for an official project, but this is a labor of love
and he wants it to be perfect.  And since no one is going to see
it except him, he omits any comments except the note-to-self variety.
He works in a small group perforce, because he either hasn&apos;t told
anyone else about the idea yet, or it seems so unpromising that no
one else is allowed to work on it.  Even if there is a group, they
couldn&apos;t have multiple people editing the same code, because it
changes too fast for that to be possible.  And the project starts
small because the idea <i>is</i> small at first; he just has some cool
hack he wants to try out.<br><br>Even more striking are the number of officially sanctioned projects
that manage to do <i>all eight things wrong</i>.  In fact, if you look at
the way software gets written in most organizations, it&apos;s almost
as if they were deliberately trying to do things wrong. In a sense,
they are.  One of the defining qualities of organizations since
there have been such a thing is to treat individuals as interchangeable
parts.  This works well for more parallelizable tasks, like fighting
wars.  For most of history a well-drilled army of professional
soldiers could be counted on to beat an army of individual warriors,
no matter how valorous.  But having ideas is not very parallelizable.
And that&apos;s what programs are: ideas.<br><br>It&apos;s not merely true that organizations dislike the idea of depending
on individual genius, it&apos;s a tautology.  It&apos;s part of the definition
of an organization not to.  Of our current concept of an organization,
at least.<br><br>Maybe we could define a new kind of organization that combined the
efforts of individuals without requiring them to be interchangeable.
Arguably a market is such a form of organization, though it may be
more accurate to describe a market as a degenerate case&#x2014;as what
you get by default when organization isn&apos;t possible.<br><br>Probably the best we&apos;ll do is some kind of hack, like making the
programming parts of an organization work differently from the rest.
Perhaps the optimal solution is for big companies not even to try
to develop ideas in house, but simply to 
<a href="hiring.html">buy</a> them.  But regardless
of what the solution turns out to be, the first step is to realize
there&apos;s a problem.  There is a contradiction in the very phrase
&quot;software company.&quot;   The two words are pulling in opposite directions.
Any good programmer in a large organization is going to be at odds
with it, because organizations are designed to prevent what
programmers strive for.<br><br><xa href="gh.html">Good programmers manage to get a lot done anyway.  
But often it
requires practically an act of rebellion against the organizations
that employ them.  Perhaps it will help if more people understand that the way
programmers behave is driven by the demands of the work they do.
It&apos;s not because they&apos;re irresponsible that they work in long binges
during which they blow off all other obligations, plunge straight into
programming instead of writing specs first, and rewrite code that
already works.  It&apos;s not because they&apos;re unfriendly that they prefer
to work alone, or growl at people who pop their head in the door
to say hello.  This apparently random collection of annoying habits
has a single explanation: the power of holding a program in one&apos;s
head.<br><br>Whether or not understanding this can help large organizations, it
can certainly help their competitors.  The weakest point in big
companies is that they don&apos;t let individual programmers do great
work.  So if you&apos;re a little startup, this is the place to attack
them.  Take on the kind of problems that have to be solved in one
big brain.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>
August 2007<br><br><i>(This is a talk I gave at the last 
Y Combinator dinner of the summer. 
Usually we don&apos;t have a speaker at the last dinner; it&apos;s more of
a party.  But it seemed worth spoiling the atmosphere if I could
save some of the startups from
preventable deaths.  So at the last minute I cooked up this rather
grim talk.  I didn&apos;t mean this as an essay; I wrote it down
because I only had two hours before dinner and think fastest while
writing.)
</i><br><br>A couple days ago I told a reporter that we expected about a third
of the companies we funded to succeed.  Actually I was being
conservative.  I&apos;m hoping it might be as much as a half.  Wouldn&apos;t
it be amazing if we could achieve a 50% success rate?<br><br>Another way of saying that is that half of you are going to die.  Phrased
that way, it doesn&apos;t sound good at all.  In fact, it&apos;s kind of weird
when you think about it, because our definition of success is that
the founders get rich.  If half the startups we fund succeed, then
half of you are going to get rich and the other half are going to
get nothing.<br><br>If you can just avoid dying, you get rich.  That sounds like a joke,
but it&apos;s actually a pretty good description of what happens in a
typical startup.  It certainly describes what happened in Viaweb.
We avoided dying till we got rich.<br><br>It was really close, too.  When we were visiting Yahoo to talk about
being acquired, we had to interrupt everything and borrow one of
their conference rooms to talk down an investor who was about to
back out of a new funding round we needed to stay alive.   So even
in the middle of getting rich we were fighting off the grim reaper.<br><br>You may have heard that quote about luck consisting of opportunity
meeting preparation.  You&apos;ve now done the preparation.  The work
you&apos;ve done so far has, in effect, put you in a position to get
lucky: you can now get rich by not letting your company die.  That&apos;s
more than most people have.  So let&apos;s talk about how not to die.<br><br>We&apos;ve done this five times now, and we&apos;ve seen a bunch of startups
die.  About 10 of them so far.  We don&apos;t know exactly what happens
when they die, because they generally don&apos;t die loudly and heroically.
Mostly they crawl off somewhere and die.<br><br>For us the main indication of impending doom is when we don&apos;t hear
from you.  When we haven&apos;t heard from, or about, a startup for a
couple months, that&apos;s a bad sign.  If we send them an email asking
what&apos;s up, and they don&apos;t reply, that&apos;s a really bad sign.  So far
that is a 100% accurate predictor of death.<br><br>Whereas if a startup regularly does new deals and releases and
either sends us mail or shows up at YC events, they&apos;re probably
going to live.<br><br>I realize this will sound naive, but maybe the linkage works in
both directions.  Maybe if you can arrange that we keep hearing
from you, you won&apos;t die.<br><br>That may not be so naive as it sounds.  You&apos;ve probably noticed
that having dinners every Tuesday with us and the other founders
causes you to get more done than you would otherwise, because every
dinner is a mini Demo Day.  Every dinner is a kind of a deadline.
So the mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us will
push you to make things happen, because otherwise you&apos;ll be embarrassed
to tell us that you haven&apos;t done anything new since the last time
we talked.<br><br>If this works, it would be an amazing hack.  It would be pretty
cool if merely by staying in regular contact with us you could get
rich.  It sounds crazy, but there&apos;s a good chance that would work.<br><br>A variant is to stay in touch with other YC-funded startups.  There
is now a whole neighborhood of them in San Francisco.  If you move
there, the peer pressure that made you work harder all summer will
continue to operate.<br><br>When startups die, the official cause of death is always either
running out of money or a critical founder bailing.  Often the two
occur simultaneously.  But I think the underlying cause is usually
that they&apos;ve become demoralized.  You rarely hear of a startup
that&apos;s working around the clock doing deals and pumping out new
features, and dies because they can&apos;t pay their bills and their ISP
unplugs their server.<br><br>Startups rarely die in mid keystroke.  So keep typing!<br><br>If so many startups get demoralized and fail when merely by hanging
on they could get rich, you have to assume that running a startup
can be demoralizing.  That is certainly true.  I&apos;ve been there, and
that&apos;s why I&apos;ve never done another startup.  The low points in a
startup are just unbelievably low.  I bet even Google had moments
where things seemed hopeless.<br><br>Knowing that should help.  If you know it&apos;s going to feel terrible
sometimes, then when it feels terrible you won&apos;t think &quot;ouch, this
feels terrible, I give up.&quot;  It feels that way for everyone.  And
if you just hang on, things will probably get better.  The metaphor
people use to describe the way a startup feels is at least a roller
coaster and not drowning.  You don&apos;t just sink and sink; there are
ups after the downs.<br><br>Another feeling that seems alarming but is in fact normal in a
startup is the feeling that what you&apos;re doing isn&apos;t working.  The
reason you can expect to feel this is that what you do probably
won&apos;t work.  Startups almost never get it right the first time.
Much more commonly you launch something, and no one cares.  Don&apos;t
assume when this happens that you&apos;ve failed.  That&apos;s normal for
startups.  But don&apos;t sit around doing nothing.  Iterate.<br><br>I like Paul Buchheit&apos;s suggestion of trying to make something that
at least someone really loves.  As long as you&apos;ve made something
that a few users are ecstatic about, you&apos;re on the right track.  It
will be good for your morale to have even a handful of users who
really love you, and startups run on morale.  But also it
will tell you what to focus on.  What is it about you that they
love?  Can you do more of that?  Where can you find more people who
love that sort of thing?  As long as you have some core of users
who love you, all you have to do is expand it.  It may take a while,
but as long as you keep plugging away, you&apos;ll win in the end.  Both
Blogger and Delicious did that.  Both took years to succeed.  But
both began with a core of fanatically devoted users, and all Evan
and Joshua had to do was grow that core incrementally.  
<a href="http://wufoo.com">Wufoo</a> is
on the same trajectory now.<br><br>So when you release something and it seems like no one cares, look
more closely.  Are there zero users who really love you, or is there
at least some little group that does?  It&apos;s quite possible there
will be zero.  In that case, tweak your product and try again.
Every one of you is working on a space that contains at least one
winning permutation somewhere in it.  If you just keep trying,
you&apos;ll find it.<br><br>Let me mention some things not to do.  The number one thing not to
do is other things.  If you find yourself saying a sentence that
ends with &quot;but we&apos;re going to keep working on the startup,&quot; you are
in big trouble.  Bob&apos;s going to grad school, but we&apos;re going to
keep working on the startup.  We&apos;re moving back to Minnesota, but
we&apos;re going to keep working on the startup.  We&apos;re taking on some
consulting projects, but we&apos;re going to keep working on the startup.
You may as well just translate these to &quot;we&apos;re giving up on the
startup, but we&apos;re not willing to admit that to ourselves,&quot; because
that&apos;s what it means most of the time.  A startup is so hard that
working on it can&apos;t be preceded by &quot;but.&quot;<br><br>In particular, don&apos;t go to graduate school, and don&apos;t start other
projects.  Distraction is fatal to startups.  Going to (or back to)
school is a huge predictor of death because in addition to the
distraction it gives you something to say you&apos;re doing.  If you&apos;re
only doing a startup, then if the startup fails, you fail.  If
you&apos;re in grad school and your startup fails, you can say later &quot;Oh
yeah, we had this startup on the side when I was in grad school,
but it didn&apos;t go anywhere.&quot;<br><br>You can&apos;t use euphemisms like &quot;didn&apos;t go anywhere&quot; for something
that&apos;s your only occupation.  People won&apos;t let you.<br><br>One of the most interesting things we&apos;ve discovered from working
on Y Combinator is that founders are more motivated by the fear of
looking bad than by the hope of getting millions of dollars.   So
if you want to get millions of dollars, put yourself in a position
where failure will be public and humiliating.<br><br>When we first met the founders of 
<a href="http://octopart.com">Octopart</a>, they seemed very smart,
but not a great bet to succeed, because they didn&apos;t seem especially
committed.  One of the two founders was still in grad school.  It
was the usual story: he&apos;d drop out if it looked like the startup
was taking off.  Since then he has not only dropped out of grad
school, but appeared full length in 
<a href="http://docs.octopart.com/newsweek_octopart_small.jpg">Newsweek</a> 
with the word &quot;Billionaire&quot;
printed across his chest.  He just cannot fail now.  Everyone he
knows has seen that picture.  Girls who dissed him in high school
have seen it.  His mom probably has it on the fridge.  It would be
unthinkably humiliating to fail now.  At this point he is committed
to fight to the death.<br><br>I wish every startup we funded could appear in a Newsweek article
describing them as the next generation of billionaires, because
then none of them would be able to give up.  The success rate would
be 90%.  I&apos;m not kidding.<br><br>When we first knew the Octoparts they were lighthearted, cheery
guys.  Now when we talk to them they seem grimly determined.  The
electronic parts distributors are trying to squash them to keep
their monopoly pricing.  (If it strikes you as odd that people still
order electronic parts out of thick paper catalogs in 2007, there&apos;s
a reason for that.  The distributors want to prevent the transparency
that comes from having prices online.)  I feel kind of bad that
we&apos;ve transformed these guys from lighthearted to grimly determined.
But that comes with the territory.  If a startup succeeds, you get
millions of dollars, and you don&apos;t get that kind of money just by
asking for it.  You have to assume it takes some amount of pain.<br><br>And however tough things get for the Octoparts, I predict they&apos;ll
succeed.  They may have to morph themselves into something totally
different, but they won&apos;t just crawl off and die.  They&apos;re smart;
they&apos;re working in a promising field; and they just cannot give up.<br><br>All of you guys already have the first two.  You&apos;re all smart and
working on promising ideas.  Whether you end up among the living
or the dead comes down to the third ingredient, not giving up.<br><br>So I&apos;ll tell you now: bad shit is coming.  It always is in a startup.
The odds of getting from launch to liquidity without some kind of
disaster happening are one in a thousand.  So don&apos;t get demoralized.
When the disaster strikes, just say to yourself, ok, this was what
Paul was talking about.  What did he say to do?  Oh, yeah.  Don&apos;t
give up.<br><br></p></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.aoky.net/articles/paul_graham/die.htm">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="6"><center><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2271_5194" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></td><td width="8"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="196"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://academy.hsoub.com/entrepreneurship/general/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%91%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%91%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%A6%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%9Fhow-not-to-die-r62/">Arabic Translation</a><br><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="colleges">News from the Front</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">September 2007<br><br>A few weeks ago I had a thought so heretical that it really surprised
me. It may not matter all that much where you go to college.<br><br>For me, as for a lot of middle class kids, getting into a good
college was more or less the meaning of life when I was growing up.
What was I?  A student.  To do that well meant to get good grades.
Why did one have to get good grades?  To get into a good college.
And why did one want to do that?  There seemed to be several reasons:
you&apos;d learn more, get better jobs, make more money.  But it didn&apos;t
matter exactly what the benefits would be.  College was a bottleneck
through which all your future prospects passed; everything would
be better if you went to a better college.<br><br>A few weeks ago I realized that somewhere along the line I had
stopped believing that.<br><br>What first set me thinking about this was the new trend of worrying
obsessively about what 
<a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/urban/education/features/15141/">kindergarten</a>
your kids go to.  It seemed to
me this couldn&apos;t possibly matter.  Either it won&apos;t help your kid
get into Harvard, or if it does, getting into Harvard won&apos;t mean
much anymore.  And then I thought: how much does it mean even now?<br><br>It turns out I have a lot of data about that.  My three partners
and I run a seed stage investment firm called 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>.  We
invest when the company is just a couple guys and an idea.  The
idea doesn&apos;t matter much; it will change anyway.  Most of our
decision is based on the founders.  The average founder is three
years out of college.  Many have just graduated; a few are still
in school.  So we&apos;re in much the same position as a graduate program,
or a company hiring people right out of college.  Except our choices
are immediately and visibly tested.  There are two possible outcomes
for a startup: success or failure&#x2014;and usually you know within a
year which it will be.<br><br>The test applied to a startup is among the purest of real world
tests.  A startup succeeds or fails depending almost entirely on
the efforts of the founders.  Success is decided by the market: you
only succeed if users like what you&apos;ve built.  And users don&apos;t care
where you went to college.<br><br>As well as having precisely measurable results, we have a lot of
them.  Instead of doing a small number of large deals like a
traditional venture capital fund, we do a large number of small
ones.  We currently fund about 40 companies a year, selected from
about 900 applications representing a total of about 2000 people. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Between the volume of people we judge and the rapid, unequivocal
test that&apos;s applied to our choices, Y Combinator has been an
unprecedented opportunity for learning how to pick winners.  One
of the most surprising things we&apos;ve learned is how little it matters
where people went to college.<br><br>I thought I&apos;d already been cured of caring about that.  There&apos;s
nothing like going to grad school at Harvard to cure you of any
illusions you might have about the average Harvard undergrad.  And
yet Y Combinator showed us we were still overestimating people who&apos;d
been to elite colleges.  We&apos;d interview people from MIT or Harvard
or Stanford and sometimes find ourselves thinking: they <i>must</i> be
smarter than they seem.  It took us a few iterations to learn to
trust our senses.<br><br>Practically everyone thinks that someone who went to MIT or Harvard
or Stanford must be smart.  Even people who hate you for it believe
it.<br><br>But when you think about what it means to have gone to an elite
college, how could this be true?   We&apos;re talking about a decision
made by admissions officers&#x2014;basically, HR people&#x2014;based on a
cursory examination of a huge pile of depressingly similar applications
submitted by seventeen year olds.  And what do they have to go on?
An easily gamed standardized test; a short essay telling you what
the kid thinks you want to hear; an interview with a random alum;
a high school record that&apos;s largely an index of obedience.  Who
would rely on such a test?<br><br>And yet a lot of companies do.  A lot of companies are very much
influenced by where applicants went to college.  How could they be?
I think I know the answer to that.<br><br>There used to be a saying in the corporate world: &quot;No one ever got
fired for buying IBM.&quot;  You no longer hear this about IBM specifically,
but the idea is very much alive; there is a whole category of
&quot;enterprise&quot; software companies that exist to take advantage of it.
People buying technology for large organizations don&apos;t care if they
pay a fortune for mediocre software.  It&apos;s not their money.  They
just want to buy from a supplier who seems safe&#x2014;a company with
an established name, confident salesmen, impressive offices, and
software that conforms to all the current fashions.  Not necessarily
a company that will deliver so much as one that, if they do let you
down, will still seem to have been a prudent choice.  So companies
have evolved to fill that niche.<br><br>A recruiter at a big company is in much the same position as someone
buying technology for one.  If someone went to Stanford and is not
obviously insane, they&apos;re probably a safe bet.  And a safe bet is
enough.  No one ever measures recruiters by the later performance
of people they turn down. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>I&apos;m not saying, of course, that elite colleges have evolved to prey
upon the weaknesses of large organizations the way enterprise
software companies have.  But they work as if they had.  In addition
to the power of the brand name, graduates of elite colleges have
two critical qualities that plug right into the way large organizations
work.  They&apos;re good at doing what they&apos;re asked, since that&apos;s what
it takes to please the adults who judge you at seventeen.  And
having been to an elite college makes them more confident.<br><br>Back in the days when people might spend their whole career at one
big company, these qualities must have been very valuable.  Graduates
of elite colleges would have been capable, yet amenable to authority.
And since individual performance is so hard to measure in large
organizations, their own confidence would have been the starting
point for their reputation.<br><br>Things are very different in the new world of startups.  We couldn&apos;t
save someone from the market&apos;s judgement even if we wanted to.  And
being charming and confident counts for nothing with users.  All
users care about is whether you make something they like.  If you
don&apos;t, you&apos;re dead.<br><br>Knowing that test is coming makes us work a lot harder to get the
right answers than anyone would if they were merely hiring people.
We can&apos;t afford to have any illusions about the predictors of
success.  And what we&apos;ve found is that the variation between schools
is so much smaller than the variation between individuals that it&apos;s
negligible by comparison.  We can learn more about someone in the
first minute of talking to them than by knowing where they went to
school.<br><br>It seems obvious when you put it that way.  Look at the individual,
not where they went to college.  But that&apos;s a weaker statement than
the idea I began with, that it doesn&apos;t matter much where a given
individual goes to college.  Don&apos;t you learn things at the best
schools that you wouldn&apos;t learn at lesser places?<br><br>Apparently not.  Obviously you can&apos;t prove this in the case of a
single individual, but you can tell from aggregate evidence: you
can&apos;t, without asking them, distinguish people who went to one
school from those who went to another three times as far down the
<i>US News</i> list. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
Try it and see.<br><br>How can this be?  Because how much you learn in college depends a
lot more on you than the college.  A determined party animal can
get through the best school without learning anything.  And someone
with a real thirst for knowledge will be able to find a few smart
people to learn from at a school that isn&apos;t prestigious at all.<br><br>
The other students are the biggest advantage of going to an elite
college; you learn more from them than the professors.  But
you should be able to reproduce this at most colleges if you make
a conscious effort to find smart friends.  At
most colleges you can find at least a handful of other smart students,
and most people have only a handful of close friends in college
anyway. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
The odds of finding smart professors are even better.
The curve for faculty is a lot flatter than for students, especially
in math and the hard sciences; you have to go pretty far down the
list of colleges before you stop finding smart professors in the
math department.<br><br>So it&apos;s not surprising that we&apos;ve found the relative prestige of
different colleges useless in judging individuals.  There&apos;s a lot
of randomness in how colleges select people, and what they learn
there depends much more on them than the college.  Between these
two sources of variation, the college someone went to doesn&apos;t mean
a lot.  It is to some degree a predictor of ability, but so weak
that we regard it mainly as a source of error and try consciously
to ignore it.<br><br>I doubt what we&apos;ve discovered is an anomaly specific to startups.
Probably people have always overestimated the importance of where
one goes to college.  We&apos;re just finally able to measure it.<br><br>The unfortunate thing is not just that people are judged by such a
superficial test, but that so many judge themselves by it.  A lot
of people, probably the majority of people in America, have
some amount of insecurity about where, or whether, they went to
college.  The tragedy of the situation is that by far the greatest
liability of not having gone to the college you&apos;d have liked is
your own feeling that you&apos;re thereby lacking something.  Colleges
are a bit like exclusive clubs in this respect.  There is only one
real advantage to being a member of most exclusive clubs: you know
you wouldn&apos;t be missing much if you weren&apos;t.  When you&apos;re excluded,
you can only imagine the advantages of being an insider.  But
invariably they&apos;re larger in your imagination than in real life.<br><br>So it is with colleges.  Colleges differ, but they&apos;re nothing like
the stamp of destiny so many imagine them to be.  People aren&apos;t
what some admissions officer decides about them at seventeen.
They&apos;re what they make themselves.<br><br>Indeed, the great advantage of not caring where people went to
college is not just that you can stop judging them (and yourself)
by superficial measures, but that you can focus instead on what
really matters.  What matters is what you make of yourself.  
I think that&apos;s what we
should tell kids.  Their job isn&apos;t to get good grades so they can
get into a good college, but to learn and do.  And not just because
that&apos;s more rewarding than worldly success.  That will increasingly
<i>be</i> the route to worldly success.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] 
Is what we measure worth measuring?  I think so.  You can get
rich simply by being energetic and unscrupulous, but getting rich
from a technology startup takes some amount of brains.   It is just
the kind of work the upper middle class values; it has about the
same intellectual component as being a doctor.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>] 
Actually, someone did, once.  Mitch Kapor&apos;s wife Freada was
in charge of HR at Lotus in the early years.  (As he is at pains
to point out, they did not become romantically involved till
afterward.)  At one point they worried Lotus was losing its startup
edge and turning into a big company.  So as an experiment she sent
their recruiters the resumes of the first 40 employees, with
identifying details changed.  These were the people who had made
Lotus into the star it was.  Not one got an interview.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>] 
The <i>US News</i> list?  Surely no one trusts that.  Even if the
statistics they consider are useful, how do they decide on the
relative weights?  The reason the <i>US News</i> list is meaningful is
precisely because they are so intellectually dishonest in that
respect.  There is no external source they can use to calibrate the
weighting of the statistics they use; if there were, we could just
use that instead.  What they must do is adjust the weights till the
top schools are the usual suspects in about the right order.  So
in effect what the <i>US News</i> list tells us is what the editors think
the top schools are, which is probably not far from the conventional
wisdom on the matter.  The amusing thing is, because some schools
work hard to game the system, the editors will have to keep tweaking
their algorithm to get the rankings they want.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>] 
Possible doesn&apos;t mean easy, of course.  A smart student at a party school
will inevitably be something of an outcast, just as he or
she would be in most <a href="nerds.html">high schools</a>.<br><br>

I had several motives, some more honorable than others.  One of the
less honorable was to shock people.  College was regarded as job
training where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively
impractical thing to do.  Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes
or putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other forms
of impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.<br><br>But I had some more honest motives as well.  I thought studying
philosophy would be a shortcut straight to wisdom.  All the people
majoring in other things would just end up with a bunch of domain
knowledge.  I would be learning what was really what.<br><br>I&apos;d tried to read a few philosophy books.  Not recent ones; you
wouldn&apos;t find those in our high school library.  But I tried to
read Plato and Aristotle.  I doubt I believed I understood them,
but they sounded like they were talking about something important.
I assumed I&apos;d learn what in college.<br><br>The summer before senior year I took some college classes.  I learned
a lot in the calculus class, but I didn&apos;t learn much in Philosophy
101.  And yet my plan to study philosophy remained intact.  It was
my fault I hadn&apos;t learned anything.  I hadn&apos;t read the books we
were assigned carefully enough.  I&apos;d give Berkeley&apos;s <i>Principles
of Human Knowledge</i> another shot in college.  Anything so admired
and so difficult to read must have something in it, if one could
only figure out what.<br><br>Twenty-six years later, I still don&apos;t understand Berkeley.  I have
a nice edition of his collected works.  Will I ever read it?  Seems
unlikely.<br><br>The difference between then and now is that now I understand why
Berkeley is probably not worth trying to understand.  I think I see
now what went wrong with philosophy, and how we might fix it.<br><br><b>Words</b><br><br>I did end up being a philosophy major for most of college.  It
didn&apos;t work out as I&apos;d hoped.  I didn&apos;t learn any magical truths
compared to which everything else was mere domain knowledge.  But
I do at least know now why I didn&apos;t.  Philosophy doesn&apos;t really
have a subject matter in the way math or history or most other
university subjects do.  There is no core of knowledge one must
master.  The closest you come to that is a knowledge of what various
individual philosophers have said about different topics over the
years.  Few were sufficiently correct that people have forgotten
who discovered what they discovered.<br><br>Formal logic has some subject matter. I took several classes in
logic.  I don&apos;t know if I learned anything from them.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
It does seem to me very important to be able to flip ideas around in
one&apos;s head: to see when two ideas don&apos;t fully cover the space of
possibilities, or when one idea is the same as another but with a
couple things changed.  But did studying logic teach me the importance
of thinking this way, or make me any better at it?  I don&apos;t know.<br><br>There are things I know I learned from studying philosophy.  The
most dramatic I learned immediately, in the first semester of
freshman year, in a class taught by Sydney Shoemaker.  I learned
that I don&apos;t exist.  I am (and you are) a collection of cells that
lurches around driven by various forces, and calls itself <i>I</i>.  But
there&apos;s no central, indivisible thing that your identity goes with.
You could conceivably lose half your brain and live.  Which means
your brain could conceivably be split into two halves and each
transplanted into different bodies.  Imagine waking up after such
an operation.  You have to imagine being two people.<br><br>The real lesson here is that the concepts we use in everyday life
are fuzzy, and break down if pushed too hard.  Even a concept as
dear to us as <i>I</i>.  It took me a while to grasp this, but when I
did it was fairly sudden, like someone in the nineteenth century
grasping evolution and realizing the story of creation they&apos;d been
told as a child was all wrong. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Outside of math there&apos;s a limit
to how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad
definition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise
meanings.  Everyday words are inherently imprecise.  They work well
enough in everyday life that you don&apos;t notice.  Words seem to work,
just as Newtonian physics seems to.  But you can always make them
break if you push them far enough.<br><br>I would say that this has been, unfortunately for philosophy, the
central fact of philosophy.  Most philosophical debates are not
merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words.  Do we
have free will?  Depends what you mean by &quot;free.&quot; Do abstract ideas
exist?  Depends what you mean by &quot;exist.&quot;<br><br>Wittgenstein is popularly credited with the idea that most philosophical
controversies are due to confusions over language.  I&apos;m not sure
how much credit to give him.  I suspect a lot of people realized
this, but reacted simply by not studying philosophy, rather than
becoming philosophy professors.<br><br>How did things get this way?  Can something people have spent
thousands of years studying really be a waste of time?  Those are
interesting questions.  In fact, some of the most interesting
questions you can ask about philosophy.  The most valuable way to
approach the current philosophical tradition may be neither to get
lost in pointless speculations like Berkeley, nor to shut them down
like Wittgenstein, but to study it as an example of reason gone
wrong.<br><br><b>History</b><br><br>Western philosophy really begins with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.
What we know of their predecessors comes from fragments and references
in later works; their doctrines could be described as speculative
cosmology that occasionally strays into analysis.  Presumably they
were driven by whatever makes people in every other society invent
cosmologies.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>With Socrates, Plato, and particularly Aristotle, this tradition
turned a corner.  There started to be a lot more analysis.  I suspect
Plato and Aristotle were encouraged in this by progress in math.
Mathematicians had by then shown that you could figure things out
in a much more conclusive way than by making up fine sounding stories
about them.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>People talk so much about abstractions now that we don&apos;t realize
what a leap it must have been when they first started to.  It was
presumably many thousands of years between when people first started
describing things as hot or cold and when someone asked &quot;what is
heat?&quot;  No doubt it was a very gradual process.  We don&apos;t know if
Plato or Aristotle were the first to ask any of the questions they
did.  But their works are the oldest we have that do this on a large
scale, and there is a freshness (not to say naivete) about them
that suggests some of the questions they asked were new to them,
at least.<br><br>Aristotle in particular reminds me of the phenomenon that happens
when people discover something new, and are so excited by it that
they race through a huge percentage of the newly discovered territory
in one lifetime.  If so, that&apos;s evidence of how new this kind of
thinking was. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>This is all to explain how Plato and Aristotle can be very impressive
and yet naive and mistaken.  It was impressive even to ask the
questions they did.  That doesn&apos;t mean they always came up with
good answers.  It&apos;s not considered insulting to say that ancient
Greek mathematicians were naive in some respects, or at least lacked
some concepts that would have made their lives easier.  So I hope
people will not be too offended if I propose that ancient philosophers
were similarly naive.  In particular, they don&apos;t seem to have fully
grasped what I earlier called the central fact of philosophy: that
words break if you push them too far.<br><br>&quot;Much to the surprise of the builders of the first digital computers,&quot;
Rod Brooks wrote, &quot;programs written for them usually did not work.&quot;
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font>
Something similar happened when people first started trying
to talk about abstractions.  Much to their surprise, they didn&apos;t
arrive at answers they agreed upon.  In fact, they rarely seemed
to arrive at answers at all.<br><br>They were in effect arguing about artifacts induced by sampling at
too low a resolution.<br><br>The proof of how useless some of their answers turned out to be is
how little effect they have.  No one after reading Aristotle&apos;s
<i>Metaphysics</i> does anything differently as a result.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Surely I&apos;m not claiming that ideas have to have practical applications
to be interesting?  No, they may not have to.  Hardy&apos;s boast that
number theory had no use whatsoever wouldn&apos;t disqualify it.  But
he turned out to be mistaken.  In fact, it&apos;s suspiciously hard to
find a field of math that truly has no practical use.  And Aristotle&apos;s
explanation of the ultimate goal of philosophy in Book A of the
<i>Metaphysics</i> implies that philosophy should be useful too.<br><br><b>Theoretical Knowledge</b><br><br>Aristotle&apos;s goal was to find the most general of general principles.
The examples he gives are convincing: an ordinary worker builds
things a certain way out of habit; a master craftsman can do more
because he grasps the underlying principles.  The trend is clear:
the more general the knowledge, the more admirable it is.  But then
he makes a mistake&#x2014;possibly the most important mistake in the
history of philosophy.  He has noticed that theoretical knowledge
is often acquired for its own sake, out of curiosity, rather than
for any practical need.  So he proposes there are two kinds of
theoretical knowledge: some that&apos;s useful in practical matters and
some that isn&apos;t.  Since people interested in the latter are interested
in it for its own sake, it must be more noble.  So he sets as his
goal in the <i>Metaphysics</i> the exploration of knowledge that has no
practical use.  Which means no alarms go off when he takes on grand
but vaguely understood questions and ends up getting lost in a sea
of words.<br><br>His mistake was to confuse motive and result.  Certainly, people
who want a deep understanding of something are often driven by
curiosity rather than any practical need.  But that doesn&apos;t mean
what they end up learning is useless.  It&apos;s very valuable in practice
to have a deep understanding of what you&apos;re doing; even if you&apos;re
never called on to solve advanced problems, you can see shortcuts
in the solution of simple ones, and your knowledge won&apos;t break down
in edge cases, as it would if you were relying on formulas you
didn&apos;t understand.  Knowledge is power.  That&apos;s what makes theoretical
knowledge prestigious.  It&apos;s also what causes smart people to be
curious about certain things and not others; our DNA is not so
disinterested as we might think.<br><br>So while ideas don&apos;t have to have immediate practical applications
to be interesting, the kinds of things we find interesting will
surprisingly often turn out to have practical applications.<br><br>The reason Aristotle didn&apos;t get anywhere in the <i>Metaphysics</i> was
partly that he set off with contradictory aims: to explore the most
abstract ideas, guided by the assumption that they were useless.
He was like an explorer looking for a territory to the north of
him, starting with the assumption that it was located to the south.<br><br>And since his work became the map used by generations of future
explorers, he sent them off in the wrong direction as well. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font>
Perhaps worst of all, he protected them from both the criticism of
outsiders and the promptings of their own inner compass by establishing
the principle that the most noble sort of theoretical knowledge had
to be useless.<br><br>The <i>Metaphysics</i> is mostly a failed experiment.  A few ideas from
it turned out to be worth keeping; the bulk of it has had no effect
at all.  The <i>Metaphysics</i> is among the least read of all famous
books.  It&apos;s not hard to understand the way Newton&apos;s <i>Principia</i>
is, but the way a garbled message is.<br><br>Arguably it&apos;s an interesting failed experiment.  But unfortunately
that was not the conclusion Aristotle&apos;s successors derived from
works like the <i>Metaphysics</i>. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font>
Soon after, the western world
fell on intellectual hard times.  Instead of version 1s to be
superseded, the works of Plato and Aristotle became revered texts
to be mastered and discussed.  And so things remained for a shockingly
long time.  It was not till around 1600 (in Europe, where the center
of gravity had shifted by then) that one found people confident
enough to treat Aristotle&apos;s work as a catalog of mistakes.  And
even then they rarely said so outright.<br><br>If it seems surprising that the gap was so long, consider how little
progress there was in math between Hellenistic times and the
Renaissance.<br><br>In the intervening years an unfortunate idea took hold:  that it
was not only acceptable to produce works like the <i>Metaphysics</i>,
but that it was a particularly prestigious line of work, done by a
class of people called philosophers.  No one thought to go back and
debug Aristotle&apos;s motivating argument.  And so instead of correcting
the problem Aristotle discovered by falling into it&#x2014;that you can
easily get lost if you talk too loosely about very abstract ideas&#x2014;they 
continued to fall into it.<br><br><b>The Singularity</b><br><br>Curiously, however, the works they produced continued to attract
new readers.  Traditional philosophy occupies a kind of singularity
in this respect.  If you write in an unclear way about big ideas,
you produce something that seems tantalizingly attractive to
inexperienced but intellectually ambitious students.  Till one knows
better, it&apos;s hard to distinguish something that&apos;s hard to understand
because the writer was unclear in his own mind from something like
a mathematical proof that&apos;s hard to understand because the ideas
it represents are hard to understand.  To someone who hasn&apos;t learned
the difference, traditional philosophy seems extremely attractive:
as hard (and therefore impressive) as math, yet broader in scope.
That was what lured me in as a high school student.<br><br>This singularity is even more singular in having its own defense
built in.  When things are hard to understand, people who suspect
they&apos;re nonsense generally keep quiet.  There&apos;s no way to prove a
text is meaningless.  The closest you can get is to show that the
official judges of some class of texts can&apos;t distinguish them from
placebos. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>And so instead of denouncing philosophy, most people who suspected
it was a waste of time just studied other things.  That alone is
fairly damning evidence, considering philosophy&apos;s claims.  It&apos;s
supposed to be about the ultimate truths. Surely all smart people
would be interested in it, if it delivered on that promise.<br><br>Because philosophy&apos;s flaws turned away the sort of people who might
have corrected them, they tended to be self-perpetuating.  Bertrand
Russell wrote in a letter in 1912:
<blockquote>
  Hitherto the people attracted to philosophy have been mostly those
  who loved the big generalizations, which were all wrong, so that
  few people with exact minds have taken up the subject.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
His response was to launch Wittgenstein at it, with dramatic results.<br><br>I think Wittgenstein deserves to be famous not for the discovery
that most previous philosophy was a waste of time, which judging
from the circumstantial evidence must have been made by every smart
person who studied a little philosophy and declined to pursue it
further, but for how he acted in response.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font>
Instead of quietly
switching to another field, he made a fuss, from inside.  He was
Gorbachev.<br><br>The field of philosophy is still shaken from the fright Wittgenstein
gave it. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font>
Later in life he spent a lot of time talking about
how words worked.  Since that seems to be allowed, that&apos;s what a
lot of philosophers do now.  Meanwhile, sensing a vacuum in the
metaphysical speculation department, the people who used to do
literary criticism have been edging Kantward, under new names like
&quot;literary theory,&quot; &quot;critical theory,&quot; and when they&apos;re feeling
ambitious, plain &quot;theory.&quot;  The writing is the familiar word salad:
<blockquote>
  Gender is not like some of the other grammatical modes which
  express precisely a mode of conception without any reality that
  corresponds to the conceptual mode, and consequently do not express
  precisely something in reality by which the intellect could be
  moved to conceive a thing the way it does, even where that motive
  is not something in the thing as such.
  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#999999">14</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
The singularity I&apos;ve described is not going away.  There&apos;s a market
for writing that sounds impressive and can&apos;t be disproven. There
will always be both supply and demand.  So if one group abandons
this territory, there will always be others ready to occupy it.<br><br><b>A Proposal</b><br><br>We may be able to do better.  Here&apos;s an intriguing possibility.
Perhaps we should do what Aristotle meant to do, instead of what
he did.  The goal he announces in the <i>Metaphysics</i> seems one worth
pursuing: to discover the most general truths.  That sounds good.
But instead of trying to discover them because they&apos;re useless,
let&apos;s try to discover them because they&apos;re useful.<br><br>I propose we try again, but that we use that heretofore despised
criterion, applicability, as a guide to keep us from wondering
off into a swamp of abstractions.  Instead of trying to answer the
question:
<blockquote>
  What are the most general truths?
</blockquote>
let&apos;s try to answer the question
<blockquote>
  Of all the useful things we can say, which are the most general?
</blockquote>
The test of utility I propose is whether we cause people who read
what we&apos;ve written to do anything differently afterward.  Knowing
we have to give definite (if implicit) advice will keep us from
straying beyond the resolution of the words we&apos;re using.<br><br>The goal is the same as Aristotle&apos;s; we just approach it from a
different direction.<br><br>As an example of a useful, general idea, consider that of the
controlled experiment.  There&apos;s an idea that has turned out to be
widely applicable.  Some might say it&apos;s part of science, but it&apos;s
not part of any specific science; it&apos;s literally meta-physics (in
our sense of &quot;meta&quot;).   The idea of evolution is another. It turns
out to have quite broad applications&#x2014;for example, in genetic
algorithms and even product design.  Frankfurt&apos;s distinction between
lying and bullshitting seems a promising recent example.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#999999">15</font></a>]</font><br><br>These seem to me what philosophy should look like: quite general
observations that would cause someone who understood them to do
something differently.<br><br>Such observations will necessarily be about things that are imprecisely
defined.  Once you start using words with precise meanings, you&apos;re
doing math.  So starting from utility won&apos;t entirely solve the
problem I described above&#x2014;it won&apos;t flush out the metaphysical
singularity.  But it should help.  It gives people with good
intentions a new roadmap into abstraction.  And they may thereby
produce things that make the writing of the people with bad intentions
look bad by comparison.<br><br>One drawback of this approach is that it won&apos;t produce the sort of
writing that gets you tenure.  And not just because it&apos;s not currently
the fashion.  In order to get tenure in any field you must not
arrive at conclusions that members of tenure committees can disagree
with.  In practice there are two kinds of solutions to this problem.
In math and the sciences, you can prove what you&apos;re saying, or at
any rate adjust your conclusions so you&apos;re not claiming anything
false (&quot;6 of 8 subjects had lower blood pressure after the treatment&quot;).
In the humanities you can either avoid drawing any definite conclusions
(e.g. conclude that an issue is a complex one), or draw conclusions
so narrow that no one cares enough to disagree with you.<br><br>The kind of philosophy I&apos;m advocating won&apos;t be able to take either
of these routes.  At best you&apos;ll be able to achieve the essayist&apos;s
standard of proof, not the mathematician&apos;s or the experimentalist&apos;s.
And yet you won&apos;t be able to meet the usefulness test without
implying definite and fairly broadly applicable conclusions.  Worse
still, the usefulness test will tend to produce results that annoy
people: there&apos;s no use in telling people things they already believe,
and people are often upset to be told things they don&apos;t.<br><br>Here&apos;s the exciting thing, though.  Anyone can do this.  Getting
to general plus useful by starting with useful and cranking up the
generality may be unsuitable for junior professors trying to get
tenure, but it&apos;s better for everyone else, including professors who
already have it.  This side of the mountain is a nice gradual slope.
You can start by writing things that are useful but very specific,
and then gradually make them more general.  Joe&apos;s has good burritos.
What makes a good burrito?  What makes good food?  What makes
anything good?  You can take as long as you want.  You don&apos;t have
to get all the way to the top of the mountain.  You don&apos;t have to
tell anyone you&apos;re doing philosophy.<br><br>If it seems like a daunting task to do philosophy, here&apos;s an
encouraging thought.  The field is a lot younger than it seems.
Though the first philosophers in the western tradition lived about
2500 years ago, it would be misleading to say the field is 2500
years old, because for most of that time the leading practitioners
weren&apos;t doing much more than writing commentaries on Plato or
Aristotle while watching over their shoulders for the next invading
army.  In the times when they weren&apos;t, philosophy was hopelessly
intermingled with religion.  It didn&apos;t shake itself free till a
couple hundred years ago, and even then was afflicted by the
structural problems I&apos;ve described above.  If I say this, some will
say it&apos;s a ridiculously overbroad and uncharitable generalization,
and others will say it&apos;s old news, but here goes: judging from their
works, most philosophers up to the present have been wasting their
time.  So in a sense the field is still at the first step. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#999999">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>That sounds a preposterous claim to make.  It won&apos;t seem so
preposterous in 10,000 years.  Civilization always seems old, because
it&apos;s always the oldest it&apos;s ever been.  The only way to say whether
something is really old or not is by looking at structural evidence,
and structurally philosophy is young; it&apos;s still reeling from the
unexpected breakdown of words.<br><br>Philosophy is as young now as math was in 1500.  There is a lot
more to discover.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br><!-- (Sorry there are so many notes.  This is a topic with many branches,

In practice formal logic is not much use, because despite
some progress in the last 150 years we&apos;re still only able to formalize
a small percentage of statements.  We may never do that much better,
for the same reason 1980s-style &quot;knowledge representation&quot; could
never have worked; many statements may have no representation more
concise than a huge, analog brain state.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
It was harder for Darwin&apos;s contemporaries to grasp this than
we can easily imagine.  The story of creation in the Bible is not
just a Judeo-Christian concept; it&apos;s roughly what everyone must
have believed since before people were people.  The hard part of
grasping evolution was to realize that species weren&apos;t, as they
seem to be, unchanging, but had instead evolved from different,
simpler organisms over unimaginably long periods of time.<br><br>Now we don&apos;t have to make that leap.  No one in an industrialized
country encounters the idea of evolution for the first time as an
adult.  Everyone&apos;s taught about it as a child, either as truth or
heresy.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Greek philosophers before Plato wrote in verse.  This must
have affected what they said.  If you try to write about the nature
of the world in verse, it inevitably turns into incantation.  Prose
lets you be more precise, and more tentative.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Philosophy is like math&apos;s
ne&apos;er-do-well brother.  It was born when Plato and Aristotle looked
at the works of their predecessors and said in effect &quot;why can&apos;t
you be more like your brother?&quot;  Russell was still saying the same
thing 2300 years later.<br><br>Math is the precise half of the most abstract ideas, and philosophy
the imprecise half.  It&apos;s probably inevitable that philosophy will
suffer by comparison, because there&apos;s no lower bound to its precision.
Bad math is merely boring, whereas bad philosophy is nonsense.  And
yet there are <i>some</i> good ideas in the imprecise half.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Aristotle&apos;s best work was in logic and zoology, both of which
he can  be said to have invented.  But the most dramatic departure
from his predecessors was a new, much more analytical style of
thinking.  He was arguably the first scientist.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]

Some would say we depend on Aristotle more than we realize,
because his ideas were one of the ingredients in our common culture.
Certainly a lot of the words we use have a connection with Aristotle,
but it seems a bit much to suggest that we wouldn&apos;t have the concept
of the essence of something or the distinction between matter and
form if Aristotle hadn&apos;t written about them.<br><br>One way to see how much we really depend on Aristotle would be to
diff European culture with Chinese: what ideas did European culture
have in 1800 that Chinese culture didn&apos;t, in virtue of Aristotle&apos;s
contribution?<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
The meaning of the word &quot;philosophy&quot; has changed over time.
In ancient times it covered a broad range of topics, comparable in
scope to our &quot;scholarship&quot; (though without the methodological
implications).  Even as late as Newton&apos;s time it included what we
now call &quot;science.&quot;  But core of the subject today is still what
seemed to Aristotle the core: the attempt to discover the most
general truths.<br><br>Aristotle didn&apos;t call this &quot;metaphysics.&quot;  That name got assigned
to it because the books we now call the <i>Metaphysics</i> came after
(meta = after) the <i>Physics</i> in the standard edition of Aristotle&apos;s
works compiled by Andronicus of Rhodes three centuries later.  What
we call &quot;metaphysics&quot; Aristotle called &quot;first philosophy.&quot;<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]

Some introductions to philosophy now take the line that
philosophy is worth studying as a process rather than for any
particular truths you&apos;ll learn.  The philosophers whose works they
cover would be rolling in their graves at that.  They hoped they
were doing more than serving as examples of how to argue: they hoped
they were getting results.  Most were wrong, but it doesn&apos;t seem
an impossible hope.<br><br>This argument seems to me like someone in 1500 looking at the lack
of results achieved by alchemy and saying its value was as a process.
No, they were going about it wrong.  It turns out it is possible
to transmute lead into gold (though not economically at current
energy prices), but the route to that knowledge was to
backtrack and try another approach.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston,

<p>
October 2007<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a keynote at FOWA in October 2007.)</i><br><br>There&apos;s something interesting happening right now.  Startups are
undergoing the same transformation that technology does when it becomes
cheaper.<br><br>It&apos;s a pattern we see over and over in technology.  Initially
there&apos;s some device that&apos;s very expensive and made
in small quantities.  Then someone discovers how to make them cheaply; 
many more get built; and as a result they can be used in new ways.<br><br>Computers are a familiar example.  When I was a kid, computers were
big, expensive machines built one at a time.  Now they&apos;re a commodity.
Now we can stick computers in everything.<br><br>This pattern is very old.  Most of the turning
points in economic history are instances of it.  It happened to
steel in the 1850s, and to power in the 1780s.
It happened to cloth manufacture in the thirteenth century, generating
the wealth that later brought about the Renaissance.  Agriculture
itself was an instance of this pattern.<br><br>Now as well as being produced by startups, this pattern
is happening <i>to</i> startups.  It&apos;s so cheap to start web startups
that orders of magnitudes more will be started.   If the pattern
holds true, that should cause dramatic changes.<br><br><b>1. Lots of Startups</b><br><br>So my first prediction about the future of web startups is pretty
straightforward: there will be a lot of them.  When starting a
startup was expensive, you had to get the permission of investors
to do it.  Now the only threshold is courage.<br><br>Even that threshold is getting lower, as people watch others take
the plunge and survive.  In the last batch of startups we funded,
we had several founders who said they&apos;d thought of applying before,
but weren&apos;t sure and got jobs instead.  It was only after hearing
reports of friends who&apos;d done it that they decided to try it
themselves.<br><br>Starting a startup is hard, but having a 9 to 5 job is hard too,
and in some ways a worse kind of hard.  In a startup you have lots
of worries, but you don&apos;t have that feeling that your life is flying
by like you do in a big company.  Plus in a startup you could make
much more money.<br><br>As word spreads that startups work, the number may grow
to a point that would now seem surprising.<br><br>We now think of it as normal to have a job at a company, but this
is the thinnest of historical veneers.  Just two or three
lifetimes ago, most people in what are now called industrialized
countries lived by farming.  So while it may seem surprising to
propose that large numbers of people will change the way they make
a living, it would be more surprising if they didn&apos;t.<br><br><b>2. Standardization</b><br><br>When technology makes something dramatically cheaper, standardization
always follows.  When you make things in large volumes you tend
to standardize everything that doesn&apos;t need to change.<br><br>At Y Combinator we still only have four people, so we try to
standardize everything.  We could hire employees, but we want to be
forced to figure out how to scale investing.<br><br>We often tell startups to release a minimal version one quickly, 
then let the needs of the users determine what to do
next.  In essense, let the market design the product.  We&apos;ve
done the same thing ourselves.  We think of the techniques we&apos;re
developing for dealing with large numbers of startups as like
software.  Sometimes it literally is software, like 
<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> and
our application system.<br><br>One of the most important things we&apos;ve been working on standardizing
are investment terms.  Till now investment terms have been
individually negotiated.
This is a problem for founders, because it makes raising money
take longer and cost more in legal fees.  So as well as using the
same paperwork for every deal we do, we&apos;ve commissioned generic
angel paperwork that all the startups we fund can use for future
rounds.<br><br>Some investors will still want to cook up their own deal terms.
Series A rounds, where you raise a million dollars or more, will
be custom deals for the forseeable future.  But I think angel rounds
will start to be done mostly with standardized agreements.  An angel
who wants to insert a bunch of complicated terms into the agreement
is probably not one you want anyway.<br><br><b>3. New Attitude to Acquisition</b><br><br>Another thing I see starting to get standardized is acquisitions.
As the volume of startups increases, big companies will start to
develop standardized procedures that make acquisitions little
more work than hiring someone.<br><br>Google is the leader here, as in so many areas of technology.  They
buy a lot of startups&#x2014; more than most people realize, because they
only announce a fraction of them.   And being Google, they&apos;re
figuring out how to do it efficiently.<br><br>One problem they&apos;ve solved is how to think about acquisitions.  For
most companies, acquisitions still carry some stigma of inadequacy.
Companies do them because they have to, but there&apos;s usually some
feeling they shouldn&apos;t have to&#x2014;that their own programmers should
be able to build everything they need.<br><br>Google&apos;s example should cure the rest of the world of this idea.
Google has by far the best programmers of any public technology
company.  If they don&apos;t have a problem doing acquisitions, the
others should have even less problem.  However many Google does,
Microsoft should do ten times as many.<br><br>One reason Google doesn&apos;t have a problem with acquisitions
is that they know first-hand the quality of the people they can get
that way.  Larry and Sergey only started Google after making the
rounds of the search engines trying to sell their idea and finding
no takers.  They&apos;ve <i>been</i> the guys coming in to visit the big
company, so they know who might be sitting across that conference
table from them.<br><br><b>4. Riskier Strategies are Possible</b><br><br>Risk is always proportionate to reward.  The way to get really big
returns is to do things that seem crazy, like starting a new search
engine in 1998, or turning down a billion dollar acquisition offer.<br><br>This has traditionally been a problem in venture funding.  Founders
and investors have different attitudes to risk.  Knowing that risk
is on average proportionate to reward, investors like risky strategies,
while founders, who don&apos;t have a big enough sample size to care
what&apos;s true on average, tend to be more conservative.<br><br>If startups are easy to start, this conflict goes away, because
founders can start them younger, when it&apos;s rational to take more
risk, and can start more startups total in their careers.  When
founders can do lots of startups, they can start to look at the
world in the same portfolio-optimizing way as investors.  And that
means the overall amount of wealth created can be greater, because
strategies can be riskier.<br><br><b>5. Younger, Nerdier Founders</b><br><br>If startups become a cheap commodity, more people will be able to
have them, just as more people could have computers once microprocessors
made them cheap.  And in particular, younger and more technical
founders will be able to start startups than could before.<br><br>Back when it cost a lot to start a startup, you had to convince
investors to let you do it.  And that required very different skills
from actually doing the startup.  If investors were perfect judges,
the two would require exactly the same skills.  But unfortunately
most investors are terrible judges.  I know because I see behind
the scenes what an enormous amount of work it takes to raise money,
and the amount of selling required in an industry is always inversely
proportional to the judgement of the buyers.<br><br>Fortunately, if startups get cheaper to start, there&apos;s another way
to convince investors.  Instead of going to venture capitalists
with a business plan and trying to convince them to fund it, you
can get a product launched on a few tens of thousands of dollars
of seed money from us or your uncle, and approach them with a
working company instead of a plan for one.  Then instead of
having to seem smooth and confident, you can just point them to
Alexa.<br><br>This way of convincing investors is better suited to hackers, who
often went into technology in part because they felt uncomfortable
with the amount of fakeness required in other fields.<br><br><b>6. Startup Hubs Will Persist</b><br><br>It might seem that if startups get cheap to start, it will mean the
end of startup hubs like Silicon Valley.  If all you need to start
a startup is rent money, you should be able to do it anywhere.<br><br>This is kind of true and kind of false.  It&apos;s true that you can now
<i>start</i> a startup anywhere.  But you have to do more with a
startup than just start it.  You have to make it succeed.  And that
is more likely to happen in a startup hub.<br><br>I&apos;ve thought a lot about this question, and it seems to me the
increasing cheapness of web startups will if anything increase the
importance of startup hubs.  The value of startup hubs, like centers
for any kind of business, lies in something very old-fashioned:
face to face meetings.  No technology in the immediate future will
replace walking down University Ave and running into a friend who
tells you how to fix a bug that&apos;s been bothering you all weekend,
or visiting a friend&apos;s startup down the street and ending up in a
conversation with one of their investors.<br><br>The question of whether to be in a startup hub is like the question
of whether to take outside investment.  The question is not whether
you <i>need</i> it, but whether it brings any advantage at all.
Because anything that brings an advantage will give your competitors
an advantage over you if they do it and you don&apos;t.  So if you hear
someone saying &quot;we don&apos;t need to be in Silicon Valley,&quot; that use
of the word &quot;need&quot; is a sign they&apos;re not even thinking about the
question right.<br><br>And while startup hubs are as powerful magnets as ever, the increasing
cheapness of starting a startup means the particles they&apos;re attracting
are getting lighter.  A startup now can be just a pair of 22 year
old guys.  A company like that can move much more easily than one
with 10 people, half of whom have kids.<br><br>We know because we make people move for Y Combinator, and it doesn&apos;t
seem to be a problem. The advantage of being able to work together
face to face for three months outweighs the inconvenience of moving.
Ask anyone who&apos;s done it.<br><br>The mobility of seed-stage startups means that seed funding is a
national business.  One of the most common emails we get is from
people asking if we can help them set up a local clone of Y Combinator.
But this just wouldn&apos;t work. Seed funding isn&apos;t regional, just as
big research universities aren&apos;t.<br><br>Is seed funding not merely national, but international?  Interesting
question.  There are signs it may be.  We&apos;ve had an ongoing
stream of founders from outside the US, and they tend to do
particularly well, because they&apos;re all people who were so determined
to succeed that they were willing to move to another country to do
it.<br><br>The more mobile startups get, the harder it would be to start new 
silicon valleys.  If startups are mobile, the best local talent 
will go to the real Silicon Valley,
and all they&apos;ll get at the local one will be the people who didn&apos;t
have the energy to move.<br><br>This is not a nationalistic idea, incidentally.  It&apos;s cities that
compete, not countries.  Atlanta is just as hosed as Munich.<br><br><b>7. Better Judgement Needed</b><br><br>If the number of startups increases dramatically, then the people
whose job is to judge them are going to have to get better at
it.  I&apos;m thinking particularly of investors and acquirers.  We now
get on the order of 1000 applications a year.  What are we going
to do if we get 10,000?<br><br>That&apos;s actually an alarming idea.  But we&apos;ll figure out some kind
of answer.  We&apos;ll have to.  It will probably involve writing some
software, but fortunately we can do that.<br><br>Acquirers will also have to get better at picking winners.   
They generally do better than investors, because they pick
later, when there&apos;s more performance to measure.  But even at the
most advanced acquirers, identifying companies to
buy is extremely ad hoc, and completing the acquisition often
involves a great deal of unneccessary friction.<br><br>I think acquirers may eventually have chief acquisition officers
who will both identify good acquisitions and make the deals happen.
At the moment those two functions are separate.  Promising new
startups are often discovered by developers.  If someone powerful
enough wants to buy them, the deal is handed over to corp dev guys
to negotiate.  It would be better if both were combined in
one group, headed by someone with a technical background and some
vision of what they wanted to accomplish.  Maybe in the future big
companies will have both a VP of Engineering responsible for
technology developed in-house, and a CAO responsible for bringing
technology in from outside.<br><br>At the moment, there is no one within big companies who gets in
trouble when they buy a startup for $200 million that they could
have bought earlier for $20 million.  There should start to be
someone who gets in trouble for that.<br><br><b>8. College Will Change</b><br><br>If the best hackers start their own companies after college
instead of getting jobs, that will change what happens in college.
Most of these changes will be for the better.  I think the experience
of college is warped in a bad way by the expectation that afterward
you&apos;ll be judged by potential employers.<br><br>One change will be in the meaning of &quot;after
college,&quot; which will switch from when one graduates from college
to when one leaves it.  If you&apos;re starting your own company, why
do you need a degree?  We don&apos;t encourage people to start startups
during college, but the best founders are certainly
capable of it.  Some of the most successful companies we&apos;ve funded
were started by undergrads.<br><br>I grew up in a time where college degrees seemed really important,
so I&apos;m alarmed to be saying things like this, but there&apos;s nothing
magical about a degree.  There&apos;s nothing that magically changes
after you take that last exam.  The importance of degrees is due
solely to the administrative needs of large organizations.  These
can certainly affect your life&#x2014;it&apos;s hard to get into grad
school, or to get a work visa in the US, without an undergraduate
degree&#x2014;but tests like this will matter less and
less.<br><br>As well as mattering less whether students get degrees, it will
also start to matter less where they go to college.  In a startup
you&apos;re judged by users, and they don&apos;t care where you went to
college.  So in a world of startups, elite universities will play
less of a role as gatekeepers.  In the US it&apos;s a national scandal
how easily children of rich parents game college admissions.
But the way this problem ultimately gets solved may not be by
reforming the universities but by going around them.  We in the
technology world are used to that sort of solution: you don&apos;t beat
the incumbents; you redefine the problem to make them irrelevant.<br><br>The greatest value of universities is not the brand name or perhaps
even the classes so much as the people you meet.  If
it becomes common to start a startup after college, students may start
trying to maximize this.  Instead of focusing on getting
internships at companies they want to work for, they may start
to focus on working with other students they want as cofounders.<br><br>What students do in their classes will change too.  Instead of
trying to get good grades to impress future employers, students
will try to learn things.  We&apos;re talking about some pretty dramatic
changes here.<br><br><b>9. Lots of Competitors</b><br><br>If it gets easier to start a startup, it&apos;s easier for competitors too. 
That doesn&apos;t erase the advantage of
increased cheapness, however.  You&apos;re not all playing a zero-sum
game.  There&apos;s not some fixed number of startups that can succeed,
regardless of how many are started.<br><br>In fact, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any limit to the number of startups
that could succeed.  Startups succeed by creating wealth, which is
the satisfaction of people&apos;s desires.  And people&apos;s desires seem
to be effectively infinite, at least in the short term.<br><br>What the increasing number of startups does mean is that you won&apos;t
be able to sit on a good idea.  Other people have your idea, and
they&apos;ll be increasingly likely to do something about it.<br><br><b>10. Faster Advances</b><br><br>There&apos;s a good side to that, at least for consumers of
technology.  If people get right to work implementing ideas instead
of sitting on them, technology will evolve faster.<br><br>Some kinds of innovations happen a company at a time, like the
punctuated equilibrium model of evolution.  There are some kinds
of ideas that are so threatening that it&apos;s hard for big companies
even to think of them.  Look at what a hard time Microsoft is
having discovering web apps.  They&apos;re like a character in a movie
that everyone in the audience can see something bad is about to
happen to, but who can&apos;t see it himself.  The big innovations
that happen a company at a time will obviously happen faster if
the rate of new companies increases.<br><br>But in fact there will be a double speed increase.  People won&apos;t
wait as long to act on new ideas, but also those ideas will
increasingly be developed within startups rather than big companies.
Which means technology will evolve faster per company as well.<br><br>Big companies are just not a good place to make things happen fast.
I talked recently to a founder whose startup had been acquired by
a big company.  He was a precise sort of guy, so he&apos;d measured their
productivity before and after.  He counted lines of code, which can
be a dubious measure, but in this case was meaningful because it
was the same group of programmers.  He found they were one thirteenth
as productive after the acquisition.<br><br>The company that bought them was not a particularly stupid one.
I think what he was measuring was mostly the cost of bigness.  I
experienced this myself, and his number sounds about right.  There&apos;s
something about big companies that just sucks the energy out of
you.<br><br>Imagine what all that energy could do if it were put to use.  There
is an enormous latent capacity in the world&apos;s hackers that most
people don&apos;t even realize is there.  That&apos;s the main reason we do
Y Combinator: to let loose all this energy by making it easy for
hackers to start their own startups.<br><br><b>A Series of Tubes</b><br><br>The process of starting startups is currently like the plumbing in
an old house.  The pipes are narrow and twisty, and there are leaks
in every joint.  In the future this mess will gradually be replaced
by a single, huge pipe.  The water will still have to get from A
to B, but it will get there faster and without the risk of spraying
out through some random leak.<br><br>This will change a lot of things for the better.  In a big, straight
pipe like that, the force of being measured by one&apos;s performance
will propagate back through the whole system.  Performance is always
the ultimate test, but there are so many kinks in the plumbing now
that most people are insulated from it most of the time.  So you
end up with a world in which high school students think they need
to get good grades to get into elite colleges, and college students
think they need to get good grades to impress employers, within
which the employees waste most of their time in political battles,
and from which consumers have to buy anyway because there are so
few choices.  Imagine if that sequence became a big, straight pipe.
Then the effects of being measured by performance would propagate
all the way back to high school, flushing out all the arbitrary
stuff people are measured by now.  That is the future of web startups.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Brian Oberkirch and Simon Willison for inviting me to

<a href="webstartups.html">talk</a> I gave, one of the organizers 
got up on the
stage to deliver an impromptu rebuttal.  That never happened before.
I only heard the first few sentences, but that was enough to tell
what I said that upset him: that startups would do better if they
moved to Silicon Valley.<br><br>This conference was in London, and most of the audience seemed to
be from the UK.  So saying startups should move to Silicon Valley
seemed like a nationalistic remark: an obnoxious American telling
them that if they wanted to do things right they should all just
move to America.<br><br>Actually I&apos;m less American than I seem.  I didn&apos;t say so, but I&apos;m
British by birth.  And just as Jews are ex officio allowed to tell
Jewish jokes, I don&apos;t feel like I have to bother being diplomatic
with a British audience.<br><br>The idea that startups would do better to move to Silicon Valley
is not even a nationalistic one.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
It&apos;s the same thing I say to
startups in the US.  Y Combinator alternates between coasts every
6 months. Every other funding cycle is in Boston.  And even though
Boston is the second biggest startup hub in the US (and the world),
we tell the startups from those cycles that their best bet is to
move to Silicon Valley.  If that&apos;s true of Boston, it&apos;s even more
true of every other city.<br><br>This is about cities, not countries.<br><br>And I think I can prove I&apos;m right.  You can easily reduce the
opposing argument ad what most people would agree was absurdum.
Few would be willing to claim that it doesn&apos;t matter at all where
a startup is&#x2014;that a startup operating out of a small agricultural
town wouldn&apos;t benefit from moving to a startup hub.  Most people
could see how it might be helpful to be in a place where there was
infrastructure for startups, accumulated knowledge about how to
make them work, and other people trying to do it.  And yet whatever
argument you use to prove that startups don&apos;t need to move from
London to Silicon Valley could equally well be used to prove startups
don&apos;t need to move from smaller towns to London.<br><br>The difference between cities is a matter of degree.  And if, as
nearly everyone who knows agrees, startups are better off in Silicon
Valley than Boston, then they&apos;re better off in Silicon Valley than
everywhere else too.<br><br>I realize I might seem to have a vested interest in this conclusion,
because startups that move to the US might do it through Y Combinator.
But the American startups we&apos;ve funded will attest that I say the
same thing to them.<br><br>I&apos;m not claiming of course that every startup has to go to Silicon
Valley to succeed.  Just that all other things being equal, the
more of a startup hub a place is, the better startups will do there.
But other considerations can outweigh the advantages of moving.
I&apos;m not saying founders with families should uproot them to move
halfway around the world; that might be too much of a distraction.<br><br>Immigration difficulties might be another reason to stay put.
Dealing with immigration problems is like raising money: for some
reason it seems to consume all your attention.  A startup can&apos;t
afford much of that.  One Canadian startup we funded spent about 6
months working on moving to the US.  Eventually they just gave up,
because they couldn&apos;t afford to take so much time away from working
on their software.<br><br>(If another country wanted to establish a rival to Silicon Valley,
the single best thing they could do might be to create a special
visa for startup founders.  US immigration policy is one of Silicon 
Valley&apos;s biggest weaknesses.)<br><br>If your startup is connected to a specific industry, you may be
better off in one of its centers.  A startup doing something related
to entertainment might want to be in New York or LA.<br><br>And finally, if a good investor has committed to fund
you if you stay where you are, you should probably stay.  Finding
investors is hard.  You generally shouldn&apos;t pass up a definite
funding offer to move.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>In fact, the quality of the investors may be the main advantage of
startup hubs.  Silicon Valley investors are noticeably more aggressive
than Boston ones.  Over and over, I&apos;ve seen startups we&apos;ve funded
snatched by west coast investors out from under the noses of Boston
investors who saw them first but acted too slowly.  At this year&apos;s
Boston Demo Day, I told the audience that this happened every year,
so if they saw a startup they liked, they should make them an offer.
And yet within a month it had happened again: an aggressive west
coast VC who had met the founder of a YC-funded startup a week
before beat out a Boston VC who had known him for years.  By the
time the Boston VC grasped what was happening, the deal was already
gone.<br><br>Boston investors will admit they&apos;re more conservative.  Some want
to believe this comes from the city&apos;s prudent Yankee character.
But Occam&apos;s razor suggests the truth is less flattering.  Boston
investors are probably more conservative than Silicon Valley investors
for the same reason Chicago investors are more conservative than
Boston ones.  They don&apos;t understand startups as well.<br><br>West coast investors aren&apos;t bolder because they&apos;re irresponsible
cowboys, or because the good weather makes them optimistic.  They&apos;re
bolder because they know what they&apos;re doing.  They&apos;re the skiers
who ski on the diamond slopes.  Boldness is the essence of venture
investing.  The way you get big returns is not by trying to avoid
losses, but by trying to ensure you get some of the big hits. And
the big hits often look risky at first.<br><br>Like Facebook.  Facebook was started in Boston.  Boston VCs had the
first shot at them.  But they said no, so Facebook moved to Silicon
Valley and raised money there.  The partner who turned them down
now says that &quot;may turn out to have been a mistake.&quot;<br><br>Empirically, boldness wins.  If the aggressive ways of west coast
investors are going to come back to bite them, it has been a long
time coming.  Silicon Valley has been pulling ahead of Boston since
the 1970s.  If there was going to be a comeuppance for the west
coast investors, the bursting of the Bubble would have been it.
But since then the west coast has just pulled further ahead.<br><br>West coast investors are confident enough of their judgement to act
boldly; east coast investors, not so much; but anyone who thinks
east coast investors act that way out of prudence should see the
frantic reactions of an east coast VC in the process of losing a
deal to a west coast one.<br><br>In addition to the concentration that comes from specialization,
startup hubs are also markets.  And markets are usually centralized.
Even now, when traders could be anywhere, they cluster in a few
cities.  It&apos;s hard to say exactly what it is about face to face
contact that makes deals happen, but whatever it is, it hasn&apos;t yet
been duplicated by technology.<br><br>Walk down University Ave at the right time, and you might overhear
five different people talking on the phone about deals.  In fact,
this is part of the reason Y Combinator is in Boston half the time:
it&apos;s hard to stand that year round.  But though it can sometimes
be annoying to be surrounded by people who only think about one
thing, it&apos;s the place to be if that one thing is what you&apos;re trying
to do.<br><br>I was talking recently to someone who works on search at Google.
He knew a lot of people at Yahoo, so he was in a good position to
compare the two companies.  I asked him why Google was better at
search.  He said it wasn&apos;t anything specific Google did, but simply
that they understood search so much better.<br><br>And that&apos;s why startups thrive in startup hubs like Silicon Valley.
Startups are a very specialized business, as specialized as diamond
cutting.  And in startup hubs they understand it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
The nationalistic idea is the converse: that startups should
stay in a certain city because of the country it&apos;s in.  If you
really have a &quot;one world&quot; viewpoint, deciding to move from London
to Silicon Valley is no different from deciding to move from Chicago
to Silicon Valley.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
An investor who merely seems like he will fund you, however,
you can ignore.  Seeming like they will fund you one day is the way
investors say No.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, Harjeet Taggar, and Kulveer

an unexpected consequence: it made me realize I had a design
philosophy.  The main complaint of the more articulate critics was
that Arc seemed so flimsy. After years of working on it, all I had
to show for myself were a few thousand lines of macros?  Why hadn&apos;t
I worked on more substantial problems?<br><br>As I was mulling over these remarks it struck me how familiar they
seemed.  This was exactly the kind of thing people said at first
about Viaweb, and Y Combinator, and most of my essays.<br><br>When we launched Viaweb, it seemed laughable to VCs and e-commerce
&quot;experts.&quot;  We were just a couple guys in an apartment,
which did not seem cool in 1995 the way it does now.  And the thing
we&apos;d built, as far as they could tell, wasn&apos;t even software.
Software, to them, equalled big, honking Windows apps.  Since Viaweb
was the first <xa href="road.html">web-based app 
they&apos;d seen, it seemed to be nothing
more than a website.  They were even more contemptuous when they
discovered that Viaweb didn&apos;t process credit card transactions (we
didn&apos;t for the whole first year).  Transaction processing seemed
to them what e-commerce was all about.  It sounded serious and
difficult.<br><br>And yet, mysteriously, Viaweb ended up crushing all its competitors.<br><br>The initial reaction to 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> was almost identical.  It
seemed laughably lightweight.  Startup funding meant series A rounds:
millions of dollars given to a small number of startups founded by
people with established credentials after months of serious,
businesslike meetings, on terms described in a document a foot
thick.  Y Combinator seemed inconsequential.  It&apos;s too early to say
yet whether Y Combinator will turn out like Viaweb, but judging
from the number of imitations, a lot of people seem to think we&apos;re
on to something.<br><br>I can&apos;t measure whether my essays are successful, except in page
views, but the reaction to them is at least different from when I
started.  At first the default reaction of the Slashdot trolls was
(translated into articulate terms): &quot;Who is this guy and what
authority does he have to write about these topics?  I haven&apos;t read
the essay, but there&apos;s no way anything so short and written in such
an informal style could have anything useful to say about such and
such topic, when people with degrees in the subject have already
written many thick books about it.&quot; Now there&apos;s a new generation
of trolls on a new generation of sites, but they have at least
started to omit the initial &quot;Who is this guy?&quot;<br><br>Now people are saying the same things about Arc that they said at
first about Viaweb and Y Combinator and most of my essays.  Why the
pattern?  The answer, I realized, is that my m.o. for all four has
been the same.<br><br>Here it is: I like to find (a) simple solutions (b) to overlooked
problems (c) that actually need to be solved, and (d) deliver them
as informally as possible, (e) starting with a very crude version
1, then (f) iterating rapidly.<br><br>When I first laid out these principles explicitly, I noticed something
striking: this is practically a recipe for generating a contemptuous
initial reaction.  Though simple solutions are better, they don&apos;t
seem as impressive as complex ones.  Overlooked problems are by
definition problems that most people think don&apos;t matter.  Delivering
solutions in an informal way means that instead of judging something
by the way it&apos;s presented, people have to actually understand it,
which is more work.  And starting with a crude version 1 means your
initial effort is always small and incomplete.<br><br>I&apos;d noticed, of course, that people never seemed to grasp new ideas
at first.  I thought it was just because most people were stupid.
Now I see there&apos;s more to it than that.  <!-- This particular m.o. is
practically tuned to hit everyday stupidity square on. --> Like a
contrarian investment fund, someone following this strategy will
almost always be doing things that seem wrong to the average person.<br><br>As with contrarian investment strategies, that&apos;s exactly the point.
This technique is successful (in the long term) because it gives you
all the advantages other people forgo by trying to seem legit.  If
you work on overlooked problems, you&apos;re more likely to discover new
things, because you have less competition.  If you deliver solutions
informally, you (a) save all the effort you would have had to expend
to make them look impressive, and (b) avoid the danger of fooling
yourself as well as your audience.  And if you release a crude
version 1 then iterate, your solution can benefit from the imagination
of nature, which, as Feynman pointed out, is more powerful than
your own.<br><br>In the case of Viaweb, the simple solution was to make the software
run on the server.  The overlooked problem was to generate web sites
automatically; in 1995, online stores were all made by hand by human
designers, but we knew this wouldn&apos;t scale.  The part that actually
mattered was graphic design, not transaction processing.
The informal delivery mechanism was me, showing up in jeans and a
t-shirt at some retailer&apos;s office.  And the crude version 1 was,
if I remember correctly, less than 10,000 lines of code when we
launched.<br><br>The power of this technique extends beyond startups and programming
languages and essays.  It probably extends to any kind of creative
work.  Certainly it can be used in painting: this is exactly 
what Cezanne and Klee did.<br><br>At Y Combinator we bet money on it, in the sense that we encourage
the startups we fund to work this way. There are always new ideas
right under your nose.  So look for simple things that other people
have overlooked&#x2014;things people will later claim were 
&quot;obvious&quot;&#x2014;especially when they&apos;ve been led astray by obsolete 
conventions,
or by trying to do things that are superficially impressive.  Figure
out what the real problem is, and make sure you solve that.  Don&apos;t
worry about trying to look corporate; the product is what wins in
the long term.  And launch as soon as you can, so you start learning
from users what you should have been making.<br><br><a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> is a classic example of 
this approach.  When Reddit first
launched, it seemed like there was nothing to it.  To the graphically
unsophisticated its deliberately minimal design seemed like no
design at all.  But Reddit solved the real problem, which was to
tell people what was new and otherwise stay out of the way.  As a
result it became massively successful.  Now that conventional ideas
have caught up with it, it seems obvious.  People look at Reddit
and think the founders were lucky.  Like all such things, it was
harder than it looked.  The Reddits pushed so hard against the
current that they reversed it; now it looks like they&apos;re merely
floating downstream.<br><br>So when you look at something like Reddit and think &quot;I wish I could
think of an idea like that,&quot; remember: ideas like that are all
around you.  But you ignore them because they look wrong.<br><br><br clear="all"></xa></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="trolls">Trolls</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">February 2008<br><br>A user on Hacker News recently posted a
<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=116938">comment</a>
that set me thinking:
<blockquote>
  Something about hacker culture that never really set well with
  me was this&#x2014;the nastiness. ... I just don&apos;t understand why people
  troll like they do.
</blockquote>
I&apos;ve thought a lot over the last couple years about the problem of
trolls.  It&apos;s an old one, as old as forums, but
we&apos;re still just learning what the causes are and how to address
them.<br><br>There are two senses of the word &quot;troll.&quot;  In the original sense
it meant someone, usually an outsider, who deliberately stirred up
fights in a forum by saying controversial things.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
For example,
someone who didn&apos;t use a certain programming language might go to
a forum for users of that language and make disparaging remarks
about it, then sit back and watch as people rose to the bait.  This
sort of trolling was in the nature of a practical joke, like letting
a bat loose in a room full of people.<br><br>The definition then spread to people who behaved like assholes in
forums, whether intentionally or not.  Now when people talk about
trolls they usually mean this broader sense of the word.  Though
in a sense this is historically inaccurate, it is in other ways
more accurate, because when someone is being an asshole it&apos;s usually
uncertain even in their own mind how much is deliberate.
That is arguably one of the defining qualities of an asshole.<br><br>I think trolling in the broader sense has four causes.  The most
important is distance.  People will say things in anonymous forums
that they&apos;d never dare say to someone&apos;s face, just as they&apos;ll do
things in cars that they&apos;d never do as pedestrians&#x2014;like tailgate
people, or honk at them, or cut them off.<br><br>Trolling tends to be particularly bad in forums related to computers,
and I think that&apos;s due to the kind of people you find there.  Most
of them (myself included) are more comfortable dealing with abstract
ideas than with people.  Hackers can be abrupt even in person.  Put
them on an anonymous forum, and the problem gets worse.<br><br>The third cause of trolling is incompetence.  If you disagree with
something, it&apos;s easier to say &quot;you suck&quot; than to figure out and
explain exactly what you disagree with.  You&apos;re also safe that way
from refutation.  In this respect trolling is a lot like graffiti.
Graffiti happens at the intersection of ambition and incompetence:
people want to make their mark on the world, but have no other way
to do it than literally making a mark on the world.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The final contributing factor is the culture of the forum.  Trolls
are like children (many <i>are</i> children) in that they&apos;re capable of
a wide range of behavior depending on what they think will be
tolerated.  In a place where rudeness isn&apos;t tolerated, most can be
polite.  But vice versa as well.<br><br>There&apos;s a sort of Gresham&apos;s Law of trolls: trolls are willing to
use a forum with a lot of thoughtful people in it, but thoughtful
people aren&apos;t willing to use a forum with a lot of trolls in it.
Which means that once trolling takes hold, it tends to become the
dominant culture.  That had already happened to Slashdot and Digg by
the time I paid attention to comment threads there, but I watched
it happen to Reddit.<br><br><xa href="http://news.ycombinator.com">News.YC is, among other things, an experiment to see if this fate
can be avoided.  The sites&apos;s <a href="http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html">guidelines</a>
explicitly ask people not to say things they wouldn&apos;t say face to
face.  If someone starts being rude, other users will step in and
tell them to stop.  And when people seem to be deliberately trolling,
we ban them ruthlessly.<br><br>Technical tweaks may also help.  On Reddit, votes on your comments
don&apos;t affect your karma score, but they do on News.YC.  And it does
seem to influence people when they can see their reputation in the
eyes of their peers drain away after making an asshole remark.
Often users have second thoughts and delete such comments.<br><br>One might worry this would prevent people from expressing controversial
ideas, but empirically that doesn&apos;t seem to be what happens.  When
people say something substantial that gets modded down, they
stubbornly leave it up.  What people delete are wisecracks, because
they have less invested in them.<br><br>So far the experiment seems to be working.  The level of conversation
on News.YC is as high as on any forum I&apos;ve seen.  But we still only
have about 8,000 uniques a day.  The conversations on Reddit were
good when it was that small.  The challenge is whether we can keep
things this way.<br><br>I&apos;m optimistic we will.  We&apos;re not depending just on technical
tricks.  The core users of News.YC are mostly refugees from other
sites that were overrun by trolls.  They feel about trolls roughly
the way refugees from Cuba or Eastern Europe feel about dictatorships.
So there are a lot of people working to keep this from happening
again.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

out what we do.  Even though Y Combinator is now 3 years old, we&apos;re still
trying to understand its implications.)</i><br><br>
I was annoyed recently to read a description of Y Combinator that
said &quot;Y Combinator does seed funding for startups.&quot;  What was
especially annoying about it was that I wrote it.  This doesn&apos;t
really convey what we do.  And the reason it&apos;s inaccurate is that,
paradoxically, funding very early stage startups is not mainly about
funding.<br><br>Saying YC does seed funding for startups is a description in terms
of earlier models.  It&apos;s like calling a car a horseless carriage.<br><br>When you scale animals you can&apos;t just keep everything in proportion.
For example, volume grows as the cube of linear dimension, but
surface area only as the square.  So as animals get bigger they
have trouble radiating heat.  That&apos;s why mice and rabbits are furry
and elephants and hippos aren&apos;t.  You can&apos;t make a mouse by scaling
down an elephant.<br><br>YC represents a new, smaller kind of animal&#x2014;so much smaller
that all the rules are different.<br><br>Before us, most companies in the startup funding business were
venture capital funds.  VCs generally fund later stage companies
than we do.  And they supply so much money that, even though the
other things they do may be very valuable, it&apos;s not that inaccurate
to regard VCs as sources of money.  Good VCs are &quot;smart money,&quot; but
they&apos;re still money.<br><br>All good investors supply a combination of money and help.  But
these scale differently, just as volume and surface area do.  Late
stage investors supply huge amounts of money and
comparatively little help: when a company about to go public gets
a mezzanine round of $50 million, the deal tends to be almost
entirely about money.  As you move earlier in the venture
funding process, the ratio of help to money increases, because
earlier stage companies have different needs.  Early stage companies
need less money because they&apos;re smaller and cheaper to run, but
they need more help because life is so precarious for them.  So
when VCs do a series A round for, say, $2 million, they generally
expect to offer a significant amount of help along with the money.<br><br>Y Combinator occupies the earliest end of the spectrum.  We&apos;re at
least one and generally two steps before VC funding.  (Though some
startups go straight from YC to VC, the most common trajectory is
to do an angel round first.)  And what happens at Y Combinator is
as different from what happens in a series A round as a series A
round is from a mezzanine financing.<br><br>At our end, money is almost a negligible factor.  The startup usually
consists of just the founders. Their living expenses are the
company&apos;s main expense, and since most founders are under 30, their
living expenses are low.  But at this early stage companies need a
lot of help.  Practically every question is still unanswered.  Some
companies we&apos;ve funded have been working on their software for a
year or more, but others haven&apos;t decided what to work on, or even
who the founders should be.<br><br>When PR people and journalists recount the histories of startups
after they&apos;ve become big, they always underestimate how uncertain
things were at first.  They&apos;re not being deliberately misleading.
When you look at a company like Google, it&apos;s hard to imagine they
could once have been small and helpless.  Sure, at one point they
were a just a couple guys in a garage&#x2014;but even then their
greatness was assured, and all they had to do was roll forward along
the railroad tracks of destiny.<br><br>Far from it.  A lot of startups with just as promising beginnings
end up failing.  Google has such momentum now that it would be hard
for anyone to stop them.  But all it would have taken in the beginning
would have been for two Google employees to focus on the wrong
things for six months, and the company could have died.<br><br>We know, because we&apos;ve been there, just how vulnerable startups are
in the earliest phases.  Curiously enough, that&apos;s why founders tend
to get so rich from them.  Reward is always proportionate to risk,
and very early stage startups are insanely risky.<br><br>What we really do at Y Combinator is get startups launched straight.
One of many metaphors you could use for YC is a steam catapult on
an aircraft carrier.  We get startups airborne.  Barely airborne,
but enough that they can accelerate fast.<br><br>When you&apos;re launching planes they have to be set up properly or
you&apos;re just launching projectiles.  They have to be pointed straight
down the deck; the wings have to be trimmed properly; the engines
have to be at full power; the pilot has to be ready.  These are the
kind of problems we deal with.  After we fund startups we work
closely with them for three months&#x2014;so closely in fact that
we insist they move to where we are.  And what we do in those three
months is make sure everything is set up for launch.  If there are
tensions between cofounders we help sort them out.  We get all the
paperwork set up properly so there are no nasty surprises later.
If the founders aren&apos;t sure what to focus on first, we try to figure
that out.  If there is some obstacle right in front of them, we
either try to remove it, or shift the startup sideways.  The goal
is to get every distraction out of the way so the founders can use
that time to build (or finish building) something impressive.  And
then near the end of the three months we push the button on the
steam catapult in the form of Demo Day, where the current group of
startups present to pretty much every investor in Silicon Valley.<br><br>Launching companies isn&apos;t identical with launching products.  Though
we do spend a lot of time on launch strategies for products, there
are some things that take too long to build for a startup to launch
them before raising their next round of funding.  Several of the
most promising startups we&apos;ve funded haven&apos;t launched their products
yet, but are definitely launched as companies.<br><br>In the earliest stage, startups not only have more questions to
answer, but they tend to be different kinds of questions.  In later
stage startups the questions are about deals, or hiring, or
organization.  In the earliest phase they tend to be about technology
and design.  What do you make?  That&apos;s the first problem to solve.
That&apos;s why our motto is &quot;Make something people want.&quot;  This is
always a good thing for companies to do, but it&apos;s even more important
early on, because it sets the bounds for every other question.  Who
you hire, how much money you raise, how you market yourself&#x2014;they
all depend on what you&apos;re making.<br><br>Because the early problems are so much about technology and design,
you probably need to be hackers to do what we do.  While some VCs
have technical backgrounds, I don&apos;t know any who still write code.
Their expertise is mostly in business&#x2014;as it should be, because
that&apos;s the kind of expertise you need in the phase between series
A and (if you&apos;re lucky) IPO.<br><br>We&apos;re so different from VCs that we&apos;re really a different kind of
animal.  Can we claim founders are better off as a result of this
new type of venture firm?  I&apos;m pretty sure the answer is yes, because
YC is an improved version of what happened to our startup, and our
case was not atypical.  We started Viaweb with $10,000 in seed money
from our friend Julian.  He was a lawyer and arranged all our
paperwork, so we could just code.  We spent three months building
a version 1, which we then presented to investors to raise more
money.  Sounds familiar, doesn&apos;t it?  But YC improves on that
significantly.  Julian knew a lot about law and business, but his
advice ended there; he was not a startup guy.  So we made some basic
mistakes early on.  And when we presented to investors, we presented
to only 2, because that was all we knew.  If we&apos;d had our later
selves to encourage and advise us, and Demo Day to present at, we
would have been in much better shape.  We probably could have raised
money at 3 to 5 times the valuation we did.<br><br>If we take 7% of a company we fund, the founders only have to do
<a href="equity.html">7.5%</a> better in their next round of funding
to end up net ahead.  We certainly manage that.<br><br>So who is our 7% coming out of?  If the founders end up net ahead
it&apos;s not coming out of them.  So is it coming out of later stage
investors?  Well, they do end up paying more.  But I think they pay
more because the company is actually more valuable.  And later stage
investors have no problem with that.  The returns of a VC fund
depend on the quality of the companies they invest in, not how
cheaply they can buy stock in them.<br><br>If what we do is useful, why wasn&apos;t anyone doing it before?  There
are two answers to that.  One is that people were doing it before,
just haphazardly on a smaller scale.  Before us, seed funding came
primarily from individual angel investors.  Larry and Sergey, for
example, got their seed funding from Andy Bechtolsheim, one of the
founders of Sun.  And because he was a startup guy he probably gave
them useful advice.  But raising money from angel investors is a
hit or miss thing.  It&apos;s a sideline for most of them, so they only
do a handful of deals a year and they don&apos;t spend a lot of time on
the startups they invest in.  And they&apos;re hard to reach, because
they don&apos;t want random startups pestering them with business plans.
The Google guys were lucky because they knew someone who knew
Bechtolsheim.  It generally takes a personal introduction with
angels.<br><br>The other reason no one was doing quite what we do is that till
recently it was a lot more expensive to start a startup.  You&apos;ll
notice we haven&apos;t funded any biotech startups.  That&apos;s still
expensive.  But advancing technology has made web startups so cheap
that you really can get a company airborne for $15,000.  If you
understand how to operate a steam catapult, at least.<br><br>So in effect what&apos;s happened is that a new ecological niche has
opened up, and Y Combinator is the new kind of animal that has moved
into it.  We&apos;re not a replacement for venture capital funds.  We
occupy a new, adjacent niche.  And conditions in our niche are
really quite different.  It&apos;s not just that the problems we face
are different; the whole structure of the business is different.
VCs are playing a zero-sum game.  They&apos;re all competing for a slice
of a fixed amount of &quot;deal flow,&quot; and that explains a lot of their
behavior.  Whereas our m.o. is to create new deal flow, by encouraging
hackers who would have gotten jobs to start their own startups
instead.  We compete more with employers than VCs.<br><br>It&apos;s not surprising something like this would happen.  Most fields
become more specialized&#x2014;more articulated&#x2014;as they develop,
and startups are certainly an area in which there has been a lot
of development over the past couple decades.  The venture business
in its present form is only about forty years old.  It stands to
reason it would evolve.<br><br>And it&apos;s natural that the new niche would at first be described,
even by its inhabitants, in terms of the old one.  But really Y
Combinator is not in the startup funding business.  Really we&apos;re
more of a small, furry steam catapult.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris

March 2008, rev. June 2008<br><br>Technology tends to separate normal from natural.  Our bodies
weren&apos;t designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, or
to get so little exercise.  
There may be a similar problem with the way we work: 
a normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour
or sugar is for us physically.<br><br>I began to suspect this after spending several years working 
with startup founders.  I&apos;ve now worked with over 200 of them, and I&apos;ve
noticed a definite difference between programmers working on their
own startups and those working for large organizations.
I wouldn&apos;t say founders seem happier, necessarily;
starting a startup can be very stressful. Maybe the best way to put
it is to say that they&apos;re happier in the sense that your body is
happier during a long run than sitting on a sofa eating
doughnuts.<br><br>Though they&apos;re statistically abnormal, startup founders seem to be
working in a way that&apos;s more natural for humans.<br><br>I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild that
I&apos;d only seen in zoos before. It was remarkable how different they
seemed. Particularly lions. Lions in the wild seem about ten times
more alive. They&apos;re like different animals. I suspect that working
for oneself feels better to humans in much the same way that living
in the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion.
Life in a zoo is easier, but it isn&apos;t the life they were designed
for.<br><br>
<b>Trees</b><br><br>What&apos;s so unnatural about working for a big company?  The root of
the problem is that humans weren&apos;t meant to work in such large
groups.<br><br>Another thing you notice when you see animals in the wild is that
each species thrives in groups of a certain size.  A herd of impalas
might have 100 adults; baboons maybe 20; lions rarely 10.  Humans
also seem designed to work in groups, and what I&apos;ve read about
hunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my own
experience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8
work well; by 20 they&apos;re getting hard to manage; and a group of 50
is really unwieldy.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>
Whatever the upper limit is, we are clearly not meant to work in
groups of several hundred.  And yet&#x2014;for reasons having more
to do with technology than human nature&#x2014;a great many people
work for companies with hundreds or thousands of employees.<br><br>Companies know groups that large wouldn&apos;t work, so they divide
themselves into units small enough to work together.  But to
coordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.<br><br>These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure.  Your
boss is the point where your group attaches to the tree.  But when
you use this trick for dividing a large group into smaller ones,
something strange happens that I&apos;ve never heard anyone mention
explicitly.  In the group one level up from yours, your boss
represents your entire group.  A group of 10 managers is not merely
a group of 10 people working together in the usual way.  It&apos;s really
a group of groups.  Which means for a group of 10 managers to work
together as if they were simply a group of 10 individuals, the group
working for each manager would have to work as if they were a single
person&#x2014;the workers and manager would each share only one
person&apos;s worth of freedom between them.<br><br>In practice a group of people are never able to act as if they were
one person.  But in a large organization divided into groups in
this way, the pressure is always in that direction.  Each group
tries its best to work as if it were the small group of individuals
that humans were designed to work in.  That was the point of creating
it.  And when you propagate that constraint, the result is that
each person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the
size of the entire tree.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Anyone who&apos;s worked for a large organization has felt this.  You
can feel the difference between working for a company with 100
employees and one with 10,000, even if your group has only 10 people.<br><br>
<b>Corn Syrup</b><br><br>A group of 10 people within a large organization is a kind of fake
tribe.  The number of people you interact with is about right.  But
something is missing: individual initiative.  Tribes of hunter-gatherers
have much more freedom.  The leaders have a little more power than other
members of the tribe, but they don&apos;t generally tell them what to
do and when the way a boss can.<br><br>It&apos;s not your boss&apos;s fault.  The real problem is that in the group
above you in the hierarchy, your entire group is one virtual person.
Your boss is just the way that constraint is imparted to you.<br><br>So working in a group of 10 people within a large organization feels
both right and wrong at the same time.   On the surface it feels
like the kind of group you&apos;re meant to work in, but something major
is missing.  A job at a big company is like high fructose corn
syrup: it has some of the qualities of things you&apos;re meant to like,
but is disastrously lacking in others.<br><br>Indeed, food is an excellent metaphor to explain what&apos;s wrong with
the usual sort of job.<br><br>For example, working for a big company is the default thing to do,
at least for programmers.  How bad could it be?  Well, food shows
that pretty clearly.  If you were dropped at a random point in
America today, nearly all the food around you would be bad for you.
Humans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high
fructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil.  And yet if
you analyzed the contents of the average grocery store you&apos;d probably
find these four ingredients accounted for most of the calories.
&quot;Normal&quot; food is terribly bad for you.  The only people who eat
what humans were actually designed to eat are a few Birkenstock-wearing
weirdos in Berkeley.<br><br>If &quot;normal&quot; food is so bad for us, why is it so common?  There are
two main reasons. One is that it has more immediate appeal.  You
may feel lousy an hour after eating that pizza, but eating the first
couple bites feels great.  The other is economies of scale.
Producing junk food scales; producing fresh vegetables doesn&apos;t.
Which means (a) junk food can be very cheap, and (b) it&apos;s worth
spending a lot to market it.<br><br>If people have to choose between something that&apos;s cheap, heavily
marketed, and appealing in the short term, and something that&apos;s
expensive, obscure, and appealing in the long term, which do you
think most will choose?<br><br>It&apos;s the same with work.  The average MIT graduate wants to work
at Google or Microsoft, because it&apos;s a recognized brand, it&apos;s safe,
and they&apos;ll get paid a good salary right away.  It&apos;s the job
equivalent of the pizza they had for lunch.  The drawbacks will
only become apparent later, and then only in a vague sense of
malaise.<br><br>And founders and early employees of startups, meanwhile, are like
the Birkenstock-wearing weirdos of Berkeley:  though a tiny minority
of the population, they&apos;re the ones living as humans are meant to.
In an artificial world, only extremists live naturally.<br><br>
<b>Programmers</b><br><br>The restrictiveness of big company jobs is particularly hard on
programmers, because the essence of programming is to build new
things.  Sales people make much the same pitches every day; support
people answer much the same questions; but once you&apos;ve written a
piece of code you don&apos;t need to write it again.  So a programmer
working as programmers are meant to is always making new things.
And when you&apos;re part of an organization whose structure gives each
person freedom in inverse proportion to the size of the tree, you&apos;re
going to face resistance when you do something new.<br><br>This seems an inevitable consequence of bigness.  It&apos;s true even
in the smartest companies.  I was talking recently to a founder who
considered starting a startup right out of college, but went to
work for Google instead because he thought he&apos;d learn more there.
He didn&apos;t learn as much as he expected.  Programmers learn by doing,
and most of the things he wanted to do, he couldn&apos;t&#x2014;sometimes
because the company wouldn&apos;t let him, but often because the company&apos;s
code wouldn&apos;t let him.  Between the drag of legacy code, the overhead
of doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictions
imposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try a
fraction of the things he would have liked to.  He said he has
learned much more in his own startup, despite the fact that he has
to do all the company&apos;s errands as well as programming, because at
least when he&apos;s programming he can do whatever he wants.<br><br>An obstacle downstream propagates upstream.  If you&apos;re not allowed
to implement new ideas, you stop having them.  And vice versa: when
you can do whatever you want, you have more ideas about what to do.
So working for yourself makes your brain more powerful in the same
way a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.<br><br>Working for yourself doesn&apos;t have to mean starting a startup, of
course.  But a programmer deciding between a regular job at a big
company and their own startup is probably going to learn more doing
the startup.<br><br>You can adjust the amount of freedom you get by scaling the size
of company you work for.  If you start the company, you&apos;ll have the
most freedom.  If you become one of the first 10 employees you&apos;ll
have almost as much freedom as the founders.  Even a company with
100 people will feel different from one with 1000.<br><br>Working for a small company doesn&apos;t ensure freedom.  The tree
structure of large organizations sets an upper bound on freedom,
not a lower bound.  The head of a small company may still choose
to be a tyrant.  The point is that a large organization is compelled
by its structure to be one.<br><br>
<b>Consequences</b><br><br>That has real consequences for both organizations and individuals.
One is that companies will inevitably slow down as they grow larger,
no matter how hard they try to keep their startup mojo.  It&apos;s a
consequence of the tree structure that every large organization is
forced to adopt.<br><br>Or rather, a large organization could only avoid slowing down if
they avoided tree structure.  And since human nature limits the
size of group that can work together, the only way I can imagine
for larger groups to avoid tree structure would be to have no
structure: to have each group actually be independent, and to work
together the way components of a market economy do.<br><br>That might be worth exploring.  I suspect there are already some
highly partitionable businesses that lean this way.  But I don&apos;t
know any technology companies that have done it.<br><br>There is one thing companies can do short of structuring themselves
as sponges:  they can stay small.  If I&apos;m right, then it really
pays to keep a company as small as it can be at every stage.
Particularly a technology company.  Which means it&apos;s doubly important
to hire the best people.  Mediocre hires hurt you twice: they get
less done, but they also make you big, because you need more of
them to solve a given problem.<br><br>For individuals the upshot is the same: aim small.  It will always
suck to work for large organizations, and the larger the organization,
the more it will suck.<br><br>In an <a href="start.html">essay</a> I wrote a couple years ago 
I advised graduating seniors
to work for a couple years for another company before starting their
own.  I&apos;d modify that now.  Work for another company if you want
to, but only for a small one, and if you want to start your own
startup, go ahead.<br><br>The reason I suggested college graduates not start startups immediately
was that I felt most would fail.  And they will.  But ambitious
programmers are better off doing their own thing and failing than
going to work at a big company.  Certainly they&apos;ll learn more.  They
might even be better off financially.  A lot of people in their
early twenties get into debt, because their expenses grow even
faster than the salary that seemed so high when they left school.
At least if you start a startup and fail your net worth will be
zero rather than negative.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>We&apos;ve now funded so many different types of founders that we have
enough data to see patterns, and there seems to be no benefit from
working for a big company.  The people who&apos;ve worked for a few years
do seem better than the ones straight out of college, but only
because they&apos;re that much older.<br><br>The people who come to us from big companies often seem kind of
conservative.  It&apos;s hard to say how much is because big companies
made them that way, and how much is the natural conservatism that
made them work for the big companies in the first place.  But
certainly a large part of it is learned.  I know because I&apos;ve seen
it burn off.<br><br>Having seen that happen so many times is one of the things that
convinces me that working for oneself, or at least for a small
group, is the natural way for programmers to live.  Founders arriving
at Y Combinator often have the downtrodden air of refugees.  Three
months later they&apos;re transformed: they have so much more 
<a href="http://paulmckellar.com/photos/03l">confidence</a>
that they seem as if they&apos;ve grown several inches taller. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
Strange as this sounds, they seem both more worried and happier at the same
time.  Which is exactly how I&apos;d describe the way lions seem in the
wild.<br><br>Watching employees get transformed into founders makes it clear
that the difference between the two is due mostly to environment&#x2014;and
in particular that the environment in big companies is toxic to
programmers.   In the first couple weeks of working on their own
startup they seem to come to life, because finally they&apos;re working
the way people are meant to.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]

Twenty years ago,
writers wrote and readers read.  The web lets readers respond, and
increasingly they do&#x2014;in comment threads, on forums, and in their
own blog posts.<br><br>Many who respond to something disagree with it.  That&apos;s to be
expected.  Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing.
And when you agree there&apos;s less to say.  You could expand on something
the author said, but he has probably already explored the
most interesting implications.  When you disagree you&apos;re entering
territory he may not have explored.<br><br>The result is there&apos;s a lot more disagreeing going on, especially
measured by the word.  That doesn&apos;t mean people are getting angrier.
The structural change in the way we communicate is enough to account
for it.  But though it&apos;s not anger that&apos;s driving the increase in
disagreement, there&apos;s a danger that the increase in disagreement
will make people angrier.  Particularly online, where it&apos;s easy to
say things you&apos;d never say face to face.<br><br>If we&apos;re all going to be disagreeing more, we should be careful to
do it well.  What does it mean to disagree well?   Most readers can
tell the difference between mere name-calling and a carefully
reasoned refutation, but I think it would help to put names on the
intermediate stages.  So here&apos;s an attempt at a disagreement
hierarchy:<br><br>
<b>DH0. Name-calling.</b><br><br>This is the lowest form of disagreement, and probably also the most
common.  We&apos;ve all seen comments like this:
<blockquote>
  u r a fag!!!!!!!!!!
</blockquote>
But it&apos;s important to realize that more articulate name-calling has
just as little weight.  A comment like
<blockquote>
  The author is a self-important dilettante.
</blockquote>
is really nothing more than a pretentious version of &quot;u r a fag.&quot;<br><br>
<b>DH1. Ad Hominem.</b><br><br>An ad hominem attack is not quite as weak as mere name-calling.  It
might actually carry some weight.  For example, if a senator wrote
an article saying senators&apos; salaries should be increased, one could
respond:
<blockquote>
  Of course he would say that.  He&apos;s a senator.
</blockquote>
This wouldn&apos;t refute the author&apos;s argument, but it may at least be
relevant to the case.  It&apos;s still a very weak form of disagreement,
though.  If there&apos;s something wrong with the senator&apos;s argument,
you should say what it is; and if there isn&apos;t, what difference does
it make that he&apos;s a senator?<br><br>Saying that an author lacks the authority to write about a topic
is a variant of ad hominem&#x2014;and a particularly useless sort, because
good ideas often come from outsiders.  The question is whether the
author is correct or not.  If his lack of authority caused him to
make mistakes, point those out.  And if it didn&apos;t, it&apos;s not a
problem.<br><br>
<b>DH2. Responding to Tone.</b><br><br>The next level up we start to see responses to the writing, rather
than the writer.  The lowest form of these is to disagree with the
author&apos;s tone.  E.g.
<blockquote>
  I can&apos;t believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such
  a cavalier fashion.
</blockquote>
Though better than attacking the author, this is still a weak form
of disagreement.  It matters much more whether the author is wrong
or right than what his tone is.  Especially since tone is so hard
to judge.  Someone who has a chip on their shoulder about some topic
might be offended by a tone that to other readers seemed neutral.<br><br>So if the worst thing you can say about something is to criticize
its tone, you&apos;re not saying much.  Is the author flippant, but
correct?  Better that than grave and wrong.  And if the author is
incorrect somewhere, say where.<br><br><b>DH3. Contradiction.</b><br><br>In this stage we finally get responses to what was said, rather
than how or by whom.  The lowest form of response to an argument
is simply to state the opposing case, with little or no supporting
evidence.<br><br>This is often combined with DH2 statements, as in:
<blockquote>
  I can&apos;t believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such
  a cavalier fashion.  Intelligent design is a legitimate scientific
  theory.
</blockquote>
Contradiction can sometimes have some weight.  Sometimes merely
seeing the opposing case stated explicitly is enough to see that
it&apos;s right.  But usually evidence will help.<br><br><b>DH4. Counterargument.</b><br><br>At level 4 we reach the first form of convincing disagreement:
counterargument.  Forms up to this point can usually be ignored as
proving nothing.  Counterargument might prove something.  The problem
is, it&apos;s hard to say exactly what.<br><br>Counterargument is contradiction plus reasoning and/or evidence.
When aimed squarely at the original argument, it can be convincing.
But unfortunately it&apos;s common for counterarguments to be aimed at
something slightly different.  More often than not, two people
arguing passionately about something are actually arguing about two
different things.  Sometimes they even agree with one another, but
are so caught up in their squabble they don&apos;t realize it.<br><br>There could be a legitimate reason for arguing against something
slightly different from what the original author said: when you
feel they missed the heart of the matter.  But when you do that,
you should say explicitly you&apos;re doing it.<br><br><b>DH5. Refutation.</b><br><br>The most convincing form of disagreement is refutation.  It&apos;s also
the rarest, because it&apos;s the most work.  Indeed, the disagreement
hierarchy forms a kind of pyramid, in the sense that the higher you
go the fewer instances you find.<br><br>To refute someone you probably have to quote them.  You have to
find a &quot;smoking gun,&quot; a passage in whatever you disagree with that
you feel is mistaken, and then explain why it&apos;s mistaken.  If you
can&apos;t find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguing
with a straw man.<br><br>While refutation generally entails quoting, quoting doesn&apos;t necessarily
imply refutation.  Some writers quote parts of things they disagree
with to give the appearance of legitimate refutation, then follow
with a response as low as DH3 or even DH0.<br><br><b>DH6. Refuting the Central Point.</b><br><br>The force of a refutation depends on what you refute.  The most
powerful form of disagreement is to refute someone&apos;s central point.<br><br>Even as high as DH5 we still sometimes see deliberate dishonesty,
as when someone picks out minor points of an argument and refutes
those.  Sometimes the spirit in which this is done makes it more
of a sophisticated form of ad hominem than actual refutation.  For
example, correcting someone&apos;s grammar, or harping on minor mistakes
in names or numbers.  Unless the opposing argument actually depends
on such things, the only purpose of correcting them is to
discredit one&apos;s opponent.<br><br>Truly refuting something requires one to refute its central point,
or at least one of them.  And that means one has to commit explicitly
to what the central point is.  So a truly effective refutation would
look like:
<blockquote>
  The author&apos;s main point seems to be x.  As he says:
<blockquote>
    &lt;quotation&gt;
</blockquote>
  But this is wrong for the following reasons...
</blockquote>
The quotation you point out as mistaken need not be the actual
statement of the author&apos;s main point.  It&apos;s enough to refute something
it depends upon.<br><br>
<b>What It Means</b><br><br>Now we have a way of classifying forms of disagreement.  What good
is it?  One thing the disagreement hierarchy <i>doesn&apos;t</i> give us is
a way of picking a winner.  DH levels merely describe the form of
a statement, not whether it&apos;s correct.  A DH6 response could still
be completely mistaken.<br><br>But while DH levels don&apos;t set a lower bound on the convincingness
of a reply, they do set an upper bound.  A DH6 response might be
unconvincing, but a DH2 or lower response is always unconvincing.<br><br>The most obvious advantage of classifying the forms of disagreement
is that it will help people to evaluate what they read.  In particular,
it will help them to see through intellectually dishonest arguments.
An eloquent speaker or writer can give the impression of vanquishing
an opponent merely by using forceful words.  In fact that is probably
the defining quality of a demagogue.  By giving names to the different
forms of disagreement, we give critical readers a pin for popping
such balloons.<br><br>Such labels may help writers too.  Most intellectual dishonesty is
unintentional.  Someone arguing against the tone of something he
disagrees with may believe he&apos;s really saying something.  Zooming
out and seeing his current position on the disagreement hierarchy
may inspire him to try moving up to counterargument or refutation.<br><br>But the greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that it
will make conversations better, but that it will make the people
who have them happier.  If you study conversations, you find there
is a lot more meanness down in DH1 than up in DH6.  You don&apos;t have
to be mean when you have a real point to make.  In fact, you don&apos;t
want to.  If you have something real to say, being mean just gets
in the way.<br><br>If moving up the disagreement hierarchy makes people less mean,
that will make most of them happier.  Most people don&apos;t really enjoy
being mean; they do it because they can&apos;t help it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

write about.  This is one of them: a list of my heroes.<br><br>I&apos;m not claiming this is a list of the <i>n</i> most admirable people.
Who could make such a list, even if they wanted to?<br><br>Einstein isn&apos;t on the list, for example, even though he probably
deserves to be on any shortlist of admirable people.  I once asked
a physicist friend if Einstein was really as smart as his fame
implies, and she said that yes, he was.  So why isn&apos;t he on the
list?  Because I had to ask.  This is a list of people who&apos;ve
influenced me, not people who would have if I understood their work.<br><br>My test was to think of someone and ask &quot;is this person my
hero?&quot;  It often returned surprising answers.  For example,
it returned false for Montaigne, who was arguably the inventor of
the essay.  Why?  When I thought
about what it meant to call someone a hero, it meant I&apos;d decide what
to do by asking what they&apos;d do in the same situation.  That&apos;s a 
stricter standard than admiration.<br><br>After I made the list, I looked to see if there was a pattern, and
there was, a very clear one.  Everyone on the list had two qualities:
they cared almost excessively about their work, and they were
absolutely honest.  By honest I don&apos;t mean trustworthy so much as
that they never pander: they never say or do something because
that&apos;s what the audience wants.  They are all fundamentally subversive
for this reason, though they conceal it to varying degrees.<br><br>
<b>Jack Lambert</b><br><br>I grew up in Pittsburgh in the 1970s.  Unless you were there it&apos;s
hard to imagine how that town felt about the Steelers.   Locally,
all the news was bad.  The steel industry was dying.  But the
Steelers were the best team in football&#x2014;and moreover, in a
way that seemed to reflect the personality of the city.  They didn&apos;t
do anything fancy.  They just got the job done.<br><br>Other players were more famous: Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, Lynn
Swann.  But they played offense, and you always get more attention
for that.  It seemed to me as a twelve year old football expert
that the best of them all was 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Lambert_(American_football_player)">Jack Lambert</a>.  And what made him so
good was that he was utterly relentless.  He didn&apos;t just care about
playing well; he cared almost too much.  He seemed to regard it as
a personal insult when someone from the other team had possession
of the ball on his side of the line of scrimmage.<br><br>The suburbs of Pittsburgh in the 1970s were a pretty dull place.
School was boring.  All the adults around were bored with their
jobs working for big companies. Everything that came to us through
the mass media was (a) blandly uniform and (b) produced elsewhere.
Jack Lambert was the exception.  He was like nothing else I&apos;d seen.<br><br>
<b>Kenneth Clark</b><br><br>Kenneth Clark is the best nonfiction writer I know of, on any
subject.  Most people who write about art history don&apos;t really like
art; you can tell from a thousand little signs.  But Clark did, and
not just intellectually, but the way one anticipates a delicious
dinner.<br><br>What really makes him stand out, though, is the quality of his
ideas.  His style is deceptively casual, but there is more in 
his books than in a library
of art monographs.  Reading 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nude-Study-Ideal-Form/dp/0691017883"><i>The Nude</i></a> is like a ride in a
Ferrari.  Just as you&apos;re getting settled, you&apos;re slammed back in
your seat by the acceleration.  Before you can adjust, you&apos;re thrown
sideways as the car screeches into the first turn.  His brain throws
off ideas almost too fast to grasp them.  Finally at the end of the
chapter you come to a halt, with your eyes wide and a big smile on
your face.<br><br>Kenneth Clark was a star in his day, thanks to the documentary
series 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000F0UUKA"><i>Civilisation</i></a>.  And if you read only one book about
art history, 
<a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=clark&amp;sts=t&amp;tn=civilisation"><i>Civilisation</i></a> is the one I&apos;d recommend.  It&apos;s
much better than the drab Sears Catalogs of art that undergraduates
are forced to buy for Art History 101.<br><br>
<b>Larry Mihalko</b><br><br>A lot of people have a great teacher at some point in their childhood.
Larry Mihalko was mine.  When I look back it&apos;s like there&apos;s a line
drawn between third and fourth grade.  After Mr. Mihalko, everything
was different.<br><br>Why?  First of all, he was intellectually curious.  I had a few
other teachers who were smart, but I wouldn&apos;t describe them as
intellectually curious.  In retrospect, he was out of place as an
elementary school teacher, and I think he knew it.  That must have
been hard for him, but it was wonderful for us, his students.  His
class was a constant adventure.  I used to like going to school
every day.<br><br>The other thing that made him different was that he liked us.  Kids
are good at telling that.  The other teachers were at best benevolently
indifferent.  But Mr.  Mihalko seemed like he actually wanted to
be our friend.  On the last day of fourth grade, he got out one of
the heavy school record players and played James Taylor&apos;s &quot;You&apos;ve
Got a Friend&quot; to us.  Just call out my name, and you know wherever
I am, I&apos;ll come running.  He died at 59 of lung cancer.  I&apos;ve never
cried like I cried at his funeral.<br><br>
<b>Leonardo</b><br><br>One of the things I&apos;ve learned about making things that I didn&apos;t
realize when I was a kid is that much of the best stuff isn&apos;t made
for audiences, but for oneself.  You see paintings and drawings in
museums and imagine they were made for you to look at.  Actually a
lot of the best ones were made as a way of exploring the world, not
as a way to please other people.  The best of these explorations
are sometimes more pleasing than stuff made explicitly to please.<br><br>Leonardo did a lot of things.  One of his most admirable qualities
was that he did so many different things that were admirable.  What
people know of him now is his paintings and his more flamboyant
inventions, like flying machines.  That makes him seem like some
kind of dreamer who sketched artists&apos; conceptions of rocket ships
on the side.  In fact he made a large number of far more practical
technical discoveries.  He was as good an engineer as a painter.<br><br>His most impressive work, to me, is his 
<a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/leonardo-skull.jpg">drawings</a>.  They&apos;re clearly
made more as a way of studying the world than producing something
beautiful. And yet they can hold their own with any work of art
ever made.  No one else, before or since, was that good when no one
was looking.<br><br>
<b>Robert Morris</b><br><br>Robert Morris has a very unusual quality: he&apos;s never wrong.  It
might seem this would require you to be omniscient, but actually
it&apos;s surprisingly easy. Don&apos;t say anything unless you&apos;re fairly
sure of it.  If you&apos;re not omniscient, you just don&apos;t end up saying
much.<br><br>More precisely, the trick is to pay careful attention to how you
qualify what you say.  By using this trick, Robert has, as far as
I know, managed to be mistaken only once, and that was when he was
an undergrad.  When the Mac came out, he said that little desktop
computers would never be suitable for real hacking.<br><br>It&apos;s wrong to call it a trick in his case, though.  If it were a
conscious trick, he would have slipped in a moment of excitement.
With Robert this quality is wired-in.  He has an almost superhuman
integrity.  He&apos;s not just generally correct, but also correct about
how correct he is.<br><br>You&apos;d think it would be such a great thing never to be wrong that
everyone would do this.  It doesn&apos;t seem like that much extra work
to pay as much attention to the error on an idea as to the idea
itself.  And yet practically no one does.  I know how hard it is,
because since meeting Robert I&apos;ve tried to do in software what he
seems to do in hardware.<br><br>
<b>P. G. Wodehouse</b><br><br>People are finally starting to admit that Wodehouse was a great
writer.  If you want to be thought a great novelist in your own
time, you have to sound intellectual.  If what you write is popular,
or entertaining, or funny, you&apos;re ipso facto suspect.  That makes
Wodehouse doubly impressive, because it meant that to write as he
wanted to, he had to commit to being despised in his own lifetime.<br><br>Evelyn Waugh called him a great writer, but to most people at the
time that would have read as a chivalrous or deliberately perverse
gesture. At the time any random autobiographical novel by a recent
college grad could count on more respectful treatment from the
literary establishment.<br><br>Wodehouse may have begun with simple atoms, but the way he composed
them into molecules was near faultless.  His rhythm in particular.
It makes me self-conscious to write about it.  I can think of only
two other writers who came near him for style: Evelyn Waugh and
Nancy Mitford.  Those three used the English language like they
owned it.<br><br>But Wodehouse has something neither of them did.  He&apos;s at ease.
Evelyn Waugh and Nancy Mitford cared what other people thought of
them: he wanted to seem aristocratic; she was afraid she wasn&apos;t
smart enough.  But Wodehouse didn&apos;t give a damn what anyone thought
of him.  He wrote exactly what he wanted.<br><br>
<b>Alexander Calder</b><br><br>Calder&apos;s on this list because he makes me happy.  Can his work stand
up to Leonardo&apos;s?  Probably not.  There might not be anything from
the 20th Century that can.  But what was good about Modernism,
Calder had, and had in a way that he made seem effortless.<br><br>What was good about Modernism was its freshness.  Art became stuffy
in the nineteenth century.  The paintings that were popular at the
time were mostly the art equivalent of McMansions&#x2014;big,
pretentious, and fake.  Modernism meant starting over, making things
with the same earnest motives that children might.  The artists who
benefited most from this were the ones who had preserved a child&apos;s
confidence, like Klee and Calder.<br><br>Klee was impressive because he could work in so many different
styles.  But between the two I like Calder better, because his work
seemed happier.  Ultimately the point of art is to engage the viewer.
It&apos;s hard to predict what will; often something that seems interesting
at first will bore you after a month.  Calder&apos;s 
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/uergevich/7029234689/">sculptures</a> never
get boring.  They just sit there quietly radiating optimism, like
a battery that never runs out.  As far as I can tell from books and
photographs, the happiness of Calder&apos;s work is his own happiness
showing through.<br><br>
<b>Jane Austen</b><br><br>Everyone admires Jane Austen.  Add my name to the list.  To me she
seems the best novelist of all time.<br><br>I&apos;m interested in how things work.  When I read most novels, I pay
as much attention to the author&apos;s choices as to the story.  But in
her novels I can&apos;t see the gears at work.  Though I&apos;d really like
to know how she does what she does, I can&apos;t figure it out, because
she&apos;s so good that her stories don&apos;t seem made up.  I feel like I&apos;m
reading a description of something that actually happened.<br><br>I used to read a lot of novels when I was younger.  I can&apos;t read
most anymore, because they don&apos;t have enough information in them.
Novels seem so impoverished compared to history and biography.  But 
reading Austen is like reading
nonfiction.  She writes so well you don&apos;t even notice her.<br><br>
<b>John McCarthy</b><br><br>John McCarthy invented Lisp, the field of (or at least the term)
artificial intelligence, and was an early member of both of the top
two computer science departments, MIT and Stanford.  No one would
dispute that he&apos;s one of the greats, but he&apos;s an especial hero to
me because of 
<a href="rootsoflisp.html">Lisp</a>.<br><br>It&apos;s hard for us now to understand what a conceptual leap that was
at the time.  Paradoxically, one of the reasons his achievement is
hard to appreciate is that it was so successful.  Practically every
programming language invented in the last 20 years includes ideas
from Lisp, and each year the median language gets more Lisplike.<br><br>In 1958 these ideas were anything but obvious.  In 1958 there seem
to have been two ways of thinking about programming.  Some people
thought of it as math, and proved things about Turing Machines.
Others thought of it as a way to get things done, and designed
languages all too influenced by the technology of the day.  McCarthy
alone bridged the gap.  He designed a language that was math.  But
designed is not really the word; discovered is more like it.<br><br>
<b>The Spitfire</b><br><br>As I was making this list I found myself thinking of people like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Bader">Douglas Bader</a> 
and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._J._Mitchell">R.J. Mitchell</a>
 and 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spitfire-Pilots-Story-Crecy-Cover/dp/0947554726">Jeffrey Quill</a> and I realized
that though all of them had done many things in their lives, there
was one factor above all that connected them: the Spitfire.<br><br>This is supposed to be a list of heroes.  How can a machine be on
it?  Because that machine was not just a machine.  It was a lens
of heroes.  Extraordinary devotion went into it, and extraordinary
courage came out.<br><br>It&apos;s a cliche to call World War II a contest between good and evil,
but between fighter designs, it really was.  The Spitfire&apos;s original
nemesis, the ME 109, was a brutally practical plane.  It was a
killing machine.  The Spitfire was optimism embodied.  And not just
in its beautiful lines: it was at the edge of what could be
manufactured.  But taking the high road worked.  In the air, beauty
had the edge, just.<br><br>
<b>Steve Jobs</b><br><br>People alive when Kennedy was killed  usually remember exactly where
they were when they heard about it.  I remember exactly where I was
when a friend asked if I&apos;d heard Steve Jobs had cancer.  It was
like the floor dropped out.   A few seconds later she told me that
it was a rare operable type, and that he&apos;d be ok.  But those seconds
seemed long.<br><br>I wasn&apos;t sure whether to include Jobs on this list.  A lot of people
at Apple seem to be afraid of him, which is a bad sign.  But he
compels admiration.<br><br>There&apos;s no name for what Steve Jobs is, because there hasn&apos;t been
anyone quite like him before.  He doesn&apos;t design Apple&apos;s products
himself.  Historically the closest analogy to what he does are the
great Renaissance patrons of the arts.  As the CEO of a company,
that makes him unique.<br><br>Most CEOs delegate 
<a href="taste.html">taste</a> to a subordinate.
The 
<a href="gh.html">design paradox</a>
 means they&apos;re choosing more or less at random.  But Steve
Jobs actually has taste himself&#x2014;such good taste that he&apos;s shown
the world how much more important taste is than they realized.<br><br>
<b>Isaac Newton</b><br><br>Newton has a strange role in my pantheon of heroes: he&apos;s the one I
reproach myself with.  He worked on big things, at least for part
of his life.  It&apos;s so easy to get distracted working on small stuff.
The questions you&apos;re answering are pleasantly familiar.  You get
immediate rewards&#x2014;in fact, you get bigger rewards in your
time if you work on matters of passing importance.  But I&apos;m
uncomfortably aware that this is the route to well-deserved obscurity.<br><br>To do really great things, you have to seek out questions people
didn&apos;t even realize were questions.  There have probably been other
people who did this as well as Newton, for their time, but Newton
is my model of this kind of thought.  I can just begin to understand
what it must have felt like for him.<br><br>You only get one life.  Why not do something huge?  The phrase &quot;paradigm
shift&quot; is overused now, but Kuhn was onto something.  And you know
more are out there, separated from us by what will later seem a
surprisingly thin wall of laziness and stupidity.  If we work like
Newton.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Jackie McDonough for reading drafts of this.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.aoky.net/articles/paul_graham/heroes.htm">Japanese Translation</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="googles">Why There Aren&apos;t More Googles</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">
<p>
April 2008<br><br>Umair Haque 
<a href="http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/haque/2008/04/i_agree_and_i.html">wrote</a> recently that the reason there aren&apos;t more Googles is
that most startups get bought before they can change the world.
<blockquote>
  Google, despite serious interest from Microsoft and Yahoo&#x2014;what
  must have seemed like lucrative interest at the time&#x2014;didn&apos;t
  sell out. Google might simply have been nothing but Yahoo&apos;s or
  MSN&apos;s search box.<br><br>Why isn&apos;t it? Because Google had a deeply felt sense of purpose:
  a conviction to change the world for the better.
</blockquote>
This has a nice sound to it, but it isn&apos;t true. 
Google&apos;s founders were willing to sell early on.
They just wanted more than acquirers were willing to pay.<br><br>It was the same with Facebook.  They would have sold, but Yahoo blew it 
by offering too little.<br><br>Tip for acquirers: when a startup turns you down, consider raising
your offer, because there&apos;s a good chance the outrageous price they 
want will later seem a bargain. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>From the evidence I&apos;ve seen so far,
startups that turn down acquisition offers usually end up doing better.  
Not always, but usually there&apos;s a bigger offer coming, or
perhaps even an IPO.<br><br>Of course, the reason startups do better when they turn down
acquisition offers is not necessarily that all such offers undervalue
startups.  More likely the reason is that the kind of founders who
have the balls to turn down a big offer also tend to be very
successful.  That spirit is exactly what you want in a startup.<br><br>While I&apos;m sure Larry and Sergey do want to change the world, at
least now, the reason Google survived to become a big, independent
company is the same reason Facebook has so far remained independent:
acquirers underestimated them.<br><br>Corporate M&amp;A is a strange business in that respect.  They consistently
lose the best deals, because turning down reasonable offers is the
most reliable test you could invent for whether a startup will make
it big.<br><br><b>VCs</b><br><br>So what&apos;s the real reason there aren&apos;t more Googles?  Curiously
enough, it&apos;s the same reason Google and Facebook have remained
independent: money guys undervalue the most innovative startups.<br><br>The reason there aren&apos;t more Googles is not that investors encourage
innovative startups to sell out, but that they won&apos;t even fund them.
I&apos;ve learned a lot about VCs during the 3 years we&apos;ve been doing Y
Combinator, because we often have to work quite closely with them.
The most surprising thing I&apos;ve learned is how conservative they
are.  VC firms present an image of boldly encouraging innovation.
Only a handful actually do, and even they are more conservative in
reality than you&apos;d guess from reading their sites.<br><br>I used to think of VCs as piratical: bold but unscrupulous.  On
closer acquaintance they turn out to be more like bureaucrats.
They&apos;re more upstanding than I used to think (the good ones, at
least), but less bold.  Maybe the VC industry has changed.  Maybe
they used to be bolder.  
But I suspect it&apos;s the startup world that has
changed, not them.  The low cost of starting a startup means the
average good bet is a riskier one, but most existing VC firms still
operate as if they were investing in hardware startups in 1985.<br><br>Howard Aiken said &quot;Don&apos;t worry about people stealing your ideas.
If your ideas are any good, you&apos;ll have to ram them down people&apos;s
throats.&quot; I have a similar feeling when I&apos;m trying to convince VCs
to invest in startups Y Combinator has funded.  They&apos;re terrified
of really novel ideas, unless the founders are good enough salesmen
to compensate.<br><br>But it&apos;s the bold ideas that generate the biggest returns.  Any
really good new idea will seem bad to most people; otherwise someone
would already be doing it.  And
yet most VCs are driven by consensus, not just within their firms,
but within the VC community.  The biggest factor determining how a
VC will feel about your startup is how other VCs feel about it.  I
doubt they realize it, but this algorithm guarantees they&apos;ll miss
all the very best ideas.  The more people who have to like a new
idea, the more outliers you lose.<br><br>Whoever the next Google is, they&apos;re probably being told right now
by VCs to come back when they have more &quot;traction.&quot;<br><br>Why are VCs so conservative?  It&apos;s probably a combination of factors.
The large size of their investments makes them conservative.
Plus they&apos;re investing other people&apos;s money, which makes
them worry they&apos;ll get in trouble if they do something risky and
it fails.  Plus most of them are money guys rather than technical
guys, so they don&apos;t understand what the startups they&apos;re investing
in do.<br><br><a name="next"><b>What&apos;s Next</b></a><br><br>The exciting thing about market economies is that stupidity equals
opportunity.  And so it is in this case.  There is a huge, unexploited
opportunity in startup investing.  Y Combinator funds startups at
the very beginning.  VCs will fund them once they&apos;re already starting
to succeed.  But between the two there is a substantial gap.<br><br>There are companies that will give $20k to a startup that has nothing
more than the founders, and there are companies that will give $2
million to a startup that&apos;s already taking off,
but there aren&apos;t enough investors who will give $200k to a startup
that seems very promising but still has some things to figure out.
This territory is occupied mostly by
individual angel investors&#x2014;people like Andy Bechtolsheim, who
gave Google $100k when they seemed promising but still had some
things to figure out. I like angels, but there just aren&apos;t enough
of them, and investing is for most of them a part time job.<br><br>And yet as it gets cheaper to start startups, this sparsely occupied
territory is becoming more and more valuable.   Nowadays a lot of
startups don&apos;t want to raise multi-million dollar series A rounds.
They don&apos;t need that much money, and they don&apos;t want the hassles
that come with it.  The median startup coming out of Y Combinator
wants to raise $250-500k.  When they go to VC firms they have to
ask for more because they know VCs aren&apos;t interested in such small
deals.<br><br>VCs are money managers.  They&apos;re looking for ways to put large sums
to work.  But the startup world is evolving away from their current
model.<br><br>Startups have gotten cheaper.  That means they want less money, but
also that there are more of them.  So you can still get large returns
on large amounts of money; you just have to spread it more broadly.<br><br>I&apos;ve tried to explain this to VC firms.  Instead of making one $2
million investment, make five $400k investments.  Would that mean
sitting on too many boards?  Don&apos;t sit on their boards.  Would that
mean too much due diligence?  Do less.  If you&apos;re investing at a
tenth the valuation, you only have to be a tenth as sure.<br><br>It seems obvious.  But I&apos;ve proposed to several VC firms that they
set aside some money and designate one partner to make more, smaller
bets, and they react as if I&apos;d proposed the partners all get nose
rings.  It&apos;s remarkable how wedded they are to their standard m.o.<br><br>But there is a big opportunity here, and one way or the other it&apos;s
going to get filled.  Either VCs will evolve down into this gap or,
more likely, new investors will appear to fill it.  That will be a
good thing when it happens, because these new investors will be
compelled by the structure of the investments they make to be ten
times bolder than present day VCs.  And that will get us a lot more
Googles.  At least, as long as acquirers remain stupid.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Another tip: If you want to get all that value, don&apos;t destroy the
startup after you buy it.  Give the founders enough autonomy that
they can grow the acquisition into what it would have become.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, David Hornik, Jessica

phrase that became our motto: Make something people want.  We&apos;ve
learned a lot since then, but if I were choosing now that&apos;s still
the one I&apos;d pick.<br><br>Another thing we tell founders is not to worry too much about the
business model, at least at first.  Not because making money is
unimportant, but because it&apos;s so much easier than building something
great.<br><br>A couple weeks ago I realized that if you put those two ideas
together, you get something surprising.  Make something people want.
Don&apos;t worry too much about making money.  What you&apos;ve got is a
description of a charity.<br><br>When you get an unexpected result like this, it could either be a
bug or a new discovery.  Either businesses aren&apos;t supposed to be
like charities, and we&apos;ve proven by reductio ad absurdum that one
or both of the principles we began with is false.  Or we have a new
idea.<br><br>I suspect it&apos;s the latter, because as soon as this thought occurred
to me, a whole bunch of other things fell into place.<br><br><b>Examples</b><br><br>For example, Craigslist.  It&apos;s not a charity, but they run it like
one.  And they&apos;re astoundingly successful.  When you scan down the
list of most popular web sites, the number of employees at Craigslist
looks like a misprint. Their revenues aren&apos;t as high as they could
be, but most startups would be happy to trade places with them.<br><br>In Patrick O&apos;Brian&apos;s novels, his captains always try to get upwind
of their opponents.  If you&apos;re upwind, you decide when and if to
engage the other ship.  Craigslist is effectively upwind of enormous
revenues.  They&apos;d face some challenges if they wanted to make more,
but not the sort you face when you&apos;re tacking upwind, trying to
force a crappy product on ambivalent users by spending ten times
as much on sales as on development.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>I&apos;m not saying startups should aim to end up like Craigslist.
They&apos;re a product of unusual circumstances.  But they&apos;re a good
model for the early phases.<br><br>Google looked a lot like a charity in the beginning. They didn&apos;t
have ads for over a year.  At year 1, Google was indistinguishable
from a nonprofit.  If a nonprofit or government organization had
started a project to index the web, Google at year 1 is the limit
of what they&apos;d have produced.<br><br>Back when I was working on spam filters I thought it would be a
good idea to have a web-based email service with good spam filtering.
I wasn&apos;t thinking of it as a company.  I just wanted to keep people
from getting spammed.  But as I thought more about this project, I
realized it would probably have to be a company.  It would cost
something to run, and it would be a pain to fund with grants and
donations.<br><br>That was a surprising realization.  Companies often claim to be
benevolent, but it was surprising to realize there were purely
benevolent projects that had to be embodied as companies to work.<br><br>I didn&apos;t want to start another company, so I didn&apos;t do it.  But if
someone had, they&apos;d probably be quite rich now.  There was a window
of about two years when spam was increasing rapidly but all the big
email services had terrible filters.  If someone had launched a
new, spam-free mail service, users would have flocked to it.<br><br>Notice the pattern here?  From either direction we get to the same
spot.  If you start from successful startups, you find they often
behaved like nonprofits.  And if you start from ideas for nonprofits,
you find they&apos;d often make good startups.<br><br><b>Power</b><br><br>How wide is this territory?  Would all good nonprofits be good
companies?  Possibly not.  What makes Google so valuable is that
their users have money.  If you make people with money love you,
you can probably get some of it.  But could you also base a successful
startup on behaving like a nonprofit to people who don&apos;t have money?
Could you, for example, grow a successful startup out of curing an
unfashionable but deadly disease like malaria?<br><br>I&apos;m not sure, but I suspect that if you pushed this idea, you&apos;d be
surprised how far it would go.  For example, people who apply to Y
Combinator don&apos;t generally have much money, and yet we can profit
by helping them, because with our help they could make money.  Maybe
the situation is similar with malaria.  Maybe an organization that
helped lift its weight off a country could benefit from the resulting
growth.<br><br>I&apos;m not proposing this is a serious idea.  I don&apos;t know anything
about malaria.  But I&apos;ve been kicking ideas around long enough to
know when I come across a powerful one.<br><br>One way to guess how far an idea extends is to ask yourself at what
point you&apos;d bet against it.  The thought of betting against benevolence
is alarming in the same way as saying that something is technically
impossible.  You&apos;re just asking to be made a fool of, because these
are such powerful forces.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>For example, initially I thought maybe this principle only applied
to Internet startups.  Obviously it worked for Google, but what
about Microsoft?  Surely Microsoft isn&apos;t benevolent?  But when I
think back to the beginning, they were.  Compared to IBM they were
like Robin Hood.  When IBM introduced the PC, they thought they
were going to make money selling hardware at high prices.  But by
gaining control of the PC standard, Microsoft opened up the market
to any manufacturer.  Hardware prices plummeted, and lots of people
got to have computers who couldn&apos;t otherwise have afforded them.
It&apos;s the sort of thing you&apos;d expect Google to do.<br><br>Microsoft isn&apos;t so benevolent now.  Now when one thinks of what
Microsoft does to users, all the verbs that come to mind begin with
F.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font> And yet it doesn&apos;t seem to pay.
Their stock price has been flat for years.  Back when they were
Robin Hood, their stock price rose like Google&apos;s.  Could there be
a connection?<br><br>You can see how there would be.  When you&apos;re small, you can&apos;t bully
customers, so you have to charm them.  Whereas when you&apos;re big you
can maltreat them at will, and you tend to, because it&apos;s easier
than satisfying them.  You grow big by being nice, but you can stay
big by being mean.<br><br>You get away with it till the underlying conditions change, and
then all your victims escape.  So &quot;Don&apos;t be evil&quot; may be the most
valuable thing Paul Buchheit made for Google, because it may turn
out to be an elixir of corporate youth.  I&apos;m sure they find it
constraining, but think how valuable it will be if it saves them
from lapsing into the fatal laziness that afflicted Microsoft and
IBM.<br><br>The curious thing is, this elixir is freely available to any other
company.  Anyone can adopt &quot;Don&apos;t be evil.&quot;  The catch is that
people will hold you to it.  So I don&apos;t think you&apos;re going to see
record labels or tobacco companies using this discovery.<br><br><b>Morale</b><br><br>There&apos;s a lot of external evidence that benevolence works.  But how
does it work?  One advantage of investing in a large number of
startups is that you get a lot of data about how they work.  From
what we&apos;ve seen, being good seems to help startups in three ways:
it improves their morale, it makes other people want to help them,
and above all, it helps them be decisive.<br><br>Morale is tremendously important to a startup&#x2014;so important
that morale alone is almost enough to determine success.  Startups
are often described as emotional roller-coasters. One minute you&apos;re
going to take over the world, and the next you&apos;re doomed.  The
problem with feeling you&apos;re doomed is not just that it makes you
unhappy, but that it makes you <i>stop working</i>.  So the downhills
of the roller-coaster are more of a self fulfilling prophecy than
the uphills.  If feeling you&apos;re going to succeed makes you work
harder, that probably improves your chances of succeeding, but if
feeling you&apos;re going to fail makes you stop working, that practically
guarantees you&apos;ll fail.<br><br>Here&apos;s where benevolence comes in.  If you feel you&apos;re really helping
people, you&apos;ll keep working even when it seems like your startup
is doomed.  Most of us have some amount of natural benevolence.
The mere fact that someone needs you makes you want to help them.
So if you start the kind of startup where users come back each day,
you&apos;ve basically built yourself a giant tamagotchi.  You&apos;ve made
something you need to take care of.<br><br>Blogger is a famous example of a startup that went through really
low lows and survived.  At one point they ran out of money and
everyone left. Evan Williams came in to work the next day, and there
was no one but him.  What kept him going?  Partly that users needed
him.  He was hosting thousands of people&apos;s blogs. He couldn&apos;t just
let the site die.<br><br>There are many advantages of launching quickly, but the most important
may be that once you have users, the tamagotchi effect kicks in.
Once you have users to take care of, you&apos;re forced to figure out
what will make them happy, and that&apos;s actually very valuable
information.<br><br>The added confidence that comes from trying to help people can
also help you with investors. One of the founders of 
<a href="http://chatterous.com">Chatterous</a> told 
me recently that he and his cofounder had decided that this service
was something the world needed, so they were going to keep working
on it no matter what, even if they had to move back to Canada and live
in their parents&apos; basements.<br><br>Once they realized this, they stopped caring so much what investors thought
about them.  They still met with them, but they weren&apos;t going to
die if they didn&apos;t get their money.  And you know what?  The investors
got a lot more interested.  They could sense that the Chatterouses
were going to do this startup with or without them.<br><br>If you&apos;re really committed and your startup is cheap to run, you
become very hard to kill.  And practically all startups, even the
most successful, come close to death at some point.  So if doing
good for people gives you a sense of mission that makes you harder
to kill, that alone more than compensates for whatever you lose by
not choosing a more selfish project.<br><br><b>Help</b><br><br>Another advantage of being good is that it makes other people want
to help you.  This too seems to be an inborn trait in humans.<br><br>One of the startups we&apos;ve funded, <a href="http://octopart.com">Octopart</a>, is currently locked in
a classic battle of good versus evil.  They&apos;re a search site for
industrial components.  A lot of people need to search for components,
and before Octopart there was no good way to do it.  That, it turned
out, was no coincidence.<br><br>Octopart built the right way to search for components.  Users like
it and they&apos;ve been growing rapidly.  And yet for most of Octopart&apos;s
life, the biggest distributor, Digi-Key, has been trying to force
them take their prices off the site.  Octopart is sending them
customers for free, and yet Digi-Key is trying to make that traffic
stop.  Why?  Because their current business model depends on
overcharging people who have incomplete information about prices.
They don&apos;t want search to work.<br><br>The Octoparts are the nicest guys in the world.  They dropped out
of the PhD program in physics at Berkeley to do this.  They just
wanted to fix a problem they encountered in their research.  Imagine
how much time you could save the world&apos;s engineers if they could
do searches online.  So when I hear that a big, evil company is
trying to stop them in order to keep search broken, it makes me
really want to help them. It makes me spend more time on the Octoparts
than I do with most of the other startups we&apos;ve funded.  It just
made me spend several minutes telling you how great they are.  Why?
Because they&apos;re good guys and they&apos;re trying to help the world.<br><br>If you&apos;re benevolent, people will rally around you: investors,
customers, other companies, and potential employees.  In the long
term the most important may be the potential employees.  I think
everyone knows now that 
<a href="gh.html">good hackers</a> are much better than mediocre
ones.  If you can attract the best hackers to work for you, as
Google has, you have a big advantage.  And the very best hackers
tend to be idealistic.  They&apos;re not desperate for a job.  They can
work wherever they want.  So most want to work on things that will
make the world better.<br><br><b>Compass</b><br><br>But the most important advantage of being good is that it acts as
a compass.  One of the hardest parts of doing a startup is that you
have so many choices.  There are just two or three of you, and a
thousand things you could do. How do you decide?<br><br>Here&apos;s the answer: Do whatever&apos;s best for your users.  You can hold
onto this like a rope in a hurricane, and it will save you if
anything can.  Follow it and it will take you through everything
you need to do.<br><br>It&apos;s even the answer to questions that seem unrelated, like how to
convince investors to give you money.  If you&apos;re a good salesman,
you could try to just talk them into it.  But the more reliable
route is to convince them through your users: if you make something
users love enough to tell their friends, you grow exponentially,
and that will convince any investor.<br><br>Being good is a particularly useful strategy for making decisions
in complex situations because it&apos;s stateless.  It&apos;s like telling
the truth.  The trouble with lying is that you have to remember
everything you&apos;ve said in the past to make sure you don&apos;t contradict
yourself.  If you tell the truth you don&apos;t have to remember anything,
and that&apos;s a really useful property in domains where things happen
fast.<br><br>For example, Y Combinator has now invested in 80 startups, 57 of
which are still alive.  (The rest have died or merged or been
acquired.)  When you&apos;re trying to advise 57 startups, it turns out
you have to have a stateless algorithm.  You can&apos;t have ulterior
motives when you have 57 things going on at once, because you can&apos;t
remember them.  So our rule is just to do whatever&apos;s best for the
founders.  Not because we&apos;re particularly benevolent, but because
it&apos;s the only algorithm that works on that scale.<br><br>When you write something telling people to be good, you seem to be
claiming to be good yourself.  So I want to say explicitly that I
am not a particularly good person.  When I was a kid I was firmly
in the camp of bad.  The way adults used the word good, it seemed
to be synonymous with quiet, so I grew up very suspicious of it.<br><br>You know how there are some people whose names come up in conversation
and everyone says &quot;He&apos;s <i>such</i> a great guy?&quot;  People never say
that about me.  The best I get is &quot;he means well.&quot;  I am not claiming
to be good.  At best I speak good as a second language.<br><br>So I&apos;m not suggesting you be good in the usual sanctimonious way.
I&apos;m suggesting it because it works.  It will work not just as a
statement of &quot;values,&quot; but as a guide to strategy,
and even a design spec for software.  Don&apos;t just not be evil.  Be
good.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] Fifty years ago
it would have seemed shocking for a public company not to pay
dividends.  Now many tech companies don&apos;t.  The markets seem to
have figured out how to value potential dividends.  Maybe that isn&apos;t
the last step in this evolution.  Maybe markets will eventually get
comfortable with potential earnings. (VCs already are, and at least
some of them consistently make money.)<br><br>I realize this sounds like the stuff one used to hear about the
&quot;new economy&quot; during the Bubble.  Believe me, I was not drinking
that kool-aid at the time.  But I&apos;m convinced there were some 
<a href="bubble.html">good
ideas</a> buried in Bubble thinking.  For example, it&apos;s ok to focus on
growth instead of profits&#x2014;but only if the growth is genuine.
You can&apos;t be buying users; that&apos;s a pyramid scheme.   But a company
with rapid, genuine growth is valuable, and eventually markets learn
how to value valuable things.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>] The idea of starting
a company with benevolent aims is currently undervalued, because
the kind of people who currently make that their explicit goal don&apos;t
usually do a very good job.<br><br>It&apos;s one of the standard career paths of trustafarians to start
some vaguely benevolent business.  The problem with most of them
is that they either have a bogus political agenda or are feebly
executed.  The trustafarians&apos; ancestors didn&apos;t get rich by preserving
their traditional culture; maybe people in Bolivia don&apos;t want to
either.  And starting an organic farm, though it&apos;s at least
straightforwardly benevolent, doesn&apos;t help people on the scale that
Google does.<br><br>Most explicitly benevolent projects don&apos;t hold themselves sufficiently
accountable.  They act as if having good intentions were enough to
guarantee good effects.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>] Users dislike their
new operating system so much that they&apos;re starting petitions to
save the old one.  And the old one was nothing special.  The hackers

I&apos;m not saying we should stop, but
I think we should at least examine which lies we tell and why.<br><br>There may also be a benefit to us.  We were all lied to as kids,
and some of the lies we were told still affect us.  So by studying
the ways adults lie to kids, we may be able to clear our heads of
lies we were told.<br><br>I&apos;m using the word &quot;lie&quot; in a very general sense: not just overt
falsehoods, but also all the more subtle ways we mislead kids.
Though &quot;lie&quot; has negative connotations, I don&apos;t mean to suggest we
should never do this&#x2014;just that we should pay attention when
we do.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>One of the most remarkable things about the way we lie to kids is
how broad the conspiracy is.  All adults know what their culture 
lies to kids about: they&apos;re the questions you answer &quot;Ask
your parents.&quot;  If a kid asked who won the World Series in 1982
or what the atomic weight of carbon was, you could just tell him.
But if a kid asks you &quot;Is there a God?&quot; or &quot;What&apos;s a prostitute?&quot;
you&apos;ll probably say &quot;Ask your parents.&quot;<br><br>Since we all agree, kids see few cracks in the view of the world
presented to them.  The biggest disagreements are between parents
and schools, but even those are small. Schools are careful what
they say about controversial topics, and if they do contradict what
parents want their kids to believe, parents either pressure the
school into keeping 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=parents+complain+inappropriate+book">quiet</a> or move their kids to a new school.<br><br>The conspiracy is so thorough that most kids who discover it do so
only by discovering internal contradictions in what they&apos;re told.
It can be traumatic for the ones who wake up during the operation.
Here&apos;s what happened to Einstein:
<blockquote>
  Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached
  the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not
  be true.  The consequence was a positively fanatic freethinking
  coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being
  deceived by the state through lies: it was a crushing impression.
  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
I remember that feeling.  By 15 I was convinced the world was corrupt
from end to end.  That&apos;s why movies like <i>The Matrix</i> have such
resonance.  Every kid grows up in a fake world.  In a way it would
be easier if the forces behind it were as clearly differentiated
as a bunch of evil machines, and one could make a clean break just by
taking a pill.<br><br>
<b>Protection</b><br><br>If you ask adults why they lie to kids, the most common reason they
give is to protect them.  And kids do need protecting.  The environment
you want to create for a newborn child will be quite unlike the
streets of a big city.<br><br>That seems so obvious it seems wrong to call it a lie.  It&apos;s certainly
not a bad lie to tell, to give a baby the impression the world is
quiet and warm and safe.  But this harmless type of lie can turn
sour if left unexamined.<br><br>Imagine if you tried to keep someone in as protected an environment
as a newborn till age 18.  To mislead someone so grossly about the
world would seem not protection but abuse.  That&apos;s an extreme
example, of course; when parents do that sort of thing it becomes
national news.  But you see the same problem on a smaller scale in
the malaise teenagers feel in suburbia.<br><br>The main purpose of suburbia is to provide a protected environment
for children to grow up in.  And it seems great for 10 year olds.
I liked living in suburbia when I was 10.  I didn&apos;t notice how
sterile it was.  My whole world was no bigger than a few friends&apos;
houses I bicycled to and some woods I ran around in.  On a log scale
I was midway between crib and globe.  A suburban street was just
the right size.  But as I grew older, suburbia started to feel
suffocatingly fake.<br><br>Life can be pretty good at 10 or 20, but it&apos;s often frustrating at
15.  This is too big a problem to solve here, but certainly one
reason life sucks at 15 is that kids are trapped in a world designed
for 10 year olds.<br><br>What do parents hope to protect their children from by raising them
in suburbia?  A friend who moved out of Manhattan said merely that
her 3 year old daughter &quot;saw too much.&quot;  Off the top of my head,
that might include: people who are high or drunk, poverty, madness,
gruesome medical conditions, sexual behavior of various degrees of
oddness, and violent anger.<br><br>I think it&apos;s the anger that would worry me most if I had a 3 year
old.  I was 29 when I moved to New York and I was surprised even
then.  I wouldn&apos;t want a 3 year old to see some of the disputes I
saw.  It would be too frightening.  A lot of the things adults
conceal from smaller children, they conceal because they&apos;d be
frightening, not because they want to conceal the existence of such
things.  Misleading the child is just a byproduct.<br><br>This seems one of the most justifiable types of lying adults do to
kids.  But because the lies are indirect we don&apos;t keep a very strict
accounting of them.  Parents know they&apos;ve concealed the facts about
sex, and many at some point sit their kids down and explain more.
But few tell their kids about the differences between the real world
and the cocoon they grew up in.  Combine this with the confidence
parents try to instill in their kids, and every year you get a new
crop of 18 year olds who think they know how to run the world.<br><br>Don&apos;t all 18 year olds think they know how to run the world?  Actually
this seems to be a recent innovation, no more than about 100 years old.
In preindustrial times teenage kids were junior members of the adult
world and comparatively well aware of their shortcomings.  They
could see they weren&apos;t as strong or skillful as the village smith.
In past times people lied to kids about some things more than we
do now, but the lies implicit in an artificial, protected environment
are a recent invention.  Like a lot of new inventions, the rich got
this first.  Children of kings and great magnates were the first
to grow up out of touch with the world.  Suburbia means half the
population can live like kings in that respect.<br><br>
<b>Sex (and Drugs)</b><br><br>I&apos;d have different worries about raising teenage kids in New York.
I&apos;d worry less about what they&apos;d see, and more about what they&apos;d
do.  I went to college with a lot of kids who grew up in Manhattan,
and as a rule they seemed pretty jaded.  They seemed to have lost
their virginity at an average of about 14 and by college had tried
more drugs than I&apos;d even heard of.<br><br>The reasons parents don&apos;t want their teenage kids having sex are
complex.  There are some obvious dangers: pregnancy and sexually
transmitted diseases.  But those aren&apos;t the only reasons parents
don&apos;t want their kids having sex.  The average parents of a 14 year
old girl would hate the idea of her having sex even if there were
zero risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.<br><br>Kids can probably sense they aren&apos;t being told the whole story.
After all, pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases are just as
much a problem for adults, and they have sex.<br><br>What really bothers parents about their teenage kids having sex?
Their dislike of the idea is so visceral it&apos;s probably inborn.  But
if it&apos;s inborn it should be universal, and there are plenty of
societies where parents don&apos;t mind if their teenage kids have
sex&#x2014;indeed, where it&apos;s normal for 14 year olds to become
mothers.  So what&apos;s going on?  There does seem to be a universal
taboo against sex with prepubescent children.  One can imagine
evolutionary reasons for that.  And I think this is the main reason
parents in industrialized societies dislike teenage kids having
sex.  They still think of them as children, even though biologically
they&apos;re not, so the taboo against child sex still has force.<br><br>One thing adults conceal about sex they also conceal about drugs:
that it can cause great pleasure.  That&apos;s what makes sex and drugs
so dangerous. The desire for them can cloud one&apos;s judgement&#x2014;which
is especially frightening when the judgement being clouded is the
already wretched judgement of a teenage kid.<br><br>Here parents&apos; desires conflict.  Older societies told kids they had
bad judgement, but modern parents want their children to be confident.
This may well be a better plan than the old one of putting them in
their place, but it has the side effect that after having implicitly
lied to kids about how good their judgement is, we then have to lie
again about all the things they might get into trouble with if they
believed us.<br><br>If parents told their kids the truth about sex and drugs, it would
be: the reason you should avoid these things is that you have lousy
judgement.  People with twice your experience still get burned by
them.  But this may be one of those cases where the truth wouldn&apos;t
be convincing, because one of the symptoms of bad judgement is
believing you have good judgement.  When you&apos;re too weak to lift
something, you can tell, but when you&apos;re making a decision impetuously,
you&apos;re all the more sure of it.<br><br>
<b>Innocence</b><br><br>Another reason parents don&apos;t want their kids having sex is that
they want to keep them innocent.  Adults have a certain model of
how kids are supposed to behave, and it&apos;s different from what they
expect of other adults.<br><br>One of the most obvious differences is the words kids are allowed
to use.  Most parents use words when talking to other adults that
they wouldn&apos;t want their kids using.  They try to hide even the
existence of these words for as long as they can.  And this is
another of those conspiracies everyone participates in: everyone
knows you&apos;re not supposed to swear in front of kids.<br><br>I&apos;ve never heard more different explanations for anything parents
tell kids than why they shouldn&apos;t swear.  Every parent I know forbids
their children to swear, and yet no two of them have the same
justification.  It&apos;s clear most start with not wanting kids to
swear, then make up the reason afterward.<br><br>So my theory about what&apos;s going on is that the <i>function</i> of
swearwords is to mark the speaker as an adult.  There&apos;s no difference
in the meaning of &quot;shit&quot; and &quot;poopoo.&quot;  So why should one be ok for
kids to say and one forbidden?  The only explanation is: by definition.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Why does it bother adults so much when kids do things reserved for
adults?   The idea of a foul-mouthed, cynical 10 year old leaning
against a lamppost with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of
his mouth is very disconcerting.  But why?<br><br>One reason we want kids to be innocent is that we&apos;re programmed to
like certain kinds of helplessness.  I&apos;ve several times heard mothers
say they deliberately refrained from correcting their young children&apos;s
mispronunciations because they were so cute.  And if you think about
it, cuteness is helplessness. Toys and cartoon characters meant to
be cute always have clueless expressions and stubby, ineffectual
limbs.<br><br>It&apos;s not surprising we&apos;d have an inborn desire to love and protect
helpless creatures, considering human offspring are so helpless for
so long.  Without the helplessness that makes kids cute, they&apos;d be
very annoying.  They&apos;d merely seem like incompetent adults.  But
there&apos;s more to it than that.  The reason our hypothetical jaded
10 year old bothers me so much is not just that he&apos;d be annoying,
but that he&apos;d have cut off his prospects for growth so early.  To
be jaded you have to think you know how the world works, and any
theory a 10 year old had about that would probably be a pretty
narrow one.<br><br>Innocence is also open-mindedness.  We want kids to be innocent so
they can continue to learn.  Paradoxical as it sounds, there are
some kinds of knowledge that get in the way of other kinds of
knowledge.  If you&apos;re going to learn that the world is a brutal
place full of people trying to take advantage of one another, you&apos;re
better off learning it last.  Otherwise you won&apos;t bother learning
much more.<br><br>Very smart adults often seem unusually innocent, and I don&apos;t think
this is a coincidence.  I think they&apos;ve deliberately avoided learning
about certain things.  Certainly I do.  I used to think I wanted
to know everything.  Now I know I don&apos;t.<br><br>
<b>Death</b><br><br>After sex, death is the topic adults lie most conspicuously about
to kids.  Sex I believe they conceal because of deep taboos.  But
why do we conceal death from kids?   Probably because small children
are particularly horrified by it.  They want to feel safe, and death
is the ultimate threat.<br><br>One of the most spectacular lies our parents told us was about the
death of our first cat.  Over the years, as we asked for more
details, they were compelled to invent more, so the story grew quite
elaborate.  The cat had died at the vet&apos;s office.  Of what?  Of the
anaesthesia itself.  Why was the cat at the vet&apos;s office?  To be
fixed.  And why had such a routine operation killed it?  It wasn&apos;t
the vet&apos;s fault; the cat had a congenitally weak heart; the anaesthesia
was too much for it; but there was no way anyone could have
known this in advance.  It was not till we were in our twenties
that the truth came out: my sister, then about three, had accidentally
stepped on the cat and broken its back.<br><br>They didn&apos;t feel the need to tell us the cat was now happily in cat
heaven.  My parents never claimed that people or animals who died
had &quot;gone to a better place,&quot; or that we&apos;d meet them again.  It
didn&apos;t seem to harm us.<br><br>My grandmother told us an edited version of the death of my
grandfather.  She said they&apos;d been sitting reading one day, and
when she said something to him, he didn&apos;t answer.  He seemed to be
asleep, but when she tried to rouse him, she couldn&apos;t.  &quot;He was
gone.&quot; Having a heart attack sounded like falling asleep.  Later I
learned it hadn&apos;t been so neat, and the heart attack had taken most
of a day to kill him.<br><br>Along with such outright lies, there must have been a lot of changing
the subject when death came up.  I can&apos;t remember that, of course,
but I can infer it from the fact that I didn&apos;t really grasp I was
going to die till I was about 19.  How could I have missed something
so obvious for so long?  Now that I&apos;ve seen parents managing the
subject, I can see how: questions about death are gently but firmly
turned aside.<br><br>On this topic, especially, they&apos;re met half-way by kids.  Kids often
want to be lied to.  They want to believe they&apos;re living in a
comfortable, safe world as much as their parents want them to believe
it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Identity</b><br><br>Some parents feel a strong adherence to an ethnic or religious group
and want their kids to feel it too.  This usually requires two
different kinds of lying: the first is to tell the child that he
or she is an X, and the second is whatever specific lies Xes
differentiate themselves by believing.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Telling a child they have a particular ethnic or religious identity
is one of the stickiest things you can tell them.  Almost anything
else you tell a kid, they can change their mind about later when
they start to think for themselves.  But if you tell a kid they&apos;re
a member of a certain group, that seems nearly impossible to shake.<br><br>This despite the fact that it can be one of the most premeditated
lies parents tell.  When parents are of different religions, they&apos;ll
often agree between themselves that their children will be &quot;raised
as Xes.&quot;  And it works. The kids obligingly grow up considering
themselves as Xes, despite the fact that if their parents had chosen
the other way, they&apos;d have grown up considering themselves as Ys.<br><br>One reason this works so well is the second kind of lie involved.
The truth is common property.  You can&apos;t distinguish your group by
doing things that are rational, and believing things that are true.
If you want to set yourself apart from other people, you have to
do things that are arbitrary, and believe things that are false.
And after having spent their whole lives doing things that are arbitrary
and believing things that are false, and being regarded as odd by
&quot;outsiders&quot; on that account, the cognitive dissonance pushing
children to regard themselves as Xes must be enormous.  If they
aren&apos;t an X, why are they attached to all these arbitrary beliefs
and customs?  If they aren&apos;t an X, why do all the non-Xes call them
one?<br><br>This form of lie is not without its uses.  You can use it to carry
a payload of beneficial beliefs, and they will also become part of
the child&apos;s identity.  You can tell the child that in addition to
never wearing the color yellow, believing the world was created by
a giant rabbit, and always snapping their fingers before eating
fish, Xes are also particularly honest and industrious.  Then X
children will grow up feeling it&apos;s part of their identity to be
honest and industrious.<br><br>This probably accounts for a lot of the spread of modern religions,
and explains why their doctrines are a combination of the useful
and the bizarre.  The bizarre half is what makes the religion stick,
and the useful half is the payload.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Authority</b><br><br>One of the least excusable reasons adults lie to kids is to maintain
power over them.  Sometimes these lies are truly sinister, like a
child molester telling his victims they&apos;ll get in trouble if they
tell anyone what happened to them.  Others seem more innocent; it
depends how badly adults lie to maintain their power, and what they
use it for.<br><br>Most adults make some effort to conceal their flaws from children.
Usually their motives are mixed.  For example, a father who has an
affair generally conceals it from his children.  His motive is
partly that it would worry them, partly that this would introduce
the topic of sex, and partly (a larger part than he would admit)

Peter Mayle wrote
one called <i>Why Are We Getting a Divorce?</i>  It begins with the three
most important things to remember about divorce, one of which is:
<blockquote>
  You shouldn&apos;t put the blame on one parent, because divorce is
  never only one person&apos;s fault.
  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
Really?  When a man runs off with his secretary, is it always partly
his wife&apos;s fault?  But I can see why Mayle might have said this.
Maybe it&apos;s more important for kids to respect their parents than
to know the truth about them.<br><br>But because adults conceal their flaws, and at the same time insist
on high standards of behavior for kids, a lot of kids grow up feeling
they fall hopelessly short.  They walk around feeling horribly evil
for having used a swearword, while in fact most of the adults around
them are doing much worse things.<br><br>This happens in intellectual as well as moral questions.  The more
confident people are, the more willing they seem to be to answer a
question &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;  Less confident people feel they have to
have an answer or they&apos;ll look bad.  My parents were pretty good
about admitting when they didn&apos;t know things, but I must have been
told a lot of lies of this type by teachers, because I rarely heard
a teacher say &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot; till I got to college.  I remember
because it was so surprising to hear someone say that in front of
a class.<br><br>The first hint I had that teachers weren&apos;t omniscient came in sixth
grade, after my father contradicted something I&apos;d learned in school.
When I protested that the teacher had said the opposite, my father
replied that the guy had no idea what he was talking about&#x2014;that
he was just an elementary school teacher, after all.<br><br><i>Just</i> a teacher?  The phrase seemed almost grammatically ill-formed.
Didn&apos;t teachers know everything about the subjects they taught?
And if not, why were they the ones teaching us?<br><br>The sad fact is, US public school teachers don&apos;t generally understand
the stuff they&apos;re teaching very well.  There are some sterling
exceptions, but as a rule people planning to go into teaching rank
academically near the bottom of the college population.  So the
fact that I still thought at age 11 that teachers were infallible
shows what a job the system must have done on my brain.<br><br>
<b>School</b><br><br>What kids get taught in school is a complex mix of lies.  The most
excusable are those told to simplify ideas to make them easy to
learn.  The problem is, a lot of propaganda gets slipped into the
curriculum in the name of simplification.<br><br>Public school textbooks represent a compromise between what various
powerful groups want kids to be told.  The lies are rarely overt.
Usually they consist either of omissions or of over-emphasizing
certain topics at the expense of others.  The view of history we
got in elementary school was a crude hagiography, with at least one
representative of each powerful group.<br><br>The famous scientists I remember were Einstein, Marie Curie, and
George Washington Carver.   Einstein was a big deal because his
work led to the atom bomb.  Marie Curie was involved with X-rays.
But I was mystified about Carver.  He seemed to have done stuff
with peanuts.<br><br>It&apos;s obvious now that he was on the list because he was black (and
for that matter that Marie Curie was on it because she was a woman),
but as a kid I was confused for years about him.  I wonder if it
wouldn&apos;t have been better just to tell us the truth: that there
weren&apos;t any famous black scientists.  Ranking George Washington
Carver with Einstein misled us not only about science, but about
the obstacles blacks faced in his time.<br><br>As subjects got softer, the lies got more frequent.  By the time
you got to politics and recent history, what we were taught was
pretty much pure propaganda.  For example, we were taught to regard
political leaders as saints&#x2014;especially the recently martyred
Kennedy and King.  It was astonishing to learn later that they&apos;d
both been serial womanizers, and that Kennedy was a speed freak to
boot.  (By the time King&apos;s plagiarism emerged, I&apos;d lost the ability
to be surprised by the misdeeds of famous people.)<br><br>I doubt you could teach kids recent history without teaching them
lies, because practically everyone who has anything to say about
it has some kind of spin to put on it.  Much recent history <i>consists</i>
of spin.  It would probably be better just to teach them metafacts
like that.<br><br>Probably the biggest lie told in schools, though, is that the way
to succeed is through following &quot;the rules.&quot;  In fact most such
rules are just hacks to manage large groups efficiently.<br><br>
<b>Peace</b><br><br>Of all the reasons we lie to kids, the most powerful is probably
the same mundane reason they lie to us.<br><br>Often when we lie to people it&apos;s not part of any conscious strategy,
but because they&apos;d react violently to the truth.  Kids, almost by
definition, lack self-control.  They react violently to things&#x2014;and
so they get lied to a lot. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>A few Thanksgivings ago, a friend of mine found himself in a situation
that perfectly illustrates the complex motives we have when we lie
to kids.  As the roast turkey appeared on the table, his alarmingly
perceptive 5 year old son suddenly asked if the turkey had wanted
to die.  Foreseeing disaster, my friend and his wife rapidly
improvised: yes, the turkey had wanted to die, and in fact had lived
its whole life with the aim of being their Thanksgiving dinner.
And that (phew) was the end of that.<br><br>Whenever we lie to kids to protect them, we&apos;re usually also lying
to keep the peace.<br><br>One consequence of this sort of calming lie is that we grow up
thinking horrible things are normal.  It&apos;s hard for us to feel a
sense of urgency as adults over something we&apos;ve literally been
trained not to worry about.  When I was about 10 I saw a documentary
on pollution that put me into a panic.  It seemed the planet was
being irretrievably ruined.  I went to my mother afterward to ask
if this was so.  I don&apos;t remember what she said, but she made me
feel better, so I stopped worrying about it.<br><br>That was probably the best way to handle a frightened 10 year old.
But we should understand the price.  This sort of lie is one of the
main reasons bad things persist: we&apos;re all trained to ignore them.<br><br>
<b>Detox</b><br><br>A sprinter in a race almost immediately enters a state called &quot;oxygen
debt.&quot;  His body switches to an emergency source of energy that&apos;s
faster than regular aerobic respiration.  But this process builds
up waste products that ultimately require extra oxygen to break
down, so at the end of the race he has to stop and pant for a while
to recover.<br><br>We arrive at adulthood with a kind of truth debt.  We were told a
lot of lies to get us (and our parents) through our childhood.  Some
may have been necessary.  Some probably weren&apos;t.  But we all arrive
at adulthood with heads full of lies.<br><br>There&apos;s never a point where the adults sit you down and explain all
the lies they told you.  They&apos;ve forgotten most of them.  So if
you&apos;re going to clear these lies out of your head, you&apos;re going to
have to do it yourself.<br><br>Few do.  Most people go through life with bits of packing material
adhering to their minds and never know it.  You probably never can
completely undo the effects of lies you were told as a kid, but
it&apos;s worth trying.  I&apos;ve found that whenever I&apos;ve been able to undo
a lie I was told, a lot of other things fell into place.<br><br>Fortunately, once you arrive at adulthood you get a valuable new
resource you can use to figure out what lies you were told.  You&apos;re
now one of the liars.  You get to watch behind the scenes as adults
spin the world for the next generation of kids.<br><br>The first step in clearing your head is to realize how far you are
from a neutral observer.  When I left high school I was, I thought,
a complete skeptic.  I&apos;d realized high school was crap.  I thought
I was ready to question everything I knew.  But among the many other
things I was ignorant of was how much debris there already was in
my head.  It&apos;s not enough to consider your mind a blank slate.  You
have to consciously erase it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
One reason I stuck with such a brutally simple word is that
the lies we tell kids are probably not quite as harmless as we
think.  If you look at what adults told children in the past, it&apos;s
shocking how much they lied to them.  Like us, they did it with the
best intentions.  So if we think we&apos;re as open as one could reasonably
be with children, we&apos;re probably fooling ourselves.  Odds are people
in 100 years will be as shocked at some of the lies we tell as we
are at some of the lies people told 100 years ago.<br><br>I can&apos;t predict which these will be, and I don&apos;t want to write an
essay that will seem dumb in 100 years.  So instead of using special
euphemisms for lies that seem excusable according to present fashions,
I&apos;m just going to call all our lies lies.<br><br>(I have omitted one type: lies told to play games with kids&apos;
credulity.  These range from &quot;make-believe,&quot; which is not really a
lie because it&apos;s told with a wink, to the frightening lies told by
older siblings.   There&apos;s not much to say about these: I wouldn&apos;t
want the first type to go away, and wouldn&apos;t expect the second type
to.)<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]

If you ask parents why kids shouldn&apos;t swear, the less educated
ones usually reply with some question-begging answer like &quot;it&apos;s
inappropriate,&quot; while the more educated ones come up with elaborate
rationalizations.  In fact the less educated parents seem closer
to the truth.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
As a friend with small children pointed out, it&apos;s easy for small
children to consider themselves immortal, because time seems to
pass so slowly for them.  To a 3 year old, a day feels like a month
might to an adult.  So 80 years sounds to him like 2400 years would
to us.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
I realize I&apos;m going to get endless grief for classifying religion
as a type of lie.  Usually people skirt that issue with some
equivocation implying that lies believed for a sufficiently long
time by sufficiently large numbers of people are immune to the usual
standards for truth.  But because I can&apos;t predict which lies future
generations will consider inexcusable, I can&apos;t safely omit any type
we tell.  Yes, it seems unlikely that religion will be out of fashion
in 100 years, but no more unlikely than it would have seemed to
someone in 1880 that schoolchildren in 1980 would be taught that
masturbation was perfectly normal and not to feel guilty about it.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Unfortunately the payload can consist of bad customs as well
as good ones.  For example, there are certain qualities that some
groups in America consider &quot;acting white.&quot;  In fact most of them
could as accurately be called &quot;acting Japanese.&quot;  There&apos;s nothing
specifically white about such customs. They&apos;re common to all cultures
with long traditions of living in cities.  So it is probably a
losing bet for a group to consider behaving the opposite way as
part of its identity.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
In this context, &quot;issues&quot; basically means &quot;things we&apos;re going
to lie to them about.&quot;  That&apos;s why there&apos;s a special name for these
topics.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]

The ironic thing is, this is also the main reason kids lie to
adults.  If you freak out when people tell you alarming things,
they won&apos;t tell you them.  Teenagers don&apos;t tell their parents what
happened that night they were supposed to be staying at a friend&apos;s
house for the same reason parents don&apos;t tell 5 year olds the truth
about the Thanksgiving turkey.  They&apos;d freak if they knew.<br><br>

It would work for a while, and then I&apos;d gradually find myself
using the Internet on my work computer.  I&apos;m trying other
strategies now, but I think this time I&apos;ll wait till I&apos;m sure
they work before writing about them.</i><br><br>May 2008<br><br>Procrastination feeds on distractions.  Most people find it
uncomfortable just to sit and do nothing; you avoid work by doing
something else.<br><br>So one way to beat procrastination is to starve it of distractions.
But that&apos;s not as straightforward as it sounds, because there are
people working hard to distract you.  Distraction is not a static
obstacle that you avoid like you might avoid a rock in the road.
Distraction seeks you out.<br><br>Chesterfield described dirt as matter out of place.  Distracting
is, similarly, desirable at the wrong time.  And technology is
continually being refined to produce more and more desirable things.
Which means that as we learn to avoid one class of distractions,
new ones constantly appear, like drug-resistant bacteria.<br><br>Television, for example, has after 50 years of refinement reached
the point where it&apos;s like visual crack.  I realized when I was 13
that TV was addictive, so I stopped watching it.  But I read recently
 that the average American watches 
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/0929/076.html">4 hours</a> 
of TV a day.  A quarter
of their life.<br><br>TV is in decline now, but only because people have found even more
addictive ways of wasting time.  And what&apos;s especially dangerous
is that many happen at your computer.  This is no accident.  An
ever larger percentage of office workers sit in front of computers
connected to the Internet, and distractions always evolve toward
the procrastinators.<br><br>I remember when computers were, for me at least, exclusively for
work.  I might occasionally dial up a server to get mail or ftp
files, but most of the time I was offline.  All I could do was write
and program.  Now I feel as if someone snuck a television onto my
desk.  Terribly addictive things are just a click away.  Run into
an obstacle in what you&apos;re working on?  Hmm, I wonder what&apos;s new
online.  Better check.<br><br>After years of carefully avoiding classic time sinks like TV, games,
and Usenet, I still managed to fall prey to distraction, because
I didn&apos;t realize that it evolves.  Something that used to be safe,
using the Internet, gradually became more and more dangerous.  Some
days I&apos;d wake up, get a cup of tea and check the news, then check
email, then check the news again, then answer a few emails, then
suddenly notice it was almost lunchtime and I hadn&apos;t gotten any real
work done.  And this started to happen more and more often.<br><br>It took me surprisingly long to realize how distracting the Internet
had become, because the problem was intermittent.  I ignored it the
way you let yourself ignore a bug that only appears intermittently.  When
I was in the middle of a project, distractions weren&apos;t really a
problem.  It was when I&apos;d finished one project and was deciding
what to do next that they always bit me.<br><br>Another reason it was hard to notice the danger of this new type
of distraction was that social customs hadn&apos;t yet caught up with
it.  If I&apos;d spent a whole morning sitting on a sofa watching TV,
I&apos;d have noticed very quickly.  That&apos;s a known danger sign, like
drinking alone.  But using the Internet still looked and felt a 
lot like work.<br><br>Eventually, though, it became clear that the Internet had become so much
more distracting that I had to start treating it differently.
Basically, I had to add a new application to my list of known time
sinks: Firefox.<br><br><center>* * *</center><br><br>The problem is a hard one to solve because most people still need
the Internet for some things.  If you drink too much, you can solve
that problem by stopping entirely.  But you can&apos;t solve the problem
of overeating by stopping eating.  I couldn&apos;t simply avoid the 
Internet entirely, as I&apos;d done with previous time sinks.<br><br>At first I tried rules.  For example, I&apos;d tell myself I was only
going to use the Internet twice a day.  But these schemes never
worked for long.  Eventually something would come up that required
me to use it more than that.  And then I&apos;d gradually slip back
into my old ways.<br><br>Addictive things have to be treated as if they were sentient
adversaries&#x2014;as if there were a little man in your head always
cooking up the most plausible arguments for doing whatever you&apos;re
trying to stop doing.  If you leave a path to it, he&apos;ll find it.<br><br>The key seems to be visibility.  The biggest ingredient in most bad habits
is denial.  So you have to make it so that you can&apos;t merely <i>slip</i>
into doing the thing you&apos;re trying to avoid.  It has to set off
alarms.<br><br>Maybe in the long term the right answer for dealing with Internet
distractions will be 
<a href="http://rescuetime.com">software</a> that watches and controls them.  But
in the meantime I&apos;ve found a more drastic solution that definitely
works: to set up a separate computer for using the Internet.<br><br>I now leave wifi turned off on my main computer except when I need
to transfer a file or edit a web page, and I have a separate laptop 
on the other side
of the room that I use to check mail or browse the web.  (Irony of
ironies, it&apos;s the computer Steve Huffman wrote Reddit on.  When
Steve and Alexis auctioned off their old laptops for charity, I
bought them for the Y Combinator museum.)<br><br>My rule is that I can spend as much time online as I want, as long
as I do it on that computer.  And this turns out to be enough.  When
I have to sit on the other side of the room to check email or browse
the web, I become much more aware of it.  Sufficiently aware, in
my case at least, that it&apos;s hard to spend more than about an hour
a day online.<br><br>And my main computer is now freed for work.  If you try this trick,
you&apos;ll probably be struck by how different it feels when your
computer is disconnected from the Internet.  It was alarming to me
how foreign it felt to sit in front of a computer that could
only be used for work, because that showed how much time I must
have been wasting.<br><br><i>Wow.  All I can do at this computer is work.  Ok, I better work
then.</i><br><br>That&apos;s the good part.  Your old bad habits now help you to work.
You&apos;re used to sitting in front of that computer for hours at a
time.   But you can&apos;t browse the web or check email now.  What are
you going to do?  You can&apos;t just sit there.  So you start working.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="210"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html">Good and Bad Procrastination</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="210"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://wiki.alsanan.info/index.php?nom=desconectar%20las%20distracciones">Spanish Translation</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="210"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://blog.amr-g.com/?p=11">Arabic Translation</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="210"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://capalfar.wordpress.com/2008/05/20/traduccions-de-paul-graham-2-disconnecting-distraction/">Catalan Translation</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="210"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://ryba4.com/translations/distraction">Russian Translation</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></td><td width="210"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.internazionale.it/interblog/index.php?itemid=2579">Spanish Translation</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="cities">Cities and Ambition</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">May 2008<br><br><!-- <table width=410 cellpadding=6 cellspacing=0>

Great cities attract ambitious people.  You can sense it when you
walk around one.  In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you a
message: you could do more; you should try harder.<br><br>The surprising thing is how different these messages can be.  New
York tells you, above all: you should make more money.  There are
other messages too, of course.  You should be hipper.  You should
be better looking.  But the clearest message is that you should be
richer.<br><br>What I like about Boston (or rather Cambridge) is that the message
there is: you should be smarter.  You really should get around to
reading all those books you&apos;ve been meaning to.<br><br>When you ask what message a city sends, you sometimes get surprising
answers.  As much as they respect brains in Silicon Valley, the
message the Valley sends is: you should be more powerful.<br><br>That&apos;s not quite the same message New York sends.  Power matters
in New York too of course, but New York is pretty impressed by a
billion dollars even if you merely inherited it.  In Silicon Valley
no one would care except a few real estate agents.  What matters
in Silicon Valley is how much effect you have on the world.  The
reason people there care about Larry and Sergey is not their wealth
but the fact that they control Google, which affects practically
everyone.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>How much does it matter what message a city sends?  Empirically,
the answer seems to be: a lot. You might think that if you had
enough strength of mind to do great things, you&apos;d be able to transcend
your environment.  Where you live should make at most a couple
percent difference.  But if you look at the historical evidence,
it seems to matter more than that.  Most people who did great things
were clumped together in a few places where that sort of thing was
done at the time.<br><br>You can see how powerful cities are from something I wrote about
<a href="taste.html">earlier</a>: the case of the Milanese Leonardo.  
Practically every
fifteenth century Italian painter you&apos;ve heard of was from Florence,
even though Milan was just as big.  People in Florence weren&apos;t
genetically different, so you have to assume there was someone born
in Milan with as much natural ability as Leonardo.  What happened
to him?<br><br>If even someone with the same natural ability as Leonardo
couldn&apos;t beat the force of environment, do you suppose you can?<br><br>I don&apos;t.  I&apos;m fairly stubborn, but I wouldn&apos;t try to fight this
force.  I&apos;d rather use it.  So I&apos;ve thought a lot about where to
live.<br><br>I&apos;d always imagined Berkeley would be the ideal place&#x2014;that
it would basically be Cambridge with good weather.  But when I
finally tried living there a couple years ago, it turned out not
to be.  The message Berkeley sends is: you should live better.  Life
in Berkeley is very civilized.  It&apos;s probably the place in America
where someone from Northern Europe would feel most at home.  But
it&apos;s not humming with ambition.<br><br>In retrospect it shouldn&apos;t have been surprising that a place so
pleasant would attract people interested above all in quality of
life.  Cambridge with good weather, it turns out, is not Cambridge.
The people you find in Cambridge are not there by accident.  You
have to make sacrifices to live there.  It&apos;s expensive and somewhat
grubby, and the weather&apos;s often bad.  So the kind of people you
find in Cambridge are the kind of people who want to live where the
smartest people are, even if that means living in an expensive,
grubby place with bad weather.<br><br>As of this writing, Cambridge seems to be the intellectual capital
of the world.  I realize that seems a preposterous claim.  What
makes it true is that it&apos;s more preposterous to claim about anywhere
else.  American universities currently seem to be the best, judging
from the flow of ambitious students.  And what US city has a stronger
claim?  New York?  A fair number of smart people, but diluted by a
much larger number of neanderthals in suits.  The Bay Area has a
lot of smart people too, but again, diluted;  there are two great
universities, but they&apos;re far apart.  Harvard and MIT are practically
adjacent by West Coast standards, and they&apos;re surrounded by about
20 other colleges and universities.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Cambridge as a result feels like a town whose main industry is
ideas, while New York&apos;s is finance and Silicon Valley&apos;s is startups.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>When you talk about cities in the sense we are, what you&apos;re really
talking about is collections of people.  For a long time cities
were the only large collections of people, so you could use the two
ideas interchangeably.  But we can see how much things are changing
from the examples I&apos;ve mentioned.  New York is a classic great city.
But Cambridge is just part of a city, and Silicon Valley is not
even that.  (San Jose is not, as it sometimes claims, the capital
of Silicon Valley.  It&apos;s just 178 square miles at one end of it.)<br><br>Maybe the Internet will change things further.  Maybe one day the
most important community you belong to will be a virtual one, and
it won&apos;t matter where you live physically.  But I wouldn&apos;t bet on
it.  The physical world is very high bandwidth, and some of the
ways cities send you messages are quite subtle.<br><br>One of the exhilarating things about coming back to Cambridge every
spring is walking through the streets at dusk, when you can see
into the houses.  When you walk through Palo Alto in the evening,
you see nothing but the blue glow of TVs.  In Cambridge you see
shelves full of promising-looking books.  Palo Alto was probably
much like Cambridge in 1960, but you&apos;d never guess now that there
was a university nearby.  Now it&apos;s just one of the richer neighborhoods
in Silicon Valley. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>A city speaks to you mostly by accident&#x2014;in things you see
through windows, in conversations you overhear.  It&apos;s not something
you have to seek out, but something you can&apos;t turn off.  One of the
occupational hazards of living in Cambridge is overhearing the
conversations of people who use interrogative intonation in declarative
sentences.  But on average I&apos;ll take Cambridge conversations over
New York or Silicon Valley ones.<br><br>A friend who moved to Silicon Valley in the late 90s said the worst
thing about living there was the low quality of the eavesdropping.
At the time I thought she was being deliberately eccentric. Sure,
it can be interesting to eavesdrop on people, but is good quality
eavesdropping so important that it would affect where you chose to
live?  Now I understand what she meant.  The conversations you
overhear tell you what sort of people you&apos;re among.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>No matter how determined you are, it&apos;s hard not to be influenced
by the people around you.  It&apos;s not so much that you do whatever a
city expects of you, but that you get discouraged when no one around
you cares about the same things you do.<br><br>There&apos;s an imbalance between encouragement and discouragement like
that between gaining and losing money.  Most people overvalue
negative amounts of money: they&apos;ll work much harder to avoid losing
a dollar than to gain one.  Similarly, although there are plenty of
people strong enough to resist doing something just because that&apos;s
what one is supposed to do where they happen to be, there are few
strong enough to keep working on something no one around them cares
about.<br><br>Because ambitions are to some extent incompatible and admiration
is a zero-sum game, each city tends to focus on one type of ambition.
The reason Cambridge is the intellectual capital is not just that
there&apos;s a concentration of smart people there, but that there&apos;s
nothing <i>else</i> people there care about more.  Professors in
New York and the Bay area are second class citizens&#x2014;till they
start hedge funds or startups respectively.<br><br>This suggests an answer to a question people in New York have
wondered about since the Bubble: whether New York could grow into
a startup hub to rival Silicon Valley.  One reason that&apos;s unlikely
is that someone starting a startup in New York would feel like a
second class citizen. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
There&apos;s already something else people in New York admire more.<br><br>In the long term, that could be a bad thing for New York.  The power
of an important new technology does eventually convert to money.
So by caring more about money and less about power than Silicon
Valley, New York is recognizing the same thing, but slower.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
And in fact it has been losing to Silicon Valley at its own game:
the ratio of New York to California residents in the Forbes 400 has
decreased from 1.45 (81:56) when the list was first published in
1982 to .83 (73:88) in 2007.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Not all cities send a message.  Only those that are centers for
some type of ambition do.  And it can be hard to tell exactly what
message a city sends without living there.  I understand the messages
of New York, Cambridge, and Silicon Valley because I&apos;ve lived for
several years in each of them.  DC and LA seem to send messages
too, but I haven&apos;t spent long enough in either to say for sure what
they are.<br><br>The big thing in LA seems to be fame.  There&apos;s an A List of people
who are most in demand right now, and what&apos;s most admired is to be
on it, or friends with those who are.  Beneath that the message is
much like New York&apos;s, though perhaps with more emphasis on physical
attractiveness.<br><br>In DC the message seems to be that the most important thing is who
you know.  You want to be an insider.  In practice this seems to
work much as in LA.  There&apos;s an A List and you want to be on it or
close to those who are.  The only difference is how the A List is
selected.  And even that is not that different.<br><br>At the moment, San Francisco&apos;s message seems to be the same as
Berkeley&apos;s: you should live better.  But this will change if enough
startups choose SF over the Valley.  During the Bubble that was a
predictor of failure&#x2014;a self-indulgent choice, like buying
expensive office furniture.  Even now I&apos;m suspicious when startups
choose SF.  But if enough good ones do, it stops being a self-indulgent
choice, because the center of gravity of Silicon Valley will shift
there.<br><br>I haven&apos;t found anything like Cambridge for intellectual ambition.
Oxford and Cambridge (England) feel like Ithaca or Hanover: the
message is there, but not as strong.<br><br>Paris was once a great intellectual center.  If you went there in
1300, it might have sent the message Cambridge does now.  But I
tried living there for a bit last year, and the ambitions of the
inhabitants are not intellectual ones.  The message Paris sends now
is: do things with style.  I liked that, actually.  Paris is the
only city I&apos;ve lived in where people genuinely cared about art.  In
America only a few rich people buy original art, and even the more
sophisticated ones rarely get past judging it by the brand name of
the artist.  But looking through windows at dusk in Paris you can
see that people there actually care what paintings look like.
Visually, Paris has the best eavesdropping I know. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>There&apos;s one more message I&apos;ve heard from cities: in London you can
still (barely) hear the message that one should be more aristocratic.
If you listen for it you can also hear it in Paris, New York, and
Boston.  But this message is everywhere very faint.  It would have
been strong 100 years ago, but now I probably wouldn&apos;t have picked
it up at all if I hadn&apos;t deliberately tuned in to that wavelength
to see if there was any signal left.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>So far the complete list of messages I&apos;ve picked up from cities is:
wealth, style, hipness, physical attractiveness, fame, political
power, economic power, intelligence, social class, and quality of
life.<br><br>My immediate reaction to this list is that it makes me slightly
queasy.  I&apos;d always considered ambition a good thing, but I realize
now that was because I&apos;d always implicitly understood it to mean
ambition in the areas I cared about.  When you list everything
ambitious people are ambitious about, it&apos;s not so pretty.<br><br>On closer examination I see a couple things on the list that are
surprising in the light of history.  For example, physical
attractiveness wouldn&apos;t have been there 100 years ago (though it
might have been 2400 years ago).  It has always mattered for women,
but in the late twentieth century it seems to have started to matter
for men as well.  I&apos;m not sure why&#x2014;probably some combination
of the increasing power of women, the increasing influence of actors
as models, and the fact that so many people work in offices now:
you can&apos;t show off by wearing clothes too fancy to wear in a factory,
so you have to show off with your body instead.<br><br>Hipness is another thing you wouldn&apos;t have seen on the list 100
years ago.  Or wouldn&apos;t you?  What it means is to know what&apos;s what.
So maybe it has simply replaced the component of social class that
consisted of being &quot;au fait.&quot;  That could explain why hipness seems
particularly admired in London: it&apos;s version 2 of the traditional
English delight in obscure codes that only insiders understand.<br><br>Economic power would have been on the list 100 years ago, but what
we mean by it is changing.  It used to mean the control of vast
human and material resources.  But increasingly it means the ability
to direct the course of technology, and some of the people in a
position to do that are not even rich&#x2014;leaders of important
open source projects, for example.  The Captains of Industry of
times past had laboratories full of clever people cooking up new
technologies for them.  The new breed are themselves those people.<br><br>As this force gets more attention, another is dropping off the list:
social class.  I think the two changes are related.  Economic power,
wealth, and social class are just names for the same thing at
different stages in its life: economic power converts to wealth,
and wealth to social class.  So the focus of admiration is simply
shifting upstream.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Does anyone who wants to do great work have to live in a great city?
No; all great cities inspire some sort of ambition, but they aren&apos;t
the only places that do.  For some kinds of work, all you need is
a handful of talented colleagues.<br><br>What cities provide is an audience, and a funnel for peers.  These
aren&apos;t so critical in something like math or physics, where no
audience matters except your peers, and judging ability is sufficiently
straightforward that hiring and admissions committees can do it
reliably.  In a field like math or physics all you need is a
department with the right colleagues in it.  It could be anywhere&#x2014;in
Los Alamos, New Mexico, for example.<br><br>It&apos;s in fields like the arts or writing or technology that the
larger environment matters.  In these the best practitioners aren&apos;t
conveniently collected in a few top university departments and
research labs&#x2014;partly because talent is harder to judge, and
partly because people pay for these things, so one doesn&apos;t need to
rely on teaching or research funding to support oneself.  It&apos;s in
these more chaotic fields that it helps most to be in a great city:
you need the encouragement of feeling that people around you care
about the kind of work you do, and since you have to find peers for
yourself, you need the much larger intake mechanism of a great city.<br><br>You don&apos;t have to live in a great city your whole life to benefit
from it.  The critical years seem to be the early and middle ones
of your career.  Clearly you don&apos;t have to grow up in a great city.
Nor does it seem to matter if you go to college in one.  To most
college students a world of a few thousand people seems big enough.
Plus in college you don&apos;t yet have to face the hardest kind of
work&#x2014;discovering new problems to solve.<br><br>It&apos;s when you move on to the next and much harder step that it helps
most to be in a place where you can find peers and encouragement.
You seem to be able to leave, if you want, once you&apos;ve found both.
The Impressionists show the typical pattern: they were born all
over France (Pissarro was born in the Carribbean) and died all over
France, but what defined them were the years they spent together
in Paris.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Unless you&apos;re sure what you want to do and where the leading center
for it is, your best bet is probably to try living in several
places when you&apos;re young.  You can never tell what message a city
sends till you live there, or even whether it still sends one.
Often your information will be wrong: I tried living in Florence
when I was 25, thinking it would be an art center, but it turned
out I was 450 years too late.<br><br>Even when a city is still a live center of ambition, you won&apos;t know
for sure whether its message will resonate with you till you hear
it.  When I moved to New York, I was very excited at first.  It&apos;s
an exciting place.  So it took me quite a while to realize I just
wasn&apos;t like the people there.  I kept searching for the Cambridge
of New York.  It turned out it was way, way uptown: an hour uptown
by air.<br><br>Some people know at 16 what sort of work they&apos;re going to do, but
in most ambitious kids, ambition seems to precede anything specific
to be ambitious about.  They know they want to do something great.
They just haven&apos;t decided yet whether they&apos;re going to be a rock
star or a brain surgeon.  There&apos;s nothing wrong with that.  But it
means if you have this most common type of ambition, you&apos;ll probably
have to figure out where to live by trial and error.  You&apos;ll
probably have to find the city where you feel at home to know what sort of
ambition you have.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This is one of the advantages of not having the universities
in your country controlled by the government.  When governments
decide how to allocate resources, political deal-making causes
things to be spread out geographically.  No central goverment would
put its two best universities in the same town, unless it was the
capital (which would cause other problems).  But scholars seem to
like to cluster together as much as people in any other field, and
when given the freedom to they derive the same advantages from it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There are still a few old professors in Palo Alto, but one by

How many times have you read about startup founders who continued
to live inexpensively as their companies took off?  Who continued
to dress in jeans and t-shirts, to drive the old car they had in
grad school, and so on?  If you did that in New York, people would
treat you like shit.  If you walk into a fancy restaurant in San
Francisco wearing a jeans and a t-shirt, they&apos;re nice to you; who
knows who you might be?  Not in New York.<br><br>One sign of a city&apos;s potential as a technology center is the number
of restaurants that still require jackets for men.  According to
Zagat&apos;s there are none in San Francisco, LA, Boston, or Seattle, 
4 in DC, 6 in Chicago, 8 in London, 13 in New York, and 20 in Paris.<br><br>(Zagat&apos;s lists the Ritz Carlton Dining Room in SF as requiring jackets
but I couldn&apos;t believe it, so I called to check and in fact they
don&apos;t. Apparently there&apos;s only one restaurant left on the entire West
Coast that still requires jackets: The French Laundry in Napa Valley.)<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Ideas are one step upstream from economic power, so it&apos;s
conceivable that intellectual centers like Cambridge will one day
have an edge over Silicon Valley like the one the Valley has over
New York.<br><br>This seems unlikely at the moment; if anything Boston is falling
further and further behind.  The only reason I even mention the
possibility is that the path from ideas to startups has recently
been getting smoother.  It&apos;s a lot easier now for a couple of hackers
with no business experience to start a startup than it was 10 years
ago.  If you extrapolate another 20 years, maybe the balance of
power will start to shift back.  I wouldn&apos;t bet on it, but I wouldn&apos;t
bet against it either.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
If Paris is where people care most about art, why is New York
the center of gravity of the art business?  Because in the twentieth
century, art as brand split apart from art as stuff.  New York is
where the richest buyers are, but all they demand from art is brand,
and since you can base brand on anything with a sufficiently
identifiable style, you may as well use the local stuff.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston,

 <a href="http://www.omnisio.com/startupschool08/david-heinemeier-hansson-at-startup-school-08">talk</a>
in which he suggested that startup founders
should do things the old fashioned way.  Instead of hoping to get
rich by building a valuable company and then selling stock in a
&quot;liquidity event,&quot; founders should start companies that make money
and live off the revenues.<br><br>Sounds like a good plan.  Let&apos;s think about the optimal way to do
this.<br><br>One disadvantage of living off the revenues of your company is that
you have to keep running it.  And as anyone who runs their own
business can tell you, that requires your complete attention.  You
can&apos;t just start a business and check out once things are going
well, or they stop going well surprisingly fast.<br><br>The main economic motives of startup founders seem to be freedom
and security.  They want enough money that (a) they don&apos;t have to
worry about running out of money and (b) they can spend their time
how they want.  Running your own business offers neither.  You
certainly don&apos;t have freedom: no boss is so demanding.  Nor do you
have security, because if you stop paying attention to the company,
its revenues go away, and with them your income.<br><br>The best case, for most people, would be if you could hire someone
to manage the company for you once you&apos;d grown it to a certain size.
Suppose you could find a really good manager.  Then you would have
both freedom and security.  You could pay as little attention to
the business as you wanted, knowing that your manager would keep
things running smoothly.  And that being so, revenues would continue
to flow in, so you&apos;d have security as well.<br><br>There will of course be some founders who wouldn&apos;t like that idea:
the ones who like running their company so much that there&apos;s nothing
else they&apos;d rather do.  But this group must be small.  The way you
succeed in most businesses is to be fanatically attentive
to customers&apos; needs.  What are the odds that your own desires would
coincide exactly with the demands of this powerful, external force?<br><br>Sure, running your own company can be fairly interesting.  Viaweb
was more interesting than any job I&apos;d had before.  And since I made
much more money from it, it offered the highest ratio of income to
boringness of anything I&apos;d done, by orders of magnitude.  But was
it <i>the</i> most interesting work I could imagine doing?  No.<br><br>Whether the number of founders in the same position is asymptotic
or merely large, there are certainly a lot of them.  For them the
right approach would be to hand the company over to a professional
manager eventually, if they could find one who was good enough.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>So far so good.  But what if your manager was hit by a bus?  What
you really want is a management company to run your company for
you.  Then you don&apos;t depend on any one person.<br><br>If you own rental property, there are companies you can hire to
manage it for you.  Some will do everything, from finding tenants
to fixing leaks.  Of course, running companies is a lot more
complicated than managing rental property, but let&apos;s suppose there
were management companies that could do it for you. They&apos;d charge
a lot, but wouldn&apos;t it be worth it?  I&apos;d sacrifice a large percentage
of the income for the extra peace of mind.<br><br>I realize what I&apos;m describing already sounds too good to be true, but I
can think of a way to make it even more attractive.  If
company management companies existed, there would be an additional
service they could offer clients: they could let them insure their
returns by pooling their risk.  After all, even a perfect manager can&apos;t save a company
when, as sometimes happens, its whole market dies, just as property
managers can&apos;t save you from the building burning down.  But a
company that managed a large enough number of companies could say
to all its clients: we&apos;ll combine the revenues from all your
companies, and pay you your proportionate share.<br><br>If such management companies existed, they&apos;d offer the maximum of
freedom and security.  Someone would run your company for you, and
you&apos;d be protected even if it happened to die.<br><br>Let&apos;s think about how such a management company might be organized.
The simplest way would be to have a new kind of stock representing
the total pool of companies they were managing.  When you signed
up, you&apos;d trade your company&apos;s stock for shares of this pool, in
proportion to an estimate of your company&apos;s value that you&apos;d both
agreed upon.  Then you&apos;d automatically get your share of the returns
of the whole pool.<br><br>The catch is that because this kind of trade would be hard to undo,
you couldn&apos;t switch management companies.  But there&apos;s a way they
could fix that: suppose all the company management companies got
together and agreed to allow their clients to exchange shares in
all their pools.  Then you could, in effect, simultaneously choose
all the management companies to run yours for you, in whatever
proportion you wanted, and change your mind later as often as you
wanted.<br><br>If such pooled-risk company management companies existed, signing
up with one would seem the ideal plan for most people following the
route David advocated.<br><br>Good news: they do exist.  What I&apos;ve just
described is an acquisition by a public company.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Unfortunately, though public acquirers are structurally identical
to pooled-risk company management companies, they don&apos;t think of
themselves that way.  With a property management company, you can
just walk in whenever you want and say &quot;manage my rental property
for me&quot; and they&apos;ll do it.  Whereas acquirers are, as of this
writing, extremely fickle.  Sometimes they&apos;re in a buying mood and
they&apos;ll overpay enormously; other times they&apos;re not interested.
They&apos;re like property management companies run by madmen.  Or more
precisely, by Benjamin Graham&apos;s Mr. Market.<br><br>So while on average public acquirers behave like pooled-risk company
managers, you need a window of several years to get average case
performance.  If you wait long enough (five years, say) you&apos;re
likely to hit an up cycle where some acquirer is hot to buy you.
But you can&apos;t choose when it happens.<br><br>You can&apos;t assume investors will carry you for as long as you might
have to wait. Your company has to make money.  Opinions are divided
about how early to focus on that.  
<a href="http://susanitsa.wordpress.com/2006/11/08/the-joe-kraus-qa-better-late/">Joe Kraus</a> says you should try
charging customers right away.  And yet some of the most successful
startups, including Google, ignored revenue at first and concentrated
exclusively on development.  The answer probably depends on the
type of company you&apos;re starting.  I can imagine some where trying
to make sales would be a good heuristic for product design, and
others where it would just be a distraction.  The test is probably
whether it helps you to understand your users.<br><br>You can choose whichever revenue strategy you think is best for the
type of company you&apos;re starting, so long as you&apos;re profitable.
Being profitable ensures you&apos;ll get at least the average of the
acquisition market&#x2014;in which public companies do behave as pooled-risk
company management companies.<br><br>David isn&apos;t mistaken in saying you should start a company to live
off its revenues.  The mistake is thinking this is somehow opposed
to starting a company and selling it.  In fact, for most people the
latter is merely the optimal case of the former.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Michael

<p>
August 2008<br><br>Raising money is the second hardest part of starting a startup.
The hardest part is making something people want: most startups
that die, die because they didn&apos;t do that.  But the second biggest
cause of death is probably the difficulty of raising money.
Fundraising is brutal.<br><br>One reason it&apos;s so brutal is simply the brutality of markets.  People
who&apos;ve spent most of their lives in schools or big companies may
not have been exposed to that.  Professors and bosses usually feel
some sense of responsibility toward you; if you make a valiant
effort and fail, they&apos;ll cut you a break.  Markets are less forgiving.
Customers don&apos;t care how hard you worked, only whether you solved
their problems.<br><br>Investors evaluate startups the way customers evaluate products,
not the way bosses evaluate employees.  If you&apos;re making a valiant
effort and failing, maybe they&apos;ll invest in your next startup, but
not this one.<br><br>But raising money from investors is harder than selling to
customers, because there are so few of them.  There&apos;s
nothing like an efficient market.  You&apos;re unlikely to have more
than 10 who are interested; it&apos;s difficult to talk to more.  So the
randomness of any one investor&apos;s behavior can really affect you.<br><br>Problem number 3: investors are very random.  All investors, including
us, are by ordinary standards incompetent.  We constantly have to
make decisions about things we don&apos;t understand, and more often
than not we&apos;re wrong.<br><br>And yet a lot is at stake.  The amounts invested by different types
of investors vary from five thousand dollars to fifty million, but
the amount usually seems large for whatever type of investor it is.
Investment decisions are big decisions.<br><br>That combination&#x2014;making big decisions about things they don&apos;t
understand&#x2014;tends to make investors very skittish.  VCs are notorious
for leading founders on.  Some of the more unscrupulous do it
deliberately.  But even the most well-intentioned investors can
behave in a way that would seem crazy in everyday life.  One day
they&apos;re full of enthusiasm and seem ready to write you a check on
the spot; the next they won&apos;t return your phone calls.  They&apos;re not
playing games with you.  They just can&apos;t make up their minds.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>If that weren&apos;t bad enough, these wildly fluctuating nodes are all
linked together.  Startup investors all know one another, and (though
they hate to admit it) the biggest factor in their opinion of you
is the opinion of other investors.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Talk about a recipe for
an unstable system.  You get the opposite of the damping that the
fear/greed balance usually produces in markets.  No one is interested
in a startup that&apos;s a &quot;bargain&quot; because everyone else hates it.<br><br>So the inefficient market you get because there are so few players
is exacerbated by the fact that they act less than independently.
The result is a system like some kind of primitive, multi-celled
sea creature, where you irritate one extremity and the whole thing
contracts violently.<br><br>Y Combinator is working to fix this.  We&apos;re trying to increase the
number of investors just as we&apos;re increasing the number of startups.
We hope that as the number of both increases we&apos;ll get something
more like an efficient market.  As t approaches infinity, Demo Day
approaches an auction.<br><br>Unfortunately, t is still very far from infinity.  What does a
startup do now, in the imperfect world we currently inhabit? The
most important thing is not to let fundraising get you down.  Startups
live or die on morale.  If you let the difficulty of raising money
destroy your morale, it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br><br>
<b>Bootstrapping (= Consulting)</b><br><br>Some would-be founders may by now be thinking, why deal with investors
at all?  If raising money is so painful, why do it?<br><br>One answer to that is obvious: because you need money to live on.
It&apos;s a fine idea in principle to finance your startup with its own
revenues, but you can&apos;t create instant customers.  Whatever you
make, you have to sell a certain amount to break even.  It will
take time to grow your sales to that point, and it&apos;s hard to predict,
till you try, how long it will take.<br><br>We could not have bootstrapped Viaweb, for example.  We charged
quite a lot for our software&#x2014;about $140 per user per month&#x2014;but
it was at least a year before our revenues would have covered even
our paltry costs.  We didn&apos;t have enough saved to live on for a
year.<br><br>If you factor out the &quot;bootstrapped&quot; companies that were actually
funded by their founders through savings or a day job, the remainder
either (a) got really lucky, which is hard to do on demand, or (b)
began life as consulting companies and gradually transformed
themselves into product companies.<br><br>Consulting is the only option you can count on.  But consulting is
far from free money.  It&apos;s not as painful as raising money from
investors, perhaps, but the pain is spread over a longer period.
Years, probably.  And for many types of startup, that delay could
be fatal.  If you&apos;re working on something so unusual that no one
else is likely to think of it, you can take your time.  Joshua
Schachter gradually built Delicious on the side while working on
Wall Street.  He got away with it because no one else realized it
was a good idea.  But if you were building something as obviously
necessary as online store software at about the same time as Viaweb,
and you were working on it on the side while spending most of your
time on client work, you were not in a good position.<br><br>Bootstrapping sounds great in principle, but this apparently verdant
territory is one from which few startups emerge alive.  The mere
fact that bootstrapped startups tend to be famous on that account
should set off alarm bells.  If it worked so well, it would be the
norm.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>
Bootstrapping may get easier, because starting a company is getting
cheaper.  But I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll ever reach the point where most
startups can do without outside funding.  Technology tends to
get dramatically cheaper, but living expenses don&apos;t.<br><br>The upshot is, you can choose your pain: either the short, sharp
pain of raising money, or the chronic ache of consulting.  For a
given total amount of pain, raising money is the better choice,
because new technology is usually more valuable now than later.<br><br>But although for most startups raising money will be the lesser
evil, it&apos;s still a pretty big evil&#x2014;so big that it can easily kill
you.  Not merely in the obvious sense that if you fail to raise
money you might have to shut the company down, but because the
<i>process</i> of raising money itself can kill you.<br><br>To survive it you need a set of techniques mostly
orthogonal to the ones used in convincing investors, just as mountain
climbers need to know survival techniques that are mostly orthogonal
to those used in physically getting up and down mountains.<br><br>
<b>1. Have low expectations.</b><br><br>The reason raising money destroys so many startups&apos; morale is not
simply that it&apos;s hard, but that it&apos;s so much harder than they
expected.  What kills you is the disappointment.  And the lower
your expectations, the harder it is to be disappointed.<br><br>Startup founders tend to be optimistic.  This can work well in
technology, at least some of the time, but it&apos;s the wrong way to
approach raising money.  Better to assume investors will always let
you down.  Acquirers too, while we&apos;re at it.  At YC one of our
secondary mantras is &quot;Deals fall through.&quot;  No matter what deal
you have going on, assume it will fall through.  The predictive
power of this simple rule is amazing.<br><br>There will be a tendency, as a deal progresses, to start to believe
it will happen, and then to depend on it happening.  You must resist
this.  Tie yourself to the mast.  This is what kills you.  Deals
do not have a trajectory like most other human interactions, where
shared plans solidify linearly over time.  Deals often fall through
at the last moment.  Often the other party doesn&apos;t really think
about what they want till the last moment.  So you can&apos;t use your
everyday intuitions about shared plans as a guide.  When it comes
to deals, you have to consciously turn them off and become
pathologically cynical.<br><br>This is harder to do than it sounds.  It&apos;s very flattering when
eminent investors seem interested in funding you.  It&apos;s easy to
start to believe that raising money will be quick and straightforward.
But it hardly ever is.<br><br>
<b>2. Keep working on your startup.</b><br><br>It sounds obvious to say that you should keep working on your startup
while raising money.  Actually this is hard to do.  Most startups
don&apos;t manage to.<br><br>Raising money has a mysterious capacity to suck up all your attention.
Even if you only have one meeting a day with investors, somehow
that one meeting will burn up your whole day.  It costs not just
the time of the actual meeting, but the time getting there and back,
and the time preparing for it beforehand and thinking about it
afterward.<br><br>The best way to survive the distraction of meeting with investors
is probably to partition the company: to pick one founder to deal
with investors while the others keep the company going.  This works
better when a startup has 3 founders than 2, and better when the
leader of the company is not also the lead developer.  In the best
case, the company keeps moving forward at about half speed.<br><br>That&apos;s the best case, though.  More often than not the company comes
to a standstill while raising money.  And that is dangerous for so
many reasons.  Raising money always takes longer than you expect.
What seems like it&apos;s going to be a 2 week interruption turns into
a 4 month interruption.  That can be very demoralizing.  And worse
still, it can make you less attractive to investors.  They want to
invest in companies that are dynamic.  A company that hasn&apos;t done
anything new in 4 months doesn&apos;t seem dynamic, so they start to
lose interest.  Investors rarely grasp this, but much of what
they&apos;re responding to when they lose interest in a startup is the
damage done by their own indecision.<br><br>The solution: put the startup first.  Fit meetings with investors
into the spare moments in your development schedule, rather than
doing development in the spare moments between meetings with
investors.  If you keep the company moving forward&#x2014;releasing new
features, increasing traffic, doing deals, getting written 
about&#x2014;those investor meetings are more likely to be productive.  Not just
because your startup will seem more alive, but also because it will
be better for your own morale, which is one of the main ways investors
judge you.<br><br>
<b>3. Be conservative.</b><br><br>As conditions get worse, the optimal strategy becomes more conservative.
When things go well you can take risks; when things are bad you
want to play it safe.<br><br>I advise approaching fundraising as if it were always going badly.
The reason is that between your ability to delude yourself and the
wildly unstable nature of the system you&apos;re dealing with, things
probably either already are or could easily become much worse than
they seem.<br><br>What I tell most startups we fund is that if someone reputable
offers you funding on reasonable terms, take it.  There have been
startups that ignored this advice and got away with it&#x2014;startups
that ignored a good offer in the hope of getting a better one, and
actually did.  But in the same position I&apos;d give the same advice
again.  Who knows how many bullets were in the gun they were playing
Russian roulette with?<br><br>Corollary: if an investor seems interested, don&apos;t just let them
sit. You can&apos;t assume someone interested in investing will stay
interested.  In fact, you can&apos;t even tell (<i>they</i> can&apos;t even tell)
if they&apos;re really interested till you try to convert that interest
into money.  So if you have hot prospect, either close them now or
write them off.  And unless you already have enough funding, that
reduces to: close them now.<br><br>Startups don&apos;t win by getting great funding rounds, but by making
great products.  So finish raising money and get
back to work.<br><br>
<b>4. Be flexible.</b><br><br>There are two questions VCs ask that you shouldn&apos;t answer: &quot;Who
else are you talking to?&quot; and &quot;How much are you trying to raise?&quot;<br><br>VCs don&apos;t expect you to answer the first question. They ask it just
in case. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
They do seem to expect an answer to the second.  But
I don&apos;t think you should just tell them a number.  Not as a way to
play games with them, but because you shouldn&apos;t <i>have</i> a fixed
amount you need to raise.<br><br>The custom of a startup needing a fixed amount of funding is an
obsolete one left over from the days when startups were more
expensive.  A company that needed to build a factory or hire 50
people obviously needed to raise a certain minimum amount.  But few
technology startups are in that position today.<br><br>We advise startups to tell investors there are several different
routes they could take depending on how much they raised.  As little
as $50k could pay for food and rent for the founders for a year.
A couple hundred thousand would let them get office space and hire
some smart people they know from school.  A couple million would
let them really blow this thing out.  The message (and not just the
message, but the fact) should be: we&apos;re going to succeed no matter
what.  Raising more money just lets us do it faster.<br><br>If you&apos;re raising an angel round, the size of the round can even
change on the fly.  In fact, it&apos;s just as well to make the round
small initially, then expand as needed, rather than trying to raise
a large round and risk losing the investors you already have if you
can&apos;t raise the full amount.  You may even want to do a &quot;rolling
close,&quot; where the round has no predetermined size, but instead you
sell stock to investors one at a time as they say yes.  That helps
break deadlocks, because you can start as soon as the first one
is ready to buy. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>5. Be independent.</b><br><br>A startup with a couple founders in their early twenties can have
expenses so low that they could be profitable on
as little as $2000 per month.  That&apos;s negligible as corporate
revenues go, but the effect on your morale and your bargaining
position is anything but.  At YC we use the phrase &quot;ramen profitable&quot;
to describe the situation where you&apos;re making just enough to pay
your living expenses.  Once you cross into ramen profitable,
everything changes.  You may still need investment to make it big,
but you don&apos;t need it this month.<br><br>You can&apos;t plan when you start a startup how long
it will take to become profitable.  But if you find yourself in a
position where a little more effort expended on sales would carry
you over the threshold of ramen profitable, do it.<br><br>Investors like it when you&apos;re ramen profitable.  It shows you&apos;ve
thought about making money, instead of just working on amusing
technical problems; it shows you have the discipline to keep your
expenses low; but above all, it means you don&apos;t need them.<br><br>There is nothing investors like more than a startup that seems like
it&apos;s going to succeed even without them.  Investors like it when
they can help a startup, but they don&apos;t like startups that would
die without that help.<br><br>At YC we spend a lot of time trying to predict how the startups we&apos;ve
funded will do, because we&apos;re trying to learn how to pick winners.
We&apos;ve now watched the trajectories of so many startups that we&apos;re
getting better at predicting them.  And when we&apos;re talking
about startups we think are likely to succeed, what we find ourselves
saying is things like &quot;Oh, those guys can take care of themselves.
They&apos;ll be fine.&quot; Not &quot;those guys are really smart&quot; or
&quot;those guys are working on a great idea.&quot;
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font>
When we predict good outcomes for startups, the qualities
that come up in the supporting arguments are toughness, adaptability,
determination.  Which means to the extent we&apos;re correct, those are
the qualities you need to win.<br><br>Investors know this, at least unconsciously.   The reason they like
it when you don&apos;t need them is not simply that they like what they
can&apos;t have, but because that quality is what makes founders succeed.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhId_WG7RA">Sam Altman</a> 
has it.  You could parachute him into an island full of
cannibals and come back in 5 years and he&apos;d be the king.  If you&apos;re
Sam Altman, you don&apos;t have to be profitable to convey to investors
that you&apos;ll succeed with or without them.  (He wasn&apos;t, and he did.)
Not everyone has Sam&apos;s deal-making ability.  I myself don&apos;t.  But
if you don&apos;t, you can let the numbers speak for you.<br><br>
<b>6. Don&apos;t take rejection personally.</b><br><br>Getting rejected by investors can make you start to doubt yourself.
After all, they&apos;re more experienced than you.  If they think your
startup is lame, aren&apos;t they probably right?<br><br>Maybe, maybe not.  The way to handle rejection is with precision.
You shouldn&apos;t simply ignore rejection.  It might mean something.
But you shouldn&apos;t automatically get demoralized either.<br><br>To understand what rejection means, you have to understand first
of all how common it is.  Statistically, the average VC is a rejection
machine.  David Hornik, a partner at August, told me:
<blockquote>
  The numbers for me ended up being something like 500 to 800 plans
  received and read, somewhere between 50 and 100 initial 1 hour
  meetings held, about 20 companies that I got interested in, about
  5 that I got serious about and did a bunch of work, 1 to 2 deals
  done in a year.  So the odds are against you.  You
  may be a great entrepreneur, working on interesting stuff, etc.
  but it is still incredibly unlikely that you get funded.
</blockquote>
This is less true with angels, but VCs reject practically everyone.
The structure of their business means a partner does at most 2 new
investments a year, no matter how many good startups approach him.<br><br>In addition to the odds being terrible, the average investor is,
as I mentioned, a pretty bad judge of startups.  It&apos;s harder to
judge startups than most other things, because great startup ideas
tend to seem wrong. A good startup idea has to be not just good but
novel.  And to be both good and novel, an idea probably has to seem
bad to most people, or someone would already be doing it and it
wouldn&apos;t be novel.<br><br>That makes judging startups harder than most other things one judges.
You have to be an intellectual contrarian to be a good startup
investor.  That&apos;s a problem for VCs, most of whom are not particularly
imaginative.  VCs are mostly money guys, not people who make things.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
Angels are better at appreciating novel ideas, because most
were founders themselves.<br><br>So when you get a rejection, use the data that&apos;s in it, and not what&apos;s
not.  If an investor gives you specific reasons for not investing,
look at your startup and ask if they&apos;re right.  If they&apos;re real
problems, fix them.  But don&apos;t just take their word for it.  You&apos;re
supposed to be the domain expert; you have to decide.<br><br>Though a rejection doesn&apos;t necessarily tell you anything about your
startup, it does suggest your pitch could be improved.  Figure out
what&apos;s not working and change it.  Don&apos;t just think &quot;investors are
stupid.&quot;  Often they are, but figure out precisely where you lose
them.<br><br>Don&apos;t let rejections pile up as a depressing, undifferentiated heap.
Sort them and analyze them, and then instead of thinking &quot;no one
likes us,&quot; you&apos;ll know precisely how big a problem you have, and
what to do about it.<br><br>
<b>7. Be able to downshift into consulting (if appropriate).</b><br><br>Consulting, as I mentioned, is a dangerous way to finance a startup.
But it&apos;s better than dying.  It&apos;s a bit like anaerobic respiration:
not the optimum solution for the long term, but it can save you
from an immediate threat.  If you&apos;re having trouble raising money
from investors at all, it could save you to be able to shift
toward consulting.<br><br>This works better for some startups than others.  It wouldn&apos;t have
been a natural fit for, say, Google, but if your company was making
software for building web sites, you could degrade fairly gracefully
into consulting by building sites for clients with it.<br><br>So long as you were careful not to get sucked permanently into
consulting, this could even have advantages.  You&apos;d understand your
users well if you were using the software for them.  Plus as a
consulting company you might be able to get big-name users using
your software that you wouldn&apos;t have gotten as a product company.<br><br>At Viaweb we were forced to operate like a consulting company
initially, because we were so desperate for users that we&apos;d offer
to build merchants&apos; sites for them if they&apos;d sign up. 
But we never charged for such work, because we didn&apos;t want them to
start treating us like actual consultants, and calling us every
time they wanted something changed on their site.  We knew we had
to stay a product company, because only
that scales.<br><br>
<b>8. Avoid inexperienced investors.</b><br><br>Though novice investors seem unthreatening they can be the most
dangerous sort, because they&apos;re so nervous.  Especially in
proportion to the amount they invest.  Raising $20,000 from a first-time
angel investor can be as much work as raising $2 million from
a VC fund.<br><br>Their lawyers are generally inexperienced too.  But while the
investors can admit they don&apos;t know what they&apos;re doing, their lawyers
can&apos;t.  One YC startup negotiated terms for a tiny round with
an angel, only to receive a 70-page agreement from his lawyer.  And
since the lawyer could never admit, in front of his client, that
he&apos;d screwed up, he instead had to insist on retaining all the
draconian terms in it, so the deal fell through.<br><br>Of course, someone has to take money from novice investors, or there
would never be any experienced ones.  But if you do, either (a)
drive the process yourself, including supplying the 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html">paperwork</a>, or
(b) use them only to fill up a larger round led by someone else.<br><br>
<b>9. Know where you stand.</b><br><br>The most dangerous thing about investors is their indecisiveness.
The worst case scenario is the long no, the no that comes after
months of meetings.  Rejections from investors are like design
flaws: inevitable, but much less costly if you discover them early.<br><br>So while you&apos;re talking to investors, constantly look for signs of
where you stand.  How likely are they to offer you a term sheet?
What do they have to be convinced of first?  You shouldn&apos;t necessarily
always be asking these questions outright&#x2014;that could get 
annoying&#x2014;but you should always be collecting data about them.<br><br>Investors tend to resist committing except to the extent you push
them to.  It&apos;s in their interest to collect the maximum amount of
information while making the minimum number of decisions.  The best
way to force them to act is, of course, competing investors.  But
you can also apply some force by focusing the discussion:
by asking what specific questions they need answered to make
up their minds, and then answering them.  If you get through several
obstacles and they keep raising new ones, assume that ultimately
they&apos;re going to flake.<br><br>You have to be disciplined when collecting data about investors&apos;
intentions.  Otherwise their desire to lead you on will combine
with your own desire to be led on to produce completely inaccurate
impressions.<br><br>Use the data to weight your strategy.
You&apos;ll probably be talking to several investors.  Focus on the ones
that are most likely to say yes.  The value of a potential investor
is a combination of how good it would be if they said yes, and how
likely they are to say it.  Put the most weight on the second factor.
Partly because the most important quality in an investor is simply
investing.  But also because, as I mentioned, the biggest factor
in investors&apos; opinion of you is other investors&apos; opinion of you.
If you&apos;re talking to several investors and you manage to get one
over the threshold of saying yes, it will make the others much more
interested.  So you&apos;re not sacrificing the lukewarm investors if
you focus on the hot ones; convincing the hot investors is the best
way to convince the lukewarm ones.<br><br>
<b>Future</b><br><br>I&apos;m hopeful things won&apos;t always be so awkward. I hope that as startups
get cheaper and the number of investors increases, raising money
will become, if not easy, at least straightforward.<br><br>In the meantime, the brokenness of the funding process offers a big
opportunity.  Most investors have no idea how dangerous they are.
They&apos;d be surprised to hear that raising money from them is something
that has to be treated as a threat to a company&apos;s survival.  They
just think they need a little more information to make up their
minds.  They don&apos;t get that there are 10 other investors who also
want a little more information, and that the process of talking to
them all can bring a startup to a standstill for months.<br><br>Because investors don&apos;t understand the cost of dealing with them,
they don&apos;t realize how much room there is for a potential competitor
to undercut them.  I know from my own experience how much faster
investors could decide, because we&apos;ve brought our own time down to
20 minutes (5 minutes of reading an application plus a 10 minute
interview plus 5 minutes of discussion).  If you were investing
more money you&apos;d want to take longer, of course.  But if we can
decide in 20 minutes, should it take anyone longer than a couple
days?<br><br>Opportunities like this don&apos;t sit unexploited forever, even in an
industry as conservative as venture capital.  So
either existing investors will start to make up their minds faster,
or new investors will emerge who do.<br><br>In the meantime founders have to treat raising money as a dangerous
process.  Fortunately, I can fix the biggest danger right here.
The biggest danger is surprise.  It&apos;s that startups will underestimate
the difficulty of raising money&#x2014;that they&apos;ll cruise through all
the initial steps, but when they turn to raising money they&apos;ll find
it surprisingly hard, get demoralized, and give up. So I&apos;m telling
you in advance: raising money is hard.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
When investors can&apos;t make up their minds, they sometimes
describe it as if it were a property of the startup.  &quot;You&apos;re too
early for us,&quot; they sometimes say.  But which of them, if they were
taken back in a time machine to the hour Google was founded, wouldn&apos;t
offer to invest at any valuation the founders chose?  An hour old
is not too early if it&apos;s the right startup.  What &quot;you&apos;re too early&quot;
really means is &quot;we can&apos;t figure out yet whether you&apos;ll succeed.&quot;<br><br>
[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Investors influence one another both directly and indirectly.
They influence one another directly through the &quot;buzz&quot; that surrounds
a hot startup.  But they also influence one another indirectly
<i>through the founders.</i>  When a lot of investors are interested in
you, it increases your confidence in a way that makes you much more
attractive to investors.<br><br>No VC will admit they&apos;re influenced by buzz.  Some genuinely aren&apos;t.
But there are few who can say they&apos;re not influenced by confidence.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
One VC who read this essay wrote:<br><br>&quot;We try to avoid companies that got bootstrapped with consulting. 
It creates very bad behaviors/instincts that are hard to erase 
from a company&apos;s culture.&quot;<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
The optimal way to answer the first question is to say that
it would be improper to name names, while simultaneously implying
that you&apos;re talking to a bunch of other VCs who are all about to
give you term sheets.  If you&apos;re the sort of person who understands
how to do that, go ahead.  If not, don&apos;t even try.  Nothing annoys
VCs more than clumsy efforts to manipulate them.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
The disadvantage of expanding a round on the fly is that the
valuation is fixed at the start, so if you get a sudden rush of
interest, you may have to decide between turning some investors
away and selling more of the company than you meant to.  That&apos;s a
good problem to have, however.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
I wouldn&apos;t say that intelligence doesn&apos;t matter in startups.
We&apos;re only comparing YC startups, who&apos;ve already made it over a
certain threshold.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
But not all are.  Though most VCs are suits at heart,
the most successful ones tend not to be.  Oddly enough,
the best VCs tend to be the least VC-like.<br><br>

<p>
October 2008<br><br>The economic situation is apparently so grim that some experts fear
we may be in for a stretch as bad as the mid seventies.<br><br>When Microsoft and Apple were founded.<br><br>As those examples suggest, a recession may not be such a bad time
to start a startup.  I&apos;m not claiming it&apos;s a particularly good time
either.  The truth is more boring: the state of the economy doesn&apos;t
matter much either way.<br><br>If we&apos;ve learned one thing from funding so many startups, it&apos;s that
they succeed or fail based on the qualities of the founders.  The
economy has some effect, certainly, but as a predictor of success
it&apos;s rounding error compared to the founders.<br><br>Which means that what matters is who you are, not when you do it.
If you&apos;re the right sort of person, you&apos;ll win even in a bad economy.
And if you&apos;re not, a good economy won&apos;t save you.  Someone who
thinks &quot;I better not start a startup now, because the economy is
so bad&quot; is making the same mistake as the people who thought during
the Bubble &quot;all I have to do is start a startup, and I&apos;ll be rich.&quot;<br><br>So if you want to improve your chances, you should think far more
about who you can recruit as a cofounder than the state of the
economy.  And if you&apos;re worried about threats to the survival of
your company, don&apos;t look for them in the news.  Look in the mirror.<br><br>But for any given team of founders, would it not pay to wait till
the economy is better before taking the leap?  If you&apos;re starting
a restaurant, maybe, but not if you&apos;re working on technology.
Technology progresses more or less independently of the stock market.
So for any given idea, the payoff for acting fast in a bad economy
will be higher than for waiting.  Microsoft&apos;s first product was a
Basic interpreter for the Altair.  That was exactly what the world
needed in 1975, but if Gates and Allen had decided to wait a few
years, it would have been too late.<br><br>Of course, the idea you have now won&apos;t be the last you have.  There
are always new ideas.  But if you have a specific idea you want to
act on, act now.<br><br>That doesn&apos;t mean you can ignore the economy.  Both customers and investors
will be feeling pinched.  It&apos;s not necessarily a problem if customers
feel pinched: you may even be able to benefit from it, by making
things that <a href="http://bountii.com">save money</a>.  
Startups often make things cheaper, so in
that respect they&apos;re better positioned to prosper in a recession
than big companies.<br><br>Investors are more of a problem.  Startups generally need to raise
some amount of external funding, and investors tend to be less
willing to invest in bad times.  They shouldn&apos;t be.  Everyone knows
you&apos;re supposed to buy when times are bad and sell when times are
good.  But of course what makes investing so counterintuitive is
that in equity markets, good times are defined as everyone thinking
it&apos;s time to buy.  You have to be a contrarian to be correct, and
by definition only a minority of investors can be.<br><br>So just as investors in 1999 were tripping over one another trying
to buy into lousy startups, investors in 2009 will presumably be
reluctant to invest even in good ones.<br><br>You&apos;ll have to adapt to this.  But that&apos;s nothing new: startups
always have to adapt to the whims of investors.  Ask any founder
in any economy if they&apos;d describe investors as fickle, and watch
the face they make.  Last year you had to be prepared to explain
how your startup was viral.  Next year you&apos;ll have to explain how
it&apos;s recession-proof.<br><br>(Those are both good things to be.  The mistake investors make is
not the criteria they use but that they always tend to focus on one
to the exclusion of the rest.)<br><br>Fortunately the way to make a startup recession-proof is to do
exactly what you should do anyway: run it as cheaply as possible.
For years I&apos;ve been telling founders that the surest route to success
is to be the cockroaches of the corporate world.  The immediate
cause of death in a startup is always running out of money. So the
cheaper your company is to operate, the harder it is to kill.
And fortunately it has gotten very cheap to run a startup. A recession
will if anything make it cheaper still.<br><br>If nuclear winter really is here, it may be safer to be a cockroach
even than to keep your job.  Customers may drop off individually
if they can no longer afford you, but you&apos;re not going to lose them
all at once; markets don&apos;t &quot;reduce headcount.&quot;<br><br>What if you quit your job to start a startup that fails, and you
can&apos;t find another?  That could be a problem if you work in sales or
marketing.  In those fields it can take months to find a new
job in a bad economy.  But hackers seem to be more liquid.  Good
hackers can always get some kind of job.  It might not be your dream
job, but you&apos;re not going to starve.<br><br>Another advantage of bad times is that there&apos;s less competition.
Technology trains leave the station at regular intervals.  If 
everyone else is cowering in a corner, you may have a whole car to
yourself.<br><br>You&apos;re an investor too.  As a founder, you&apos;re buying stock with
work: the reason Larry and Sergey are so rich is not so much that
they&apos;ve done work worth tens of billions of dollars, but that they
were the first investors in Google.  And like any investor you
should buy when times are bad.<br><br>Were you nodding in agreement, thinking &quot;stupid investors&quot; a few
paragraphs ago when I was talking about how investors are reluctant
to put money into startups in bad markets, even though that&apos;s the
time they should rationally be most willing to buy?  Well, founders
aren&apos;t much better.  When times get bad, hackers go to grad school.
And no doubt that will happen this time too.  In fact, what makes
the preceding paragraph true is that most readers won&apos;t believe
it&#x2014;at least to the extent of acting on it.<br><br>So maybe a recession is a good time to start a startup.  It&apos;s hard
to say whether advantages like lack of competition outweigh
disadvantages like reluctant investors.  But it doesn&apos;t matter much
either way.   It&apos;s the people that matter.  And for a given set of
people working on a given technology, the time to act is always
now.<br><br></p></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://spring.jumpidea.com/2008/10/paul-graham-badeconomy.html">Russian Translation</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="artistsship">The Other Half of &quot;Artists Ship&quot;  </h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">November 2008<br><br>One of the differences between big companies and startups is that
big companies tend to have developed procedures to protect themselves
against mistakes.  A startup walks like a toddler, bashing
into things and falling over all the time.  A big company is more
deliberate.<br><br>The gradual accumulation of checks in an organization is a kind of
learning, based on disasters that have happened to it or others
like it.  After giving a contract to a supplier who goes bankrupt
and fails to deliver, for example, a company might require all
suppliers to prove they&apos;re solvent before submitting bids.<br><br>As companies grow they invariably get more such checks, either in
response to disasters they&apos;ve suffered, or (probably more often)
by hiring people from bigger companies who bring with them customs
for protecting against new types of disasters.<br><br>It&apos;s natural for organizations to learn from mistakes.  The problem
is, people who propose new checks almost never consider that the
check itself has a cost.<br><br><i>Every check has a cost.</i> For example, consider the case of making
suppliers verify their solvency.  Surely that&apos;s mere prudence?  But
in fact it could have substantial costs.  There&apos;s obviously the
direct cost in time of the people on both sides who supply and check
proofs of the supplier&apos;s solvency.  But the real costs are the ones
you never hear about: the company that would be the best supplier,
but doesn&apos;t bid because they can&apos;t spare the effort to get verified.
Or the company that would be the best supplier, but falls just short
of the threshold for solvency&#x2014;which will of course have been set
on the high side, since there is no apparent cost of increasing it.<br><br>Whenever someone in an organization proposes to add a new check,
they should have to explain not just the benefit but the cost.  No
matter how bad a job they did of analyzing it, this meta-check would
at least remind everyone there had to <i>be</i> a cost, and send them
looking for it.<br><br>If companies started doing that, they&apos;d find some surprises.  Joel
Spolsky recently spoke at Y Combinator about selling software to
corporate customers.  He said that in most companies software costing
up to about $1000 could be bought by individual managers without
any additional approvals.  Above that threshold, software purchases
generally had to be approved by a committee.  But babysitting this
process was so expensive for software vendors that it didn&apos;t make
sense to charge less than $50,000.  Which means if you&apos;re making
something you might otherwise have charged $5000 for, you have to
sell it for $50,000 instead.<br><br>The purpose of the committee is presumably to ensure that the company
doesn&apos;t waste money. And yet the result is that the company pays
10 times as much.<br><br>Checks on purchases will always be expensive, because the harder
it is to sell something to you, the more it has to cost.  And not
merely linearly, either.  If you&apos;re hard enough to sell to, the
people who are best at making things don&apos;t want to bother.  The
only people who will sell to you are companies that specialize in
selling to you.  Then you&apos;ve sunk to a whole new level of inefficiency.
Market mechanisms no longer protect you, because the good suppliers
are no longer in the market.<br><br>Such things happen constantly to the biggest organizations of all,
governments.  But checks instituted by governments can cause much
worse problems than merely overpaying.  Checks instituted by
governments can cripple a country&apos;s whole economy.  Up till about
1400, China was richer and more technologically advanced than Europe.
One reason Europe pulled ahead was that the Chinese government
restricted long trading voyages.  So it was left to the Europeans
to explore and eventually to dominate the rest of the world, including
China.<br><br>In more recent times, Sarbanes-Oxley has practically destroyed the
US IPO market.  That wasn&apos;t the intention of the legislators who
wrote it.  They just wanted to add a few more checks on public
companies.  But they forgot to consider the cost.  They forgot that
companies about to go public are usually rather stretched, and that
the weight of a few extra checks that might be easy for General
Electric to bear are enough to prevent younger companies from being
public at all.<br><br>Once you start to think about the cost of checks, you can start to
ask other interesting questions. Is the cost increasing or decreasing?
Is it higher in some areas than others?  Where does it increase
discontinuously?  If large organizations started to ask questions
like that, they&apos;d learn some frightening things.<br><br>I think the cost of checks may actually be increasing.  The reason
is that software plays an increasingly important role in companies,
and the people who write software are particularly harmed by checks.<br><br>Programmers are unlike many types of workers in that the best ones
actually prefer to work hard.  This doesn&apos;t seem to be the case in
most types of work.  When I worked in fast food, we didn&apos;t prefer
the busy times.  And when I used to mow lawns, I definitely didn&apos;t
prefer it when the grass was long after a week of rain.<br><br>Programmers, though, like it better when they write more code.  Or
more precisely, when they release more code.  Programmers like to
make a difference.  Good ones, anyway.<br><br>For good programmers, one of the best things about working for a
startup is that there are few checks on releases.  In true startups,
there are no external checks at all.  If you have an idea for a new
feature in the morning, you can write it and push it to the production
servers before lunch.  And when you can do that, you have more
ideas.<br><br>At big companies, software has to go through various approvals
before it can be launched.  And the cost of doing this can be
enormous&#x2014;in fact, discontinuous.  I was talking recently to a
group of three programmers whose startup had been acquired a few
years before by a big company.  When they&apos;d been independent, they
could release changes instantly.  Now, they said, the absolute
fastest they could get code released on the production servers was
two weeks.<br><br>This didn&apos;t merely make them less productive.  It made them hate
working for the acquirer.<br><br>Here&apos;s a sign of how much programmers like to be able to work hard:
these guys would have <i>paid</i> to be able to release code immediately,
the way they used to.  I asked them if they&apos;d trade 10% of the
acquisition price for the ability to release code immediately, and
all three instantly said yes.  Then I asked what was the maximum
percentage of the acquisition price they&apos;d trade for it.  They said
they didn&apos;t want to think about it, because they didn&apos;t want to
know how high they&apos;d go, but I got the impression it might be as
much as half.<br><br>They&apos;d have sacrificed hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps
millions, just to be able to deliver more software to users.  And
you know what?  It would have been perfectly safe to let them.  In
fact, the acquirer would have been better off; not only wouldn&apos;t
these guys have broken anything, they&apos;d have gotten a lot more done.
So the acquirer is in fact getting worse performance at greater
cost.  Just like the committee approving software purchases.<br><br>And just as the greatest danger of being hard to sell to is not
that you overpay but that the best suppliers won&apos;t even sell to
you, the greatest danger of applying too many checks to your
programmers is not that you&apos;ll make them unproductive, but that
good programmers won&apos;t even want to work for you.<br><br>Steve Jobs&apos;s famous maxim &quot;artists ship&quot; works both ways.  Artists
aren&apos;t merely capable of shipping.  They insist on it.  So if you
don&apos;t let people ship, you won&apos;t have any artists.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="highres">The High-Res Society</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">December 2008<br><br>For nearly all of history the success of a society was proportionate
to its ability to assemble large and disciplined organizations.
Those who bet on economies of scale generally won, which meant the
largest organizations were the most successful ones.<br><br>Things have already changed so much that this is hard for us to
believe, but till just a few decades ago the largest organizations
tended to be the most progressive.  An ambitious kid graduating
from college in 1960 wanted to work in the huge, gleaming offices
of Ford, or General Electric, or NASA.  Small meant small-time.
Small in 1960 didn&apos;t mean a cool little startup.  It meant uncle
Sid&apos;s shoe store.<br><br>When I grew up in the 1970s, the idea of the &quot;corporate ladder&quot; was
still very much alive.  The standard plan was to try to get into a
good college, from which one would be drafted into some organization
and then rise to positions of gradually increasing responsibility.
The more ambitious merely hoped to climb the same ladder faster.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>But in the late twentieth century something changed.  It turned out
that economies of scale were not the only force at work.  Particularly
in technology, the increase in speed one could get from smaller
groups started to trump the advantages of size.<br><br>The future turned out to be different from the one we were expecting
in 1970.  The domed cities and flying cars we expected have failed
to materialize.  But fortunately so have the jumpsuits with badges
indicating our specialty and rank.  Instead of being dominated by
a few, giant tree-structured organizations, it&apos;s now looking like
the economy of the future will be a fluid network of smaller,
independent units.<br><br>It&apos;s not so much that large organizations stopped working.  There&apos;s
no evidence that famously successful organizations like the Roman
army or the British East India Company were any less afflicted by
protocol and politics than organizations of the same size today.
But they were competing against opponents who couldn&apos;t change the
rules on the fly by discovering new technology.  Now it turns out
the rule &quot;large and disciplined organizations win&quot; needs to have a
qualification appended: &quot;at games that change slowly.&quot; No one knew
till change reached a sufficient speed.<br><br>Large organizations <i>will</i> start to do worse now, though,
because for the first time in history they&apos;re no longer getting the
best people.  An ambitious kid graduating from college now doesn&apos;t
want to work for a big company.  They want to work for the hot
startup that&apos;s rapidly growing into one.  If they&apos;re really ambitious,
they want to start it. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>This doesn&apos;t mean big companies will disappear.  To say that
startups will succeed implies that big companies will exist, because
startups that succeed either become big companies or are acquired
by them. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
But large organizations will probably never again
play the leading role they did up till the last quarter of the
twentieth century.<br><br>It&apos;s kind of surprising that a trend that lasted so long would ever
run out.  How often does it happen that a rule works for thousands
of years, then switches polarity?<br><br>The millennia-long run of bigger-is-better left us with a lot of
<a href="credentials.html">traditions</a> that are now obsolete, 
but extremely deeply rooted.
Which means the ambitious can now do arbitrage on them.  It will
be very valuable to understand precisely which ideas to keep and
which can now be discarded.<br><br>The place to look is where the spread of smallness began: in the
world of startups.<br><br>There have always been occasional cases, particularly in the US,
of ambitious people who grew the ladder under them instead of
climbing it.  But till recently this was an anomalous route that
tended to be followed only by outsiders.  It was no coincidence
that the great industrialists of the nineteenth century had so
little formal education.  As huge as their companies eventually
became, they were all essentially mechanics and shopkeepers at
first.  That was a social step no one with a college education would
take if they could avoid it.  Till the rise of technology startups,
and in particular, Internet startups, it was very unusual for
educated people to start their own businesses.<br><br>The eight men who left Shockley Semiconductor to found Fairchild
Semiconductor, the original Silicon Valley startup, weren&apos;t even
trying to start a company at first.  They were just looking for a
company willing to hire them as a group.  Then one of their parents
introduced them to a small investment bank that offered to find
funding for them to start their own, so they did.  But starting a
company was an alien idea to them; it was something they backed
into.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Now I would guess that practically every Stanford or Berkeley
undergrad who knows how to program has at least considered the idea
of starting a startup.  East Coast universities are not far behind,
and British universities only a little behind them.  This pattern
suggests that attitudes at Stanford and Berkeley are not an anomaly,
but a leading indicator.  This is the way the world is going.<br><br>Of course, Internet startups are still only a fraction of the world&apos;s
economy.  Could a trend based on them be that powerful?<br><br>I think so.  There&apos;s no reason to suppose there&apos;s any limit to the
amount of work that could be done in this area.  Like science,
wealth seems to expand fractally.  Steam power was a sliver of the
British economy when Watt started working on it.  But his work led
to more work till that sliver had expanded into something bigger
than the whole economy of which it had initially been a part.<br><br>The same thing could happen with the Internet.  If Internet startups
offer the best opportunity for ambitious people, then a lot of
ambitious people will start them, and this bit of the economy will
balloon in the usual fractal way.<br><br>Even if Internet-related applications only become a tenth of the
world&apos;s economy, this component will set the tone for the rest.
The most dynamic part of the economy always does, in everything
from salaries to standards of dress.  Not just because of its
prestige, but because the principles underlying the most dynamic
part of the economy tend to be ones that work.<br><br>For the future, the trend to bet on seems to be networks of small,
autonomous groups whose performance is measured individually.  And
the societies that win will be the ones with the least impedance.<br><br>As with the original industrial revolution, some societies are going
to be better at this than others.  Within a generation of its birth
in England, the Industrial Revolution had spread to continental
Europe and North America.  But it didn&apos;t spread everywhere.  This
new way of doing things could only take root in places that were
prepared for it.  It could only spread to places that already had
a vigorous middle class.<br><br>There is a similar social component to the transformation that began
in Silicon Valley in the 1960s.  Two new kinds of techniques were
developed there: techniques for building integrated circuits, and
techniques for building a new type of company designed to grow fast
by creating new technology.  The techniques for building integrated
circuits spread rapidly to other countries.  But the techniques for
building startups didn&apos;t.  Fifty years later, startups are ubiquitous
in Silicon Valley and common in a handful of other US cities, but
they&apos;re still an anomaly in most of the world.<br><br>Part of the reason&#x2014;possibly the main reason&#x2014;that startups
have not spread as broadly as the Industrial Revolution did is their
social disruptiveness.  Though it brought many social changes, the
Industrial Revolution was not fighting the principle that bigger
is better.  Quite the opposite: the two dovetailed beautifully.
The new industrial companies adapted the customs of existing large
organizations like the military and the civil service, and the
resulting hybrid worked well.  &quot;Captains of industry&quot; issued orders
to &quot;armies of workers,&quot; and everyone knew what they were supposed
to do.<br><br>Startups seem to go more against the grain, socially.  It&apos;s hard
for them to flourish in societies that value hierarchy and stability,
just as it was hard for industrialization to flourish in societies
ruled by people who stole at will from the merchant class.  But
there were already a handful of countries past that stage when the
Industrial Revolution happened.   There do not seem to be that many
ready this time.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

a report about entrepreneurship.  Unfortunately after reading it
they decided  it was too controversial to include.)</i><br><br>
VC funding will probably dry up somewhat during the present recession,
like it usually does in bad times.  But this time the result may
be different.  This time the number of new startups may not decrease.
And that could be dangerous for VCs.<br><br>When VC funding dried up after the Internet Bubble, startups dried
up too.   There were not a lot of new startups being founded in
2003.  But startups aren&apos;t tied to VC the way they were 10 years
ago.  It&apos;s now possible for VCs and startups to diverge.  And if
they do, they may not reconverge once the economy gets better.<br><br>The reason startups no longer depend so much on VCs is one that
everyone in the startup business knows by now: it has gotten much
cheaper to start a startup.  There are four main reasons: Moore&apos;s
law has made hardware cheap; open source has made software free;
the web has made marketing and distribution free; and more powerful
programming languages mean development teams can be smaller.  These
changes have pushed the cost of starting a startup down into the
noise.  In a lot of startups&#x2014;probaby most startups funded by
Y Combinator&#x2014;the biggest expense is simply the founders&apos;
living expenses.  We&apos;ve had startups that were profitable on revenues
of $3000 a month.<br><br>$3000 is insignificant as revenues go.  Why should anyone care about
a startup making $3000 a month?  Because, although insignificant
as <i>revenue</i>, this amount of money can change a startup&apos;s
<i>funding</i> situation completely.<br><br>Someone running a startup is always calculating in the back of their
mind how much &quot;runway&quot; they have&#x2014;how long they have till the
money in the bank runs out and they either have to be profitable,
raise more money, or go out of business.  Once you cross the threshold
of profitability, however low, your runway becomes infinite.  It&apos;s
a qualitative change, like the stars turning into lines and
disappearing when the Enterprise accelerates to warp speed.  Once
you&apos;re profitable you don&apos;t need investors&apos; money.  And because
Internet startups have become so cheap to run, the threshold of
profitability can be trivially low.  Which means many Internet
startups don&apos;t need VC-scale investments anymore.  For many startups,
VC funding has, in the language of VCs, gone from a must-have to a
nice-to-have.<br><br>This change happened while no one was looking, and its effects have
been largely masked so far.  It was during the trough after the
Internet Bubble that it became trivially cheap to start a startup,
but few realized it because startups were so out of fashion.   When
startups came back into fashion, around 2005, investors were starting
to write checks again.  And while founders may not have needed VC
money the way they used to, they were willing to take it if
offered&#x2014;partly because there was a tradition of startups
taking VC money, and partly because startups, like dogs, tend to
eat when given the opportunity.  As long as VCs were writing checks,
founders were never forced to explore the limits of how little they
needed them.  There were a few startups who hit these limits
accidentally because of their unusual circumstances&#x2014;most
famously 37signals, which hit the limit because they crossed into
startup land from the other direction: they started as a consulting
firm, so they had revenue before they had a product.<br><br>VCs and founders are like two components that used to be bolted
together.  Around 2000 the bolt was removed.  Because the components
have so far been subjected to the same forces, they still seem to
be joined together, but really one is just resting on the other.
A sharp impact would make them fly apart.  And the present recession
could be that impact.<br><br>Because of Y Combinator&apos;s position at the extreme end of the spectrum,
we&apos;d be the first to see signs of a separation between founders and
investors, and we are in fact seeing it.  For example, though the
stock market crash does seem to have made investors more cautious,
it doesn&apos;t seem to have had any effect on the number of people who
want to start startups.  We take applications for funding every 6
months.  Applications for the current funding cycle closed on October
17, well after the markets tanked, and even so we got a record
number, up 40% from the same cycle a year before.<br><br>Maybe things will be different a year from now, if the economy
continues to get worse, but so far there is zero slackening of
interest among potential founders.  That&apos;s different from the way
things felt in 2001.  Then there was a widespread feeling among
potential founders that startups were over, and that one should
just go to grad school.   That isn&apos;t happening this time, and part
of the reason is that even in a bad economy it&apos;s not that hard to
build something that makes $3000 a month.  If investors stop writing
checks, who cares?<br><br>We also see signs of a divergence between founders and investors
in the attitudes of existing startups we&apos;ve funded.  I was talking
to one recently that had a round fall through at the last minute
over the sort of trifle that breaks deals when investors feel they
have the upper hand&#x2014;over an uncertainty about whether the
founders had correctly filed their 83(b) forms, if you can believe
that.  And yet this startup is obviously going to succeed: their
traffic and revenue graphs look like a jet taking off.  So I asked
them if they wanted me to introduce them to more investors.  To my
surprise, they said no&#x2014;that they&apos;d just spent four months
dealing with investors, and they were actually a lot happier now
that they didn&apos;t have to.  There was a friend they wanted to hire
with the investor money, and now they&apos;d have to postpone that.  But
otherwise they felt they had enough in the bank to make it to
profitability.  To make sure, they were moving to a cheaper apartment.
And in this economy I bet they got a good deal on it.<br><br>I&apos;ve detected this &quot;investors aren&apos;t worth the trouble&quot; vibe from
several YC founders I&apos;ve talked to recently.  At least one startup
from the most recent (summer) cycle may not even raise angel money,
let alone VC.  <a href="http://ticketstumbler.com">Ticketstumbler</a>
made it to profitability on Y Combinator&apos;s $15,000 investment and
they hope not to need more.  This surprised even us.  Although YC
is based on the idea of it being cheap to start a startup, we never
anticipated that founders would grow successful startups on nothing
more than YC funding.<br><br>If founders decide VCs aren&apos;t worth the trouble, that could be bad
for VCs.  When the economy bounces back in a few years and they&apos;re
ready to write checks again, they may find that founders have moved
on.<br><br>There is a founder community just as there&apos;s a VC community.  They
all know one another, and techniques spread rapidly between them.
If one tries a new programming language or a new hosting provider
and gets good results, 6 months later half of them are using it.
And the same is true for funding.  The current generation of founders
want to raise money from VCs, and Sequoia specifically, because
Larry and Sergey took money from VCs, and Sequoia specifically.
Imagine what it would do to the VC business if the next hot company
didn&apos;t take VC at all.<br><br>VCs think they&apos;re playing a zero sum game.  In fact, it&apos;s not even
that.  If you lose a deal to Benchmark, you lose that deal, but VC
as an industry still wins.  If you lose a deal to None, all VCs
lose.<br><br>This recession may be different from the one after the Internet
Bubble.  This time founders may keep starting startups.  And if
they do, VCs will have to keep writing checks, or they could become
irrelevant.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, David Hornik, Jessica

Korean cram schools that said <blockquote>
  Admission to the right university can make or break an ambitious
  young South Korean.
</blockquote> A parent added: <blockquote>
  &quot;In our country, college entrance exams determine 70 to 80 percent
  of a person&apos;s future.&quot;
</blockquote> It was striking how old fashioned this sounded.  And
yet when I was in high school it wouldn&apos;t have seemed too far off
as a description of the US.  Which means things must have been
changing here.<br><br>The course of people&apos;s lives in the US now seems to be determined
less by credentials and more by performance than it was 25 years
ago.  Where you go to college still matters, but not like it used
to.<br><br>What happened?<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Judging people by their academic credentials was in its time an
advance.  The practice seems to have begun in China, where starting
in 587 candidates for the imperial civil service had to take an
exam on classical literature.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font> It was also a test of wealth,
because the knowledge it tested was so specialized that passing
required years of expensive training.  But though wealth was a
necessary condition for passing, it was not a sufficient one.  By
the standards of the rest of the world in 587, the Chinese system
was very enlightened.  Europeans didn&apos;t introduce formal civil
service exams till the nineteenth century, and even then they seem
to have been influenced by the Chinese example.<br><br>Before credentials, government positions were obtained mainly by
family influence, if not outright bribery.   It was a great step
forward to judge people by their performance on a test.  But by no
means a perfect solution.  When you judge people that way, you tend
to get cram schools&#x2014;which they did in Ming China and nineteenth
century England just as much as in present day South Korea.<br><br>What cram schools are, in effect, is leaks in a seal.  The use of
credentials
was an attempt to seal off the direct transmission of power between
generations, and cram schools represent that power finding holes
in the seal.  Cram schools turn wealth in one generation into
credentials in the next.<br><br>It&apos;s hard to beat this phenomenon, because the schools adjust to suit
whatever the tests measure.  When the tests are narrow and
predictable, you get cram schools on the classic model, like those
that prepared candidates for Sandhurst (the British West Point) or
the classes American students take now to improve their SAT scores.
But as the tests get broader, the schools do too.  Preparing a
candidate for the Chinese imperial civil service exams took years,
as prep school does today.  But the raison d&apos;etre of all these
institutions has been the same: to beat the system.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>History suggests that, all other things being equal, a society
prospers in proportion to its ability to prevent parents from
influencing their children&apos;s success directly.  It&apos;s a fine thing
for parents to help their children indirectly&#x2014;for example,
by helping them to become smarter or more disciplined, which then
makes them more successful.  The problem comes when parents use
direct methods: when they are able to use their own wealth or power
as a substitute for their children&apos;s qualities.<br><br>Parents will tend to do this when they can.  Parents will die for
their kids, so it&apos;s not surprising to find they&apos;ll also push their
scruples to the limits for them.  Especially if other parents are
doing it.<br><br>Sealing off this force has a double advantage.  Not only does a
society get &quot;the best man for the job,&quot; but
parents&apos; ambitions are diverted from direct methods to indirect
ones&#x2014;to actually trying to raise their kids well.<br><br>But we should expect it to be very hard to contain parents&apos; efforts
to obtain an unfair advantage for their kids.  We&apos;re dealing with
one of the most powerful forces in human nature.  We shouldn&apos;t expect
naive solutions to work, any more than we&apos;d expect naive solutions
for keeping heroin out of a prison to work.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>The obvious way to solve the problem is to make credentials better.
If the tests a society uses are currently hackable, we can study
the way people beat them and try to plug the holes.  You can use
the cram schools to show you where most of the holes are.  They
also tell you when you&apos;re succeeding in fixing them: when cram
schools become less popular.<br><br>A more general solution
would be to push for increased transparency, especially at critical
social bottlenecks like college admissions.  In the US this process
still shows many outward signs of corruption.  For example, legacy
admissions.  The official story is that legacy status doesn&apos;t carry
much weight, because all it does is break ties: applicants are
bucketed by ability, and legacy status is only used to decide between
the applicants in the bucket that straddles the cutoff.  But what
this means is that a university can make legacy status have as much
or as little weight as they want, by adjusting the size of the
bucket that straddles the cutoff.<br><br>By gradually chipping away at the abuse of credentials, you could
probably make them more airtight.  But what a long fight it would
be.  Especially when the institutions administering the tests don&apos;t
really want them to be airtight.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Fortunately there&apos;s a better way to prevent the direct transmission
of power between generations.  Instead of trying to make credentials
harder to hack, we can also make them matter less.<br><br>Let&apos;s think about what credentials are for.  What they are,
functionally, is a way of predicting performance.  If you could
measure actual performance, you wouldn&apos;t need them.<br><br>So why did they even evolve?  Why haven&apos;t we just been measuring
actual performance?  Think about where credentialism first appeared:
in selecting candidates for large organizations.  Individual
performance is hard to measure in large organizations, and the
harder performance is to measure, the more important it is
to predict it.  If an organization could immediately and cheaply
measure the performance of recruits, they wouldn&apos;t need to examine
their credentials.  They could take everyone and keep just the good
ones.<br><br>Large organizations can&apos;t do this.  But a bunch of small organizations
in a market can come close.  A market takes every organization and
keeps just the good ones.  As organizations get smaller, this
approaches taking every person and keeping just the good ones.  So
all other things being equal, a society consisting of more, smaller
organizations will care less about credentials.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>That&apos;s what&apos;s been happening in the US.  That&apos;s why those quotes
from Korea sound so old fashioned.  They&apos;re talking about an economy
like America&apos;s a few decades ago, dominated by a few big companies.
The route for the ambitious in that sort of environment is to join
one and climb to the top.  Credentials matter a lot then.  In the 
culture of a large organization, an elite pedigree becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy.<br><br>This doesn&apos;t work in small companies.  Even if your colleagues were
impressed by your credentials, they&apos;d soon be parted from you if
your performance didn&apos;t match, because the company would go out of
business and the people would be dispersed.<br><br>In a world of small companies, performance is all anyone cares
about.  People hiring for a startup don&apos;t care whether you&apos;ve even
graduated from college, let alone which one.  All they care about
is what you can do.  Which is in fact all that should matter, even
in a large organization.  The reason credentials have such prestige
is that for so long the large organizations
in a society tended to be the most powerful.  But in the US at least
they don&apos;t have the monopoly on power they once did, precisely
because they can&apos;t measure (and thus reward) individual performance.
Why spend twenty years climbing the corporate ladder when you can
get rewarded directly by the market?<br><br>I realize I see a more exaggerated version of the change than most
other people.  As a partner at an early stage venture funding firm,
I&apos;m like a jumpmaster shoving people out of the old world of
credentials and into the new one of performance.  I&apos;m an agent of
the change I&apos;m seeing.  But I don&apos;t think I&apos;m imagining it.  It was
not so easy 25 years ago for an ambitious person to choose to be
judged directly by the market.  You had to go through bosses, and
they were influenced by where you&apos;d been to college.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>What made it possible for small organizations to succeed in America?
I&apos;m still not entirely sure.  Startups are certainly a large part
of it.  Small organizations can develop new ideas faster than large
ones, and new ideas are increasingly valuable.<br><br>But I don&apos;t think startups account for all the shift from credentials
to measurement.  My friend Julian Weber told me that when he went
to work for a New York law firm in the 1950s they paid associates
far less than firms do today.  Law firms then made no pretense of
paying people according to the value of the work they&apos;d done.  Pay
was based on seniority.  The younger employees were paying their
dues.  They&apos;d be rewarded later.<br><br>The same principle prevailed at industrial companies.  When my
father was working at Westinghouse in the 1970s, he had people
working for him who made more than he did, because they&apos;d been there
longer.<br><br>Now companies increasingly have to pay employees market price for
the work they do.   One reason is that employees no longer trust
companies to deliver 
<a href="ladder.html">deferred rewards</a>: why work to accumulate
deferred rewards at a company that might go bankrupt, or be taken
over and have all its implicit obligations wiped out?  The other
is that some companies broke ranks and started to pay young employees
large amounts.  This was particularly true in consulting, law, and
finance, where it led to the phenomenon of yuppies.  The word is
rarely used today because it&apos;s no longer surprising to see a 25
year old with money, but in 1985 the sight of a 25 year old
<i>professional</i> able to afford a new BMW was so novel that it
called forth a new word.<br><br>The classic yuppie worked for a small organization.  He didn&apos;t work
for General Widget, but for the law firm that handled General
Widget&apos;s acquisitions or the investment bank that floated their
bond issues.<br><br>Startups and yuppies entered the American conceptual vocabulary
roughly simultaneously in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  I don&apos;t
think there was a causal connection.  Startups happened because
technology started to change so fast that big companies could no
longer keep a lid on the smaller ones.  I don&apos;t think the rise of
yuppies was inspired by it; it seems more as if there was a change
in the social conventions (and perhaps the laws) governing the way
big companies worked.  But the two phenomena rapidly fused to produce
a principle that now seems obvious: paying energetic young people
market rates, and getting correspondingly high performance from
them.<br><br>At about the same time the US economy rocketed out of the doldrums
that had afflicted it for most of the 1970s.  Was there a connection?
I don&apos;t know enough to say, but it felt like it at the time.  There
was a lot of energy released.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Countries worried about their competitiveness are right to be
concerned about the number of startups started within them.  But
they would do even better to examine the underlying principle.  Do
they let energetic young people get paid market rate for the work
they do?  The young are the test, because when people aren&apos;t rewarded
according to performance, they&apos;re invariably rewarded according to
seniority instead.<br><br>All it takes is a few beachheads in your economy that pay for
performance.  Measurement spreads like heat.  If one part of a
society is better at measurement than others, it tends to push the
others to do better.  If people who are young but smart and driven
can make more by starting their own companies than by working for
existing ones, the existing companies are forced to pay more to
keep them.  So market rates gradually permeate every organization,
even the government.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The measurement of performance will tend to push even the organizations
issuing credentials into line.  When we were kids I used to annoy
my sister by ordering her to do things I knew she was about to do
anyway.  As credentials are superseded by performance, a similar
role is the best former gatekeepers can hope for.  Once credential
granting institutions are no longer in the self-fullfilling prophecy
business, they&apos;ll have to work harder to predict the future.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Credentials are a step beyond bribery and influence.  But they&apos;re
not the final step.  There&apos;s an even better way to block the
transmission of power between generations: to encourage the trend
toward an economy made of more, smaller units.  Then you can measure
what credentials merely predict.<br><br>No one likes the transmission of power between generations&#x2014;not
the left or the right.  But the market forces favored by the right
turn out to be a better way of preventing it than the credentials
the left are forced to fall back on.<br><br>The era of credentials began to end when the power of large
organizations <a href="highres.html">peaked</a> 
in the late twentieth century.  Now we seem
to be entering a new era based on measurement.  The reason the new
model has advanced so rapidly is that it works so much better.  It
shows no sign of slowing.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] Miyazaki, Ichisada

this similarity?  One possible explanation is that they deal with
questions that have no definite answers, so there&apos;s no back pressure
on people&apos;s opinions.  Since no one can be proven wrong, every
opinion is equally valid, and sensing this, everyone lets fly with
theirs.<br><br>But this isn&apos;t true.  There are certainly some political questions
that have definite answers, like how much a new government policy
will cost.  But the more precise political questions suffer the
same fate as the vaguer ones.<br><br>I think what religion and politics have in common is that they
become part of people&apos;s identity, and people can never have a
fruitful argument about something that&apos;s part of their identity.
By definition they&apos;re partisan.<br><br>Which topics engage people&apos;s identity depends on the people, not
the topic.  For example, a discussion about a battle that included
citizens of one or more of the countries involved would probably
degenerate into a political argument.  But a discussion today about
a battle that took place in the Bronze Age probably wouldn&apos;t.  No
one would know what side to be on.  So it&apos;s not politics that&apos;s the
source of the trouble, but identity.  When people say a discussion
has degenerated into a religious war, what they really mean is that
it has started to be driven mostly by people&apos;s identities.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Because the point at which this happens depends on the people rather
than the topic, it&apos;s a mistake to conclude that because a question
tends to provoke religious wars, it must have no answer. For example,
the question of the relative merits of programming languages often
degenerates into a religious war, because so many programmers
identify as X programmers or Y programmers.  This sometimes leads
people to conclude the question must be unanswerable&#x2014;that all
languages are equally good.  Obviously that&apos;s false: anything else
people make can be well or badly designed; why should this be
uniquely impossible for programming languages?  And indeed, you can
have a fruitful discussion about the relative merits of programming
languages, so long as you exclude people who respond from identity.<br><br>More generally, you can have a fruitful discussion about a topic
only if it doesn&apos;t engage the identities of any of the
participants.  What makes politics and religion such minefields is
that they engage so many people&apos;s identities.  But you could in
principle have a useful conversation about them with some people.
And there are other topics that might seem harmless, like the
relative merits of Ford and Chevy pickup trucks, that you couldn&apos;t
safely talk about with <a href="http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060418/NEWS/604180378/1039">others</a>.<br><br>The most intriguing thing about this theory, if it&apos;s right, is that
it explains not merely which kinds of discussions to avoid, but how
to have better ideas.  If people can&apos;t think clearly about anything
that has become part of their identity, then all other things being
equal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as
possible. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Most people reading this will already be fairly tolerant.  But there
is a step beyond thinking of yourself as x but tolerating y: not
even to consider yourself an x.  The more labels you have for
yourself, the dumber they make you.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
When that happens, it tends to happen fast, like a core going
critical.  The threshold for participating goes down to zero, which
brings in more people.  And they tend to say incendiary things,
which draw more and angrier counterarguments.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There may be some things it&apos;s a net win to include in your
identity.  For example, being a scientist.  But arguably that is
more of a placeholder than an actual label&#x2014;like putting NMI on a
form that asks for your middle initial&#x2014;because it doesn&apos;t commit
you to believing anything in particular.   A scientist isn&apos;t committed
to believing in natural selection in the same way a bibilical
literalist is committed to rejecting it.  All he&apos;s committed to is
following the evidence wherever it leads.<br><br>Considering yourself a scientist is equivalent to putting a sign
in a cupboard saying &quot;this cupboard must be kept empty.&quot;  Yes,
strictly speaking, you&apos;re putting something in the cupboard, but
not in the ordinary sense.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, and Robert

February 2009<br><br>One of the things I always tell startups is a principle I learned
from Paul Buchheit: it&apos;s better to make a few people really happy
than to make a lot of people semi-happy.  I was saying recently to
a reporter that if I could only tell startups 10 things, this would
be one of them.  Then I thought: what would the other 9 be?<br><br>When I made the list there turned out to be 13:
</p><p style="margin-top:32px">
<b>1. Pick good cofounders.</b><br><br>Cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate.  You
can change anything about a house except where it is.  In a startup
you can change your idea easily, but changing your cofounders is
hard. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
And the success of a startup is almost always a function
of its founders.<br><br><b>2. Launch fast.</b><br><br>The reason to launch fast is not so much that it&apos;s critical to get
your product to market early, but that you haven&apos;t really started
working on it till you&apos;ve launched.  Launching teaches you what you
should have been building.  Till you know that you&apos;re wasting your
time.  So the main value of whatever you launch with is as a pretext
for engaging users.<br><br><b>3. Let your idea evolve.</b><br><br>This is the second half of launching fast. Launch fast and iterate.
It&apos;s a big mistake to treat a startup as if it were merely a matter
of implementing some brilliant initial idea. As in an essay, most
of the ideas appear in the implementing.<br><br><b>4. Understand your users.</b><br><br>You can envision the wealth created by a startup as a rectangle,
where one side is the number of users and the other is how much you
improve their lives.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
The second dimension is the one you have
most control over.  And indeed, the growth in the first will be
driven by how well you do in the second.  As in science, the hard
part is not answering questions but asking them: the hard part is
seeing something new that users lack. The better you understand
them the better the odds of doing that. That&apos;s why so many successful
startups make something the founders needed.<br><br><b>5. Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent.</b><br><br>Ideally you want to make large numbers of users love you, but you
can&apos;t expect to hit that right away.  Initially you have to choose
between satisfying all the needs of a subset of potential users,
or satisfying a subset of the needs of all potential users.  Take
the first. It&apos;s easier to expand userwise than satisfactionwise.
And perhaps more importantly, it&apos;s harder to lie to yourself.  If
you think you&apos;re 85% of the way to a great product, how do you know
it&apos;s not 70%?  Or 10%?  Whereas it&apos;s easy to know how many users
you have.<br><br><b>6. Offer surprisingly good customer service.</b><br><br>Customers are used to being maltreated.  Most of the companies they
deal with are quasi-monopolies that get away with atrocious customer
service. Your own ideas about what&apos;s possible have been unconsciously
lowered by such experiences.  Try making your customer service not
merely good, but 
<a href="http://www.diaryofawebsite.com/blog/2008/07/wufoo-and-the-art-of-customer-service/">surprisingly good</a>.  Go out of your way to make
people happy.  They&apos;ll be overwhelmed; you&apos;ll see.  In the earliest
stages of a startup, it pays to offer customer service on a level
that wouldn&apos;t scale, because it&apos;s a way of learning about your
users.<br><br><b>7. You make what you measure.</b><br><br>I learned this one from Joe Kraus. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Merely measuring something
has an uncanny tendency to improve it.  If you want to make your
user numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and every
day plot the number of users.  You&apos;ll be delighted when it goes up
and disappointed when it goes down.  Pretty soon you&apos;ll start
noticing what makes the number go up, and you&apos;ll start to do more
of that.  Corollary: be careful what you measure.<br><br><b>8. Spend little.</b><br><br>I can&apos;t emphasize enough how important it is for a startup to be cheap.
Most startups fail before they make something people want, and the
most common form of failure is running out of money.  So being cheap
is (almost) interchangeable with iterating rapidly.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
But it&apos;s
more than that.  A culture of cheapness keeps companies young in
something like the way exercise keeps people young.<br><br><b>9. Get ramen profitable.</b><br><br>&quot;Ramen profitable&quot; means a startup makes just enough to pay the
founders&apos; living expenses.  It&apos;s not rapid prototyping for business
models (though it can be), but more a way of hacking the investment
process.  Once you cross over into ramen profitable, it completely
changes your relationship with investors.  It&apos;s also great for
morale.<br><br><b>10. Avoid distractions.</b><br><br>Nothing kills startups like distractions.  The worst type are those
that pay money: day jobs, consulting, profitable side-projects.
The startup may have more long-term potential, but you&apos;ll always
interrupt working on it to answer calls from people paying you now.
Paradoxically, <a href="fundraising.html">fundraising</a> is this type of distraction, so try to
minimize that too.<br><br><b>11. Don&apos;t get demoralized.</b><br><br>Though the immediate cause of death in a startup tends to be running
out of money, the underlying cause is usually lack of focus.  Either
the company is run by stupid people (which can&apos;t be fixed with
advice) or the people are smart but got demoralized.  Starting a
startup is a huge moral weight.  Understand this and make a conscious
effort not to be ground down by it, just as you&apos;d be careful to
bend at the knees when picking up a heavy box.<br><br><b>12. Don&apos;t give up.</b><br><br>Even if you get demoralized, <a href="die.html">don&apos;t give up</a>.  You can get surprisingly
far by just not giving up.  This isn&apos;t true in all fields.  There
are a lot of people who couldn&apos;t become good mathematicians no
matter how long they persisted.  But startups aren&apos;t like that.
Sheer effort is usually enough, so long as you keep morphing your
idea.<br><br><b>13. Deals fall through.</b><br><br>One of the most useful skills we learned from Viaweb was not getting
our hopes up.  We probably had 20 deals of various types fall
through.  After the first 10 or so we learned to treat deals as
background processes that we should ignore till they terminated.
It&apos;s very dangerous to morale to start to depend on deals closing,
not just because they so often don&apos;t, but because it makes them
less likely to.
</p><p style="margin-top:32px">
Having gotten it down to 13 sentences, I asked myself which I&apos;d
choose if I could only keep one.<br><br>Understand your users.  That&apos;s the key.  The essential task in a
startup is to create wealth; the dimension of wealth you have most
control over is how much you improve users&apos; lives; and the hardest
part of that is knowing what to make for them.  Once you know what
to make, it&apos;s mere effort to make it, and most decent hackers are
capable of that.<br><br>Understanding your users is part of half the principles in this
list.  That&apos;s the reason to launch early, to understand your users.
Evolving your idea is the embodiment of understanding your users.
Understanding your users well will tend to push you toward making
something that makes a few people deeply happy.  The most important
reason for having surprisingly good customer service is that it
helps you understand your users.  And understanding your users will
even ensure your morale, because when everything else is collapsing
around you, having just ten users who love you will keep you going.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]

old last week.  Initially it was supposed to be a side project&#x2014;an
application to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and future
Y Combinator founders to exchange news.  It&apos;s grown bigger and taken
up more time than I expected, but I don&apos;t regret that because I&apos;ve
learned so much from working on it.<br><br><b>Growth</b><br><br>When we launched in February 2007, weekday traffic was around 1600
daily uniques.  It&apos;s since <a href="http://ycombinator.com/images/2yeartraffic.png">grown</a> to around 22,000.  This growth
rate is a bit higher than I&apos;d like.  I&apos;d like the site to grow,
since a site that isn&apos;t growing at least slowly is probably dead.
But I wouldn&apos;t want it to grow as large as Digg or Reddit&#x2014;mainly
because that would dilute the character of the site, but also because
I don&apos;t want to spend all my time dealing with scaling.<br><br>I already have problems enough with that.  Remember, the original
motivation for HN was to test a new programming language, and
moreover one that&apos;s focused on experimenting with language design,
not performance.  Every time the site gets slow, I fortify myself
by recalling McIlroy and Bentley&apos;s famous quote
<blockquote>
  The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special
  cases.
</blockquote>
and look for the bottleneck I can remove with least code.  So far
I&apos;ve been able to keep up, in the sense that performance has remained
consistently mediocre despite 14x growth. I don&apos;t know what I&apos;ll
do next, but I&apos;ll probably think of something.<br><br>This is my attitude to the site generally.  Hacker News is an
experiment, and an experiment in a very young field.  Sites of this
type are only a few years old.  Internet conversation generally is
only a few decades old.  So we&apos;ve probably only discovered a fraction
of what we eventually will.<br><br>That&apos;s why I&apos;m so optimistic about HN.  When a technology is this
young, the existing solutions are usually terrible; which means it
must be possible to do much better; which means many problems that
seem insoluble aren&apos;t. Including, I hope, the problem that has
afflicted so many previous communities: being ruined by growth.<br><br><b>Dilution</b><br><br>Users have worried about that since the site was a few months old.
So far these alarms have been false, but they may not always be.
Dilution is a hard problem. But probably soluble; it doesn&apos;t mean
much that open conversations have &quot;always&quot; been destroyed by growth
when &quot;always&quot; equals 20 instances.<br><br>But it&apos;s important to remember we&apos;re trying to solve a new problem,
because that means we&apos;re going to have to try new things, most of
which probably won&apos;t work.  A couple weeks ago I tried displaying
the names of users with the highest average comment scores in orange.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
That was a mistake.  Suddenly a culture that had been more
or less united was divided into haves and have-nots.  I didn&apos;t
realize how united the culture had been till I saw it divided.  It
was painful to watch.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>So orange usernames won&apos;t be back.  (Sorry about that.)  But there
will be other equally broken-seeming ideas in the future, and the
ones that turn out to work will probably seem just as broken as
those that don&apos;t.<br><br>Probably the most important thing I&apos;ve learned about dilution is
that it&apos;s measured more in behavior than users. It&apos;s bad behavior
you want to keep out more than bad people. User behavior turns out
to be surprisingly malleable.  If people are 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html">expected</a> to behave
well, they tend to; and vice versa.<br><br>Though of course forbidding bad behavior does tend to keep away bad
people, because they feel uncomfortably constrained in a place where
they have to behave well.  But this way of keeping them out is
gentler and probably also more effective than overt barriers.<br><br>It&apos;s pretty clear now that the broken windows theory applies to
community sites as well.  The theory is that minor forms of bad
behavior encourage worse ones: that a neighborhood with lots of
graffiti and broken windows becomes one where robberies occur.  I
was living in New York when Giuliani introduced the reforms that
made the broken windows theory famous, and the transformation was
miraculous. And I was a Reddit user when the opposite happened
there, and the transformation was equally dramatic.<br><br>I&apos;m not criticizing Steve and Alexis.  What happened to Reddit
didn&apos;t happen out of neglect.  From the start they had a policy of
censoring nothing except spam.  Plus Reddit had different goals
from Hacker News.  Reddit was a startup, not a side project; its
goal was to grow as fast as possible.  Combine rapid growth and
zero censorship, and the result is a free for all.  But I don&apos;t
think they&apos;d do much differently if they were doing it again.
Measured by traffic, Reddit is much more successful than Hacker
News.<br><br>But what happened to Reddit won&apos;t inevitably happen to HN. There
are several local maxima.  There can be places that are free for
alls and places that are more thoughtful, just as there are in the
real world; and people will behave differently depending on which
they&apos;re in, just as they do in the real world.<br><br>I&apos;ve observed this in the wild.  I&apos;ve seen people cross-posting on
Reddit and Hacker News who actually took the trouble to write two
versions, a flame for Reddit and a more subdued version for HN.<br><br><b>Submissions</b><br><br>There are two major types of problems a site like Hacker News needs
to avoid: bad stories and bad comments.  So far the danger of bad
stories seems smaller.  The stories on the frontpage now are still
roughly the ones that would have been there when HN started.<br><br>I once thought I&apos;d have to weight votes to keep crap off the
frontpage, but I haven&apos;t had to yet.  I wouldn&apos;t have predicted the
frontpage would hold up so well, and I&apos;m not sure why it has.
Perhaps only the more thoughtful users care enough to submit and
upvote links, so the marginal cost of one random new user approaches
zero.  Or perhaps the frontpage protects itself, by advertising what type of submission is expected.<br><br>The most dangerous thing for the frontpage is stuff that&apos;s too easy
to upvote.  If someone proves a new theorem, it takes some work by
the reader to decide whether or not to upvote it.  An amusing cartoon
takes less.  A rant with a rallying cry as the title takes zero,
because people vote it up without even reading it.<br><br>Hence what I call the Fluff Principle: on a user-voted news site,
the links that are easiest to judge will take over unless you take
specific measures to prevent it.<br><br>Hacker News has two kinds of protections against fluff.  The most
common types of fluff links are banned as off-topic.  Pictures of
kittens, political diatribes, and so on are explicitly banned.  This
keeps out most fluff, but not all of it.  Some links are both fluff,
in the sense of being very short, and also on topic.<br><br>There&apos;s no single solution to that.  If a link is just an empty
rant, editors will sometimes kill it even if it&apos;s on topic in the
sense of being about hacking, because it&apos;s not on topic by the real
standard, which is to engage one&apos;s intellectual curiosity.  If the
posts on a site are characteristically of this type I sometimes ban
it, which means new stuff at that url is auto-killed.  If a post
has a linkbait title, editors sometimes rephrase it to be more
matter-of-fact.  This is especially necessary with links whose
titles are rallying cries, because otherwise they become implicit
&quot;vote up if you believe such-and-such&quot; posts, which are the most
extreme form of fluff.<br><br>The techniques for dealing with links have to evolve, because the
links do. The existence of aggregators has already affected what
they aggregate. Writers now deliberately write things to draw traffic
from aggregators&#x2014;sometimes even specific ones.  (No, the irony
of this statement is not lost on me.)  Then there are the more
sinister mutations, like linkjacking&#x2014;posting a paraphrase of
someone else&apos;s article and submitting that instead of the original.
These can get a lot of upvotes, because a lot of what&apos;s good in an
article often survives; indeed, the closer the paraphrase is to
plagiarism, the more survives.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>I think it&apos;s important that a site that kills submissions provide
a way for users to see what got killed if they want to.  That keeps
editors honest, and just as importantly, makes users confident
they&apos;d know if the editors stopped being honest. HN users can do
this by flipping a switch called showdead in their profile.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Comments</b><br><br>Bad comments seem to be a harder problem than bad submissions.
While the quality of links on the frontpage of HN hasn&apos;t changed
much, the quality of the median comment may have decreased somewhat.<br><br>There are two main kinds of badness in comments: meanness and
stupidity.  There is a lot of overlap between the two&#x2014;mean
comments are disproportionately likely also to be dumb&#x2014;but
the strategies for dealing with them are different.  Meanness is
easier to control.  You can have rules saying one shouldn&apos;t be mean,
and if you enforce them it seems possible to keep a lid on meanness.<br><br>Keeping a lid on stupidity is harder, perhaps because stupidity is
not so easily distinguishable.  Mean people are more likely to know
they&apos;re being mean than stupid people are to know they&apos;re being
stupid.<br><br>The most dangerous form of stupid comment is not the long but
mistaken argument, but the dumb joke.  Long but mistaken arguments
are actually quite rare.  There is a strong correlation between
comment quality and length; if you wanted to compare the quality
of comments on community sites, average length would be a good
predictor.  Probably the cause is human nature rather than anything
specific to comment threads. Probably it&apos;s simply that stupidity
more often takes the form of having few ideas than wrong ones.<br><br>Whatever the cause, stupid comments tend to be short.  And since
it&apos;s hard to write a short comment that&apos;s distinguished for the
amount of information it conveys, people try to distinguish them
instead by being funny.  The most tempting format for stupid comments
is the supposedly witty put-down, probably because put-downs are
the easiest form of humor. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
So one advantage of forbidding
meanness is that it also cuts down on these.<br><br>Bad comments are like kudzu: they take over rapidly. Comments have
much more effect on new comments than submissions have on new
submissions.  If someone submits a lame article, the other submissions
don&apos;t all become lame.  But if someone posts a stupid comment on a
thread, that sets the tone for the region around it.  People reply
to dumb jokes with dumb jokes.<br><br>Maybe the solution is to add a delay before people can respond to
a comment, and make the length of the delay inversely proportional
to some prediction of its quality.  Then dumb threads would grow
slower.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>People</b><br><br>I notice most of the techniques I&apos;ve described are conservative:
they&apos;re aimed at preserving the character of the site rather than
enhancing it.  I don&apos;t think that&apos;s a bias of mine.  It&apos;s due to
the shape of the problem.  Hacker News had the good fortune to start
out good, so in this case it&apos;s literally a matter of preservation.
But I think this principle would also apply to sites with different
origins.<br><br>The good things in a community site come from people more than
technology; it&apos;s mainly in the prevention of bad things that
technology comes into play. Technology certainly can enhance
discussion.  Nested comments do, for example.  But I&apos;d rather use
a site with primitive features and smart, nice users than a more
advanced one whose users were idiots or <a href="trolls.html">trolls</a>.<br><br>So the most important thing a community site can do is attract the
kind of people it wants.  A site trying to be as big as possible
wants to attract everyone.  But a site aiming at a particular subset
of users has to attract just those&#x2014;and just as importantly,
repel everyone else.  I&apos;ve made a conscious effort to do this on
HN.  The graphic design is as plain as possible, and the site rules
discourage dramatic link titles.  The goal is that the only thing
to interest someone arriving at HN for the first time should be the
ideas expressed there.<br><br>The downside of tuning a site to attract certain people is that,
to those people, it can be too attractive.  I&apos;m all too aware how
addictive Hacker News can be.  For me, as for many users, it&apos;s a
kind of virtual town square.  When I want to take a break from
working, I walk into the square, just as I might into Harvard Square
or University Ave in the physical world.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
But an online square is
more dangerous than a physical one.  If I spent half the day loitering
on University Ave, I&apos;d notice.  I have to walk a mile to get there,
and sitting in a cafe feels different from working. But visiting
an online forum takes just a click, and feels superficially very
much like working.  You may be wasting your time, but you&apos;re not
idle.  Someone is <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">wrong</a> on the Internet, and you&apos;re fixing the
problem.<br><br>Hacker News is definitely useful.  I&apos;ve learned a lot from things
I&apos;ve read on HN.  I&apos;ve written several essays that began as comments
there.  So I wouldn&apos;t want the site to go away.  But I would like
to be sure it&apos;s not a net drag on productivity.  What a disaster
that would be, to attract thousands of smart people to a site that
caused them to waste lots of time.  I wish I could be 100% sure
that&apos;s not a description of HN.<br><br>I feel like the addictiveness of games and social applications is
still a mostly unsolved problem.  The situation now is like it was
with crack in the 1980s: we&apos;ve invented terribly addictive new
things, and we haven&apos;t yet evolved ways to protect ourselves from
them.  We will eventually, and that&apos;s one of the problems I hope
to focus on next.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I tried ranking users by both average and median comment
score, and average (with the high score thrown out) seemed the more
accurate predictor of high quality.  Median may be the more accurate
predictor of low quality though.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Another thing I learned from this experiment is that if you&apos;re
going to distinguish between people, you better be sure you do it
right.  This is one problem where rapid prototyping doesn&apos;t work.<br><br>Indeed, that&apos;s the intellectually honest argument for not discriminating
between various types of people.  The reason not to do it is not
that everyone&apos;s the same, but that it&apos;s bad to do wrong and hard
to do right.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
When I catch egregiously linkjacked posts I replace the url
with that of whatever they copied.  Sites that habitually linkjack
get banned.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Digg is notorious for its lack of transparency.  The root of
the problem is not that the guys running Digg are especially sneaky,
but that they use the wrong algorithm for generating their frontpage.
Instead of bubbling up from the bottom as they get more votes, as
on Reddit, stories start at the top and get pushed down by new
arrivals.<br><br>The reason for the difference is that Digg is derived from Slashdot,
while Reddit is derived from Delicious/popular.  Digg is Slashdot
with voting instead of editors, and Reddit is Delicious/popular
with voting instead of bookmarking.  (You can still see fossils of
their origins in their graphic design.)<br><br>Digg&apos;s algorithm is very vulnerable to gaming, because any story
that makes it onto the frontpage is the new top story.  Which in
turn forces Digg to respond with extreme countermeasures.  A lot
of startups have some kind of secret about the subterfuges they had
to resort to in the early days, and I suspect Digg&apos;s is the extent
to which the top stories were de facto chosen by human editors.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
The dialog on Beavis and Butthead was composed largely of
these, and when I read comments on really bad sites I can hear them
in their voices.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
I suspect most of the techniques for discouraging stupid
comments have yet to be discovered.  Xkcd implemented a particularly
clever one in its IRC channel: don&apos;t allow the same thing twice.
Once someone has said &quot;fail,&quot; no one can ever say it again.  This
would penalize short comments especially, because they have less
room to avoid collisions in.<br><br>Another promising idea is the <a href="http://stupidfilter.org">stupid 
filter</a>, which is just like a
probabilistic spam filter, but trained on corpora of stupid and
non-stupid comments instead.<br><br>You may not have to kill bad comments to solve the problem.  Comments
at the bottom of a long thread are rarely seen, so it may be enough
to incorporate a prediction of quality in the comment sorting
algorithm.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]

Maybe.</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">February 2009<br><br>A lot of cities look at Silicon Valley and ask &quot;How could we make
something like that happen here?&quot;  The 
<a href="siliconvalley.html">organic</a> way to do it is to
establish a first-rate university in a place where rich people want
to live. That&apos;s how Silicon Valley happened.  But could you shortcut
the process by funding startups?<br><br>Possibly. Let&apos;s consider what it would take.<br><br>The first thing to understand is that encouraging startups is a
different problem from encouraging startups in a particular city.
The latter is much more expensive.<br><br>People sometimes think they could improve the startup scene in their
town by starting something like <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y 
Combinator</a> there, but in fact it
will have near zero effect.  I know because Y Combinator itself had
near zero effect on Boston when we were based there half the year.
The people we funded came from all over the country (indeed, the
world) and afterward they went wherever they could get more
funding&#x2014;which generally meant Silicon Valley.<br><br>The seed funding business is not a regional business, because at
that stage startups are mobile. They&apos;re just a couple founders with
laptops. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you want to encourage startups in a particular city, you have
to fund startups that won&apos;t leave.  There are two ways to do that:
have rules preventing them from leaving, or fund them at the point
in their life when they naturally take root.  The first approach
is a mistake, because it becomes a filter for selecting bad startups.
If your terms force startups to do things they don&apos;t want to, only
the desperate ones will take your money.<br><br>Good startups will move to another city as a condition of funding.
What they won&apos;t do is agree not to move the next time they need
funding.  So the only way to get them to stay is to give them enough
that they never need to leave.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>How much would that take?  If you want to keep startups from leaving
your town, you have to give them enough that they&apos;re not tempted
by an offer from Silicon Valley VCs that requires them to move.  A
startup would be able to refuse such an offer if they had grown to
the point where they were (a) rooted in your town and/or (b) so
successful that VCs would fund them even if they didn&apos;t move.<br><br>How much would it cost to grow a startup to that point? A minimum
of several hundred thousand dollars.  <a href="http://wufoo.com">Wufoo</a> 
seem to have rooted
themselves in Tampa on $118k, but they&apos;re an extreme case.  On
average it would take at least half a million.<br><br>So if it seems too good to be true to think you could grow a local
silicon valley by giving startups $15-20k each like Y Combinator,
that&apos;s because it is.  To make them stick around you&apos;d have to give
them at least 20 times that much.<br><br>However, even that is an interesting prospect.  Suppose to be on
the safe side it would cost a million dollars per startup. If you
could get startups to stick to your town for a million apiece, then
for a billion dollars you could bring in a thousand startups. That probably wouldn&apos;t push you past Silicon Valley itself, 
but it might get you second place.<br><br>For the price of a football stadium, any town that was decent to
live in could make itself one of the biggest startup hubs in the
world.<br><br>What&apos;s more, it wouldn&apos;t take very long.   You could probably do
it in five years.  During the term of one mayor. And it would get
easier over time, because the more startups you had in town, the
less it would take to get new ones to move there. By the time you
had a thousand startups in town, the VCs wouldn&apos;t be trying so hard
to get them to move to Silicon Valley; instead they&apos;d be opening
local offices.  Then you&apos;d really be in good shape.  You&apos;d have
started a self-sustaining chain reaction like the one that drives
the Valley.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>But now comes the hard part.  You have to pick the startups.  How
do you do that?  Picking startups is a rare and valuable skill, and
the handful of people who have it are not readily hireable.  And
this skill is so hard to measure that if a government did try to
hire people with it, they&apos;d almost certainly get the wrong ones.<br><br>For example, a city could give money to a VC fund to establish a
local branch, and let them make the choices.  But only a bad VC
fund would take that deal.  They wouldn&apos;t <i>seem</i> bad to the city
officials.  They&apos;d seem very impressive.  But they&apos;d be bad at
picking startups.  That&apos;s the characteristic failure mode of VCs.
All VCs look impressive to limited partners.  The difference between
the good ones and the bad ones only becomes visible in the other
half of their jobs: choosing and advising startups.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>What you really want is a pool of local angel investors&#x2014;people
investing money they made from their own startups.  But unfortunately
you run into a chicken and egg problem here.  If your city isn&apos;t
already a startup hub, there won&apos;t be people there who got rich
from startups. And there is no way I can think of that a city could
attract angels from outside. By definition they&apos;re rich.  There&apos;s
no incentive that would make them move.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>However, a city could select startups by piggybacking on the expertise
of investors who weren&apos;t local.  It would be pretty straightforward
to make a list of the most eminent Silicon Valley angels and from
that to generate a list of all the startups they&apos;d invested in.  If
a city offered these companies a million dollars each to move, a
lot of the earlier stage ones would probably take it.<br><br>Preposterous as this plan sounds, it&apos;s probably the most efficient
way a city could select good startups.<br><br>It would hurt the startups somewhat to be separated from their
original investors. On the other hand, the extra million dollars
would give them a lot more runway.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>Would the transplanted startups survive?  Quite possibly. The only
way to find out would be to try it.  It would be a pretty cheap
experiment, as civil expenditures go.  Pick 30 startups that eminent
angels have recently invested in, give them each a million dollars
if they&apos;ll relocate to your city, and see what happens after a year.
If they seem to be thriving, you can try importing startups on a
larger scale.<br><br>Don&apos;t be too legalistic about the conditions under which they&apos;re
allowed to leave.  Just have a gentlemen&apos;s agreement.<br><br>Don&apos;t try to do it on the cheap and pick only 10 for the initial
experiment.  If you do this on too small a scale you&apos;ll just guarantee
failure. Startups need to be around other startups.  30 would be
enough to feel like a community.<br><br>Don&apos;t try to make them all work in some renovated warehouse you&apos;ve
made into an &quot;incubator.&quot;  Real startups prefer to work in their
own spaces.<br><br>In fact, don&apos;t impose any restrictions on the startups at all.
Startup founders are mostly <a href="gba.html">hackers</a>, 
and hackers are much more
constrained by gentlemen&apos;s agreements than regulations.  If they
shake your hand on a promise, they&apos;ll keep it.  But show them a
lock and their first thought is how to pick it.<br><br>Interestingly, the 30-startup experiment could be done by any
sufficiently rich private citizen.  And what pressure it would 
put on the city if it worked.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><center>___</center><br><br>Should the city take stock in return for the money?
In principle they&apos;re entitled to, but how would they choose valuations
for the startups?  You couldn&apos;t just give them all the same valuation:
that would be too low for some (who&apos;d turn you down) and too high
for others (because it might make their next round a &quot;down round&quot;).
And since we&apos;re assuming we&apos;re doing this without being able to
pick startups, we also have to assume we can&apos;t value them, since
that&apos;s practically the same thing.<br><br>Another reason not to take stock in the startups is that startups
are often involved in disreputable things.  So are established
companies, but they don&apos;t get blamed for it.  If someone gets
murdered by someone they met on Facebook, the press will treat the
story as if it were about Facebook.  If someone gets murdered by
someone they met at a supermarket, the press will just treat it as
a story about a murder.  So understand that if you invest in startups,
they might build things that get used for pornography, or file-sharing,
or the expression of unfashionable opinions.  You should probably
sponsor this project jointly with your political opponents, so they
can&apos;t use whatever the startups do as a club to beat you with.<br><br>It would be too much of a political liability just to give
the startups the money, though.  So the best plan would be to 
make it convertible debt, but which didn&apos;t convert except in
a really big round, like $20 million.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>How well this scheme worked would depend on the 
<a href="cities.html">city</a>.  There are
some towns, like Portland, that would be easy to turn into startup
hubs, and others, like Detroit, where it would really be an uphill
battle.  So be honest with yourself about the sort of town you have
before you try this.<br><br>It will be easier in proportion to how much your town resembles San
Francisco.  Do you have good weather?  Do people live downtown, or
have they abandoned the center for the suburbs?  Would the city be
described as &quot;hip&quot; and &quot;tolerant,&quot; or as reflecting &quot;traditional
values?&quot;  Are there good universities nearby?  Are there walkable
neighborhoods?  Would nerds feel at home?  If you answered yes to
all these questions, you might be able not only to pull off this
scheme, but to do it for less than a million per startup.<br><br>I realize the chance of any city having
the political will to carry out this plan is microscopically
small.  I just wanted to explore what it would take if one did.
How hard would it be to jumpstart a silicon valley?  It&apos;s
fascinating to think this prize might be within
the reach of so many cities.  So even though they&apos;ll all still
spend the money on the stadium, at least now someone can ask them:
why did you choose to do that instead of becoming a serious
rival to Silicon Valley?<br><br><br><br><br><br>

What people who start these supposedly local seed firms always
find is that (a) their applicants come from all over, not just the
local area, and (b) the local startups also apply to the other seed
firms.  So what ends up happening is that the applicant pool gets
partitioned by quality rather than geography.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Interestingly, the bad VCs fail by choosing startups run by
people like them&#x2014;people who are good presenters, but have no
real substance.   It&apos;s a case of the fake leading the fake.  And
since everyone involved is so plausible, the LPs who invest in these
funds have no idea what&apos;s happening till they measure their returns.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Not even being a tax haven, I suspect.  That makes some rich
people move, but not the type who would make good angel investors
in startups.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]

collision course and started to speculate about what they&apos;d produce
when they converged.  We now know the answer: computers.  It&apos;s clear
now that even by using the word &quot;convergence&quot; we were giving TV too
much credit.  This won&apos;t be convergence so much as replacement.
People may still watch things they call &quot;TV shows,&quot; but they&apos;ll
watch them mostly on computers.<br><br>What decided the contest for computers?  Four forces, three of which
one could have predicted, and one that would have been harder to.<br><br>One predictable cause of victory is that the Internet is an open
platform.  Anyone can build whatever they want on it, and the market
picks the winners.  So innovation happens at hacker speeds instead
of big company speeds.<br><br>The second is Moore&apos;s Law, which has worked its usual magic on
Internet bandwidth. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The third reason computers won is piracy. Users prefer it 
not just because it&apos;s free, but because it&apos;s
more convenient.  Bittorrent and YouTube have already trained a new
generation of viewers that the place to watch shows is on a computer
screen.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The somewhat more surprising force was one specific type of innovation:
social applications.  The average teenage kid has a pretty much
infinite capacity for talking to their friends.  But they can&apos;t
physically be with them all the time.  When I was in high school
the solution was the telephone.  Now it&apos;s social networks, multiplayer
games, and various messaging applications.  The way you reach them
all is through a computer.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Which means every teenage kid (a)
wants a computer with an Internet connection, (b) has an incentive
to figure out how to use it, and (c) spends countless hours in front
of it.<br><br>This was the most powerful force of all.  This was what made everyone
want computers.  Nerds got computers because they liked them.  Then
gamers got them to play games on.  But it was connecting to other
people that got everyone else: that&apos;s what made even grandmas and
14 year old girls want computers.
<!--
Computers still aren't really ready for prime time.  I'm pretty
comfortable with technology, but I would be horrified at the prospect
of having to deal with the virus-ridden Windows machine the average
person uses.  I can't believe they put up with it.  But they will
to reach their friends.--><br><br>After decades of running an IV drip right into their audience,
people in the entertainment business had understandably come to
think of them as rather passive.  They thought they&apos;d be able to
dictate the way shows reached audiences.  But they underestimated
the force of their desire to connect with one another.<br><br>Facebook killed TV.  That is wildly oversimplified, of course, but
probably as close to the truth as you can get in three words.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>The TV networks already seem, grudgingly, to see where things are
going, and have responded by putting their stuff, grudgingly, online.
But they&apos;re still dragging their heels.  They still seem to wish
people would watch shows on TV instead, just as newspapers that put
their stories online still seem to wish people would wait till the
next morning and read them printed on paper.  They should both just
face the fact that the Internet is the primary medium.<br><br>They&apos;d be in a better position if they&apos;d done that earlier.  When
a new medium arises that&apos;s powerful enough to make incumbents
nervous, then it&apos;s probably powerful enough to win, and the best
thing they can do is jump in immediately.<br><br>Whether they like it or not, big changes are coming, because the
Internet dissolves the two cornerstones of broadcast media:
synchronicity and locality.  On the Internet, you don&apos;t have to
send everyone the same signal, and you don&apos;t have to send it to
them from a local source.  People will watch what they want when
they want it, and group themselves according to whatever shared
interest they feel most strongly.  Maybe their strongest shared
interest will be their physical location, but I&apos;m guessing not.
Which means local TV is probably dead.  It was an artifact of
limitations imposed by old technology.  If someone were creating
an Internet-based TV company from scratch now, they might have some
plan for shows aimed at specific regions, but it wouldn&apos;t be a top
priority.<br><br>Synchronicity and locality are tied together.  TV network affiliates
care what&apos;s on at 10 because that delivers viewers for local news
at 11.  This connection adds more brittleness than strength, however:
people don&apos;t watch what&apos;s on at 10 because they want to watch the
news afterward.<br><br>TV networks will fight these trends, because they don&apos;t have
sufficient flexibility to adapt to them.  They&apos;re hemmed in by local
affiliates in much the same way car companies are hemmed in by
dealers and unions.  Inevitably, the people running the networks
will take the easy route and try to keep the old model running for
a couple more years, just as the record labels have done.<br><br>A recent article in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> described how TV networks
were trying to add more live shows, partly as a way to make viewers
watch TV synchronously instead of watching recorded shows when it
suited them.  Instead of delivering what viewers want, they&apos;re
trying to force them to change their habits to suit the networks&apos;
obsolete business model.  That never works unless you have a monopoly
or cartel to enforce it, and even then it only works temporarily.<br><br>The other reason networks like live shows is that they&apos;re cheaper
to produce.  There they have the right idea, but they haven&apos;t
followed it to its conclusion.   Live content can be way cheaper
than networks realize, and the way to take advantage of dramatic
decreases in cost is to 
<a href="http://justin.tv">increase volume</a>.  The networks are prevented
from seeing this whole line of reasoning because they still think
of themselves as being in the broadcast business&#x2014;as sending one
signal to everyone.

TV networks.  That&apos;s what a lot of Internet startups are, though
they may not have had this as an explicit goal.  People only have
so many leisure hours a day, and TV is premised on such long sessions
(unlike Google, which prides itself on sending users on their way
quickly) that anything that takes up their time is competing with
it.  But in addition to such indirect competitors, I think TV
companies will increasingly face direct ones.<br><br>Even in cable TV, the long tail was lopped off prematurely by the
threshold you had to get over to start a new channel.  It will be
longer on the Internet, and there will be more mobility within it.
In this new world, the existing players will only have the advantages
any big company has in its market.<br><br>That will change the balance of power between the networks and the
people who produce shows.  The networks used to be gatekeepers.
They distributed your work, and sold advertising on it.  Now the
people who produce a show can distribute it themselves.  The main
value networks supply now is ad sales.  Which will tend to put them
in the position of service providers rather than publishers.<br><br>Shows will change even more.  On the Internet there&apos;s no reason to
keep their current format, or even the fact that they have a single
format.  Indeed, the more interesting sort of convergence that&apos;s
coming is between shows and games.  But on the question of what
sort of entertainment gets distributed on the Internet in 20 years,
I wouldn&apos;t dare to make any predictions, except that things will
change a lot.  We&apos;ll get whatever the most imaginative people can
cook up.  That&apos;s why the Internet won.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Thanks to Trevor Blackwell for this point.  He adds: &quot;I
remember the eyes of phone companies gleaming in the early 90s when
they talked about convergence.  They thought most programming would
be on demand, and they would implement it and make a lot of money.
It didn&apos;t work out. They assumed that their local network infrastructure
would be critical to do video on-demand, because you couldn&apos;t
possibly stream it from a few data centers over the internet. At
the time (1992) the entire cross-country Internet bandwidth wasn&apos;t
enough for one video stream. But wide-area bandwidth increased more
than they expected and they were beaten by iTunes and Hulu.&quot;<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Copyright owners tend to focus on the aspect they see of
piracy, which is the lost revenue.  They therefore think what drives
users to do it is the desire to get something for free.  But iTunes
shows that people will pay for stuff online, if you make it easy.
A significant component of piracy is simply that it offers a better
user experience.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Or a phone that is actually a computer.  I&apos;m not making any
predictions about the size of the device that will replace TV, just
that it will have a browser and get data via the Internet.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]

investing.  Seven years later I still hadn&apos;t started.  I put it off
because it seemed mysterious and complicated.   It turns out to be 
easier than I expected, and also more interesting.<br><br>The part I thought was hard, the mechanics of investing, really
isn&apos;t. You give a startup money and they give you stock.  You&apos;ll
probably get either preferred stock, which means stock with extra
rights like getting your money back first in a sale, or convertible
debt, which means (on paper) you&apos;re lending the company money, and
the debt converts to stock at the next sufficiently big funding
round. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>There are sometimes minor tactical advantages to using one or the
other.  The paperwork for convertible debt is simpler.  But really
it doesn&apos;t matter much which you use.  Don&apos;t spend much time worrying
about the details of deal terms, especially when you first start
angel investing.  That&apos;s not how you win at this game.  When you
hear people talking about a successful angel investor, they&apos;re not
saying &quot;He got a 4x liquidation preference.&quot; They&apos;re saying &quot;He
invested in Google.&quot;<br><br>That&apos;s how you win: by investing in the right startups.  That is
so much more important than anything else that I worry I&apos;m misleading
you by even talking about other things.<br><br><b>Mechanics</b><br><br>Angel investors often syndicate deals, which means they join together
to invest on the same terms.  In a syndicate there is usually a
&quot;lead&quot; investor who negotiates the terms with the startup.  But not
always: sometimes the startup cobbles together a syndicate of
investors who approach them independently, and the startup&apos;s lawyer
supplies the paperwork.<br><br>The easiest way to get started in angel investing is to find a
friend who already does it, and try to get included in his syndicates.
Then all you have to do is write checks.<br><br>Don&apos;t feel like you have to join a syndicate, though.  It&apos;s not that
hard to do it yourself.  You can just use the standard 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html">series AA</a>
documents Wilson Sonsini and Y Combinator published online.
You should of course have your lawyer review everything.  Both you
and the startup should have lawyers.  But the lawyers don&apos;t have
to create the agreement from scratch.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>
When you negotiate terms with a startup, there are two numbers you
care about: how much money you&apos;re putting in, and the valuation of
the company.  The valuation determines how much stock you get.  If
you put $50,000 into a company at a pre-money valuation of $1
million, then the post-money valuation is $1.05 million, and you
get .05/1.05, or 4.76% of the company&apos;s stock.<br><br>If the company raises more money later, the new investor will take
a chunk of the company away from all the existing shareholders just
as you did.  If in the next round they sell 10% of the company to
a new investor, your 4.76% will be reduced to 4.28%.<br><br>That&apos;s ok.  Dilution is normal.  What saves you from being mistreated
in future rounds, usually, is that you&apos;re in the same boat as the
founders.  They can&apos;t dilute you without diluting themselves just
as much.  And they won&apos;t dilute themselves unless they end up 
<a href="equity.html">net ahead</a>.  So in theory, each further 
round of investment leaves you
with a smaller share of an even more valuable company, till after
several more rounds you end up with .5% of the company at the point
where it IPOs, and you are very happy because your $50,000 has
become $5 million. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The agreement by which you invest should have provisions that 
let you contribute to
future rounds to maintain your percentage.  So it&apos;s your choice
whether you get diluted.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
If the company does really well,
you eventually will, because eventually the valuations will get so
high it&apos;s not worth it for you.<br><br>How much does an angel invest?  That varies enormously, from $10,000
to hundreds of thousands or in rare cases even millions.  The upper
bound is obviously the total amount the founders want to raise.
The lower bound is 5-10% of the total or $10,000, whichever
is greater.  A typical angel round these days might be $150,000
raised from 5 people.<br><br>Valuations don&apos;t vary as much.  For angel rounds it&apos;s rare to see
a valuation lower than half a million or higher than 4 or 5 million.
4 million is starting to be VC territory.<br><br>How do you decide what valuation to offer?  If you&apos;re part of a
round led by someone else, that problem is solved for you.  But
what if you&apos;re investing by yourself?  There&apos;s no real answer.
There is no rational way to value an early stage startup.  The
valuation reflects nothing more than the strength of the company&apos;s
bargaining position.  If they really want you, either because they
desperately need money, or you&apos;re someone who can help them a lot,
they&apos;ll let you invest at a low valuation.  If they don&apos;t need you,
it will be higher.  So guess.  The startup may not have any more
idea what the number should be than you do. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Ultimately it doesn&apos;t matter much.  When angels make a lot of money
from a deal, it&apos;s not because they invested at a valuation of $1.5
million instead of $3 million.  It&apos;s because the company was really
successful.<br><br>I can&apos;t emphasize that too much.  Don&apos;t get hung up on mechanics
or deal terms.  What you should spend your time thinking about is
whether the company is good.<br><br>(Similarly, founders also should not get hung up on deal
terms, but should spend their time thinking about how to make the
company good.)<br><br>There&apos;s a second less obvious component of an angel investment: how
much you&apos;re expected to help the startup.  Like the amount you
invest, this can vary a lot.  You don&apos;t have to do anything if you
don&apos;t want to; you could simply be a source of money.  Or you can
become a de facto employee of the company.  Just make sure that you
and the startup agree in advance about roughly how much you&apos;ll do
for them.<br><br>Really hot companies sometimes have high standards for angels.  The
ones everyone wants to invest in practically audition investors,
and only take money from people who are famous and/or will work
hard for them.  But don&apos;t feel like you have to put in a lot of
time or you won&apos;t get to invest in any good startups.  There is a
surprising lack of correlation between how hot a deal a startup is
and how well it ends up doing.  Lots of hot startups will end up
failing, and lots of startups no one likes will end up succeeding.
And the latter are so desperate for money that they&apos;ll take it from
anyone at a low valuation. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Picking Winners</b><br><br>It would be nice to be able to pick those out, wouldn&apos;t it?  The
part of angel investing that has most effect on your returns, picking
the right companies, is also the hardest.  So you should practically
ignore (or more precisely, archive, in the Gmail sense) everything
I&apos;ve told you so far.  You may need to refer to it at some point,
but it is not the central issue.<br><br>The central issue is picking the right startups.  What &quot;Make something
people want&quot; is for startups, &quot;Pick the right startups&quot; is for
investors.  Combined they yield &quot;Pick the startups that will make
something people want.&quot;<br><br>How do you do that?  It&apos;s not as simple as picking startups that
are already making something wildly popular.  By then it&apos;s
too late for angels.  VCs will already be onto them.  As an angel,
you have to pick startups before they&apos;ve got a hit&#x2014;either
because they&apos;ve made something great but users don&apos;t realize it
yet, like Google early on, or because they&apos;re still an iteration
or two away from the big hit, like Paypal when they were making
software for transferring money between PDAs.<br><br>To be a good angel investor, you have to be a good judge of potential.
That&apos;s what it comes down to.  VCs can be fast followers.  Most of
them don&apos;t try to predict what will win.  They just try to notice
quickly when something already is winning.  But angels have to be
able to predict.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>One interesting consequence of this fact is that there are a lot
of people out there who have never even made an angel investment
and yet are already better angel investors than they realize.
Someone who doesn&apos;t know the first thing about the mechanics of
venture funding but knows what a successful startup founder looks
like is actually far ahead of someone who knows termsheets inside
out, but thinks 
<a href="gba.html">&quot;hacker&quot;</a> means someone who breaks into computers.
If you can recognize good startup founders by empathizing with
them&#x2014;if you both resonate at the same frequency&#x2014;then
you may already be a better startup picker than the median professional
VC.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>Paul Buchheit, for example, started angel investing about a year
after me, and he was pretty much immediately as good as me at picking
startups.  My extra year of experience was rounding error compared
to our ability to empathize with founders.<br><br>What makes a good founder?  If there were a word that meant the
opposite of hapless, that would be the one.  Bad founders seem
hapless.  They may be smart, or not, but somehow events overwhelm
them and they get discouraged and give up.  Good founders make
things happen the way they want.  Which is not to say they force
things to happen in a predefined way.  Good founders have a healthy
respect for reality.  But they are relentlessly resourceful.  That&apos;s
the closest I can get to the opposite of hapless.  You want to fund
people who are relentlessly resourceful.<br><br>Notice we started out talking about things, and now we&apos;re talking
about people.  There is an ongoing debate between investors which
is more important, the people, or the idea&#x2014;or more precisely,
the market. Some, like Ron Conway, say it&apos;s the people&#x2014;that
the idea will change, but the people are the foundation of the
company.  Whereas Marc Andreessen says he&apos;d back ok founders in a
hot market over great founders in a bad one.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>These two positions are not so far apart as they seem, because good
people find good markets.  Bill Gates would probably have ended up
pretty rich even if IBM hadn&apos;t happened to drop the PC standard in
his lap.<br><br>I&apos;ve thought a lot about the disagreement between the investors who
prefer to bet on people and those who prefer to bet on markets.
It&apos;s kind of surprising that it even exists.  You&apos;d expect opinions
to have converged more.<br><br>But I think I&apos;ve figured out what&apos;s going on.  The three most
prominent people I know who favor markets are Marc, Jawed Karim,
and Joe Kraus.  And all three of them, in their own startups,
basically flew into a thermal: they hit a market growing so fast
that it was all they could do to keep up with it.  That kind of
experience is hard to ignore.  Plus I think they underestimate
themselves: they think back to how easy it felt to ride that huge
thermal upward, and they think &quot;anyone could have done it.&quot;  But
that isn&apos;t true; they are not ordinary people.<br><br>So as an angel investor I think you want to go with Ron Conway and
bet on people.  Thermals happen, yes, but no one can predict
them&#x2014;not even the founders, and certainly not you as an
investor.  And only good people can ride the thermals if they hit
them anyway.<br><br><b>Deal Flow</b><br><br>Of course the question of how to choose startups presumes you
have startups to choose between.  How do you find them?  This is
yet another problem that gets solved for you by syndicates.  If you
tag along on a friend&apos;s investments, you don&apos;t have to find startups.<br><br>The problem is not finding startups, exactly, but finding a stream
of reasonably high quality ones.  The traditional way to do this
is through contacts.  If you&apos;re friends with a lot of investors and
founders, they&apos;ll send deals your way.  The Valley basically runs
on referrals.  And once you start to become known as reliable,
useful investor, people will refer lots of deals to you.  I certainly
will.<br><br>There&apos;s also a newer way to find startups, which is to come to
events like Y Combinator&apos;s Demo Day, where a batch of newly created
startups presents to investors all at once.   We have two Demo Days
a year, one in March and one in August.  These are basically mass
referrals.<br><br>But events like Demo Day only account for a fraction of matches
between startups and investors.  The personal referral is still the
most common route.  So if you want to hear about new startups, the
best way to do it is to get lots of referrals.<br><br>The best way to get lots of referrals is to invest in startups.  No
matter how smart and nice you seem, insiders will be reluctant to
send you referrals until you&apos;ve proven yourself by doing a couple
investments.  Some smart, nice guys turn out to be flaky,
high-maintenance investors. But once you prove yourself as a good
investor, the deal flow, as they call it, will increase rapidly in
both quality and quantity.  At the extreme, for someone like Ron
Conway, it is basically identical with the deal flow of the whole
Valley.<br><br>So if you want to invest seriously, the way to get started is to
bootstrap yourself off your existing connections, be a good investor
in the startups you meet that way, and eventually you&apos;ll start a
chain reaction.  Good investors are rare, even in Silicon Valley.
There probably aren&apos;t more than a couple hundred serious angels in the whole
Valley, and yet they&apos;re probably the single most important ingredient
in making the Valley what it is.  Angels are the limiting reagent
in startup formation.<br><br>If there are only a couple hundred serious angels in the Valley, 
then by deciding to become one you could single-handedly make the pipeline
for startups in Silicon Valley significantly wider.  That is kind
of mind-blowing.<br><br><b>Being Good</b><br><br>How do you be a good angel investor?  The first thing you need is
to be decisive.  When we talk to founders about good and bad
investors, one of the ways we describe the good ones is to say &quot;he
writes checks.&quot; That doesn&apos;t mean the investor says yes to everyone.
Far from it.  It means he makes up his mind quickly,
and follows through.  You may be thinking, how hard could that be?
You&apos;ll see when you try it.  It follows from the nature of angel
investing that the decisions are hard.  You have to guess early,
at the stage when the most promising ideas still seem counterintuitive,
because if they were obviously good, VCs would already have funded
them.<br><br>Suppose it&apos;s 1998.  You come across a startup founded by a couple
grad students.  They say they&apos;re going to work on Internet search.
There are already a bunch of big public companies doing search.
How can these grad students possibly compete with them?  And does
search even matter anyway?  All the search engines are trying to
get people to start calling them &quot;portals&quot; instead.  Why would you
want to invest in a startup run by a couple of nobodies who are
trying to compete with large, aggressive companies in an area they
themselves have declared passe?  And yet the grad students seem
pretty smart.  What do you do?<br><br>There&apos;s a hack for being decisive when you&apos;re inexperienced: ratchet
down the size of your investment till it&apos;s an amount you wouldn&apos;t
care too much about losing.  For every rich person (you probably
shouldn&apos;t try angel investing unless you think of yourself as rich)
there&apos;s some amount that would be painless, though annoying, to
lose.  Till you feel comfortable investing, don&apos;t invest more than
that per startup.<br><br>For example, if you have $5 million in investable assets, it would
probably be painless (though annoying) to lose $15,000.  That&apos;s
less than .3% of your net worth.  So start by making 3 or 4 $15,000
investments.  Nothing will teach you about angel investing like
experience.  Treat the first few as an educational expense.  $60,000
is less than a lot of graduate programs.  Plus you get equity.<br><br>What&apos;s really uncool is to be strategically indecisive: to string
founders along while trying to gather more information about the
startup&apos;s trajectory. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font>
 There&apos;s always a temptation to do that,
because you just have so little to go on, but you have to consciously
resist it.  In the long term it&apos;s to your advantage to be good.<br><br>The other component of being a good angel investor is simply to be
a good person.  Angel investing is not a business where you make
money by screwing people over.  Startups create wealth, and
creating wealth is not a zero sum game.  No one has to lose for you
to win.  In fact, if you mistreat the founders you invest in, they&apos;ll
just get demoralized and the company will do worse.  Plus your
referrals will dry up.  So I recommend being good.<br><br>The most successful angel investors I know are all basically good
people.  Once they invest in a company, all they want to do is help
it.  And they&apos;ll help people they haven&apos;t invested in too.  When
they do favors they don&apos;t seem to keep track of them.  It&apos;s too
much overhead.  They just try to help everyone, and assume good
things will flow back to them somehow. Empirically that seems to
work.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Convertible debt can be either capped at a particular valuation,
or can be done at a discount to whatever the valuation turns out
to be when it converts.  E.g. convertible debt at a discount of 30%
means when it converts you get stock as if you&apos;d invested at a 30%
lower valuation.  That can be useful in cases where you can&apos;t or
don&apos;t want to figure out what the valuation should be.  You leave
it to the next investor.  On the other hand, a lot of investors
want to know exactly what they&apos;re getting, so they will only do
convertible debt with a cap.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
The expensive part of creating an agreement from scratch is
not writing the agreement, but bickering at several hundred
dollars an hour over the details.  That&apos;s why the series AA paperwork
aims at a middle ground.  You can just start from the compromise
you&apos;d have reached after lots of back and forth.<br><br>When you fund a startup, both your lawyers should be specialists
in startups.  Do not use ordinary corporate lawyers for this.  Their
inexperience makes them overbuild: they&apos;ll create huge, overcomplicated
agreements, and spend hours arguing over irrelevant things.<br><br>In the Valley, the top startup law firms are Wilson Sonsini, Orrick,
Fenwick &amp; West, Gunderson Dettmer, and Cooley Godward.  In Boston
the best are Goodwin Procter, Wilmer Hale, and Foley Hoag.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Your mileage may vary.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
These anti-dilution provisions also protect you against
tricks like a later investor trying to steal the company by doing
another round that values the company at $1.  If you have a competent
startup lawyer handle the deal for you, you should be protected
against such tricks initially.  But it could become a problem later.
If a big VC firm wants to invest in the startup after you, they may
try to make you take out your anti-dilution protections.  And if
they do the startup will be pressuring you to agree.  They&apos;ll tell
you that if you don&apos;t, you&apos;re going to kill their deal with the VC.
I recommend you solve this problem by having a gentlemen&apos;s agreement
with the founders: agree with them in advance that you&apos;re not going
to give up your anti-dilution protections.  Then it&apos;s up to them
to tell VCs early on.<br><br>The reason you don&apos;t want to give them up is the following scenario.
The VCs recapitalize the company, meaning they give it additional
funding at a pre-money valuation of zero.  This wipes out the
existing shareholders, including both you and the founders.  They
then grant the founders lots of options, because they need them to
stay around, but you get nothing.<br><br>Obviously this is not a nice thing to do.  It doesn&apos;t happen often.
Brand-name VCs wouldn&apos;t recapitalize a company just to steal a few
percent from an angel.  But there&apos;s a continuum here.  A less
upstanding, lower-tier VC might be tempted to do it to steal a big
chunk of stock.<br><br>I&apos;m not saying you should always absolutely refuse to give up your
anti-dilution protections.  Everything is a negotiation.  If you&apos;re
part of a powerful syndicate, you might be able to give up legal
protections and rely on social ones.  If you invest in a deal led
by a big angel like Ron Conway, for example, you&apos;re pretty well
protected against being mistreated, because any VC would think twice
before crossing him.  This kind of protection is one of the reasons
angels like to invest in syndicates.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Don&apos;t invest so much, or at such a low valuation, that you
end up with an excessively large share of a startup, unless you&apos;re
sure your money will be the last they ever need.  Later stage
investors won&apos;t invest in a company if the founders don&apos;t have
enough equity left to motivate them.  I talked to a VC recently who
said he&apos;d met with a company he really liked, but he turned
them down because investors already owned more than half of it.
Those investors probably thought they&apos;d been pretty clever by getting
such a large chunk of this desirable company, but in fact they were
shooting themselves in the foot.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
At any given time I know of at least 3 or 4 YC alumni who I
believe will be big successes but who are running on vapor,
financially, because investors don&apos;t yet get what they&apos;re doing.
(And no, unfortunately, I can&apos;t tell you who they are.  I can&apos;t
refer a startup to an investor I don&apos;t know.)<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
There are some VCs who can predict instead of reacting.  Not
surprisingly, these are the most successful ones.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
It&apos;s somewhat sneaky of me to put it this way, because the
median VC loses money.  That&apos;s one of the most surprising things
I&apos;ve learned about VC while working on Y Combinator.  Only a fraction
of VCs even have positive returns.  The rest exist to satisfy demand
among fund managers for venture capital as an asset class.  Learning
this explained a lot about some of the VCs I encountered when we
were working on Viaweb.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
VCs also generally say they prefer great markets to great
people.  But what they&apos;re really saying is they want both.  They&apos;re
so selective that they only even consider great people.  So when
they say they care above all about big markets, they mean that&apos;s
how they choose between great people.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
Founders rightly dislike the sort of investor who says he&apos;s
interested in investing but doesn&apos;t want to lead.  There are
circumstances where this is an acceptable excuse, but more often
than not what it means is &quot;No, but if you turn out to be a hot deal,
I want to be able to claim retroactively I said yes.&quot;<br><br>If you like a startup enough to invest in it, then invest in it.
Just use the standard <a href="http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html">series

March 2009<br><br>A couple days ago I finally got being a good startup founder down
to two words:  relentlessly resourceful.<br><br>Till then the best I&apos;d managed was to get the opposite quality down
to one: hapless.  Most dictionaries say hapless means unlucky.  But
the dictionaries are not doing a very good job.  A team that outplays
its opponents but loses because of a bad decision by the referee
could be called unlucky, but not hapless.  Hapless implies passivity.
To be hapless is to be battered by circumstances&#x2014;to let the world
have its way with you, instead of having your way with the world.
<!--Unlucky is a bad synonym, because it emphasizes the role of chance
in bad outcomes.  Hapless overlaps more with the other component
of bad outcomes, the half that makes them deserved. -->
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Unfortunately there&apos;s no antonym of hapless, which makes it difficult
to tell founders what to aim for.  &quot;Don&apos;t be hapless&quot; is not much
of rallying cry.<br><br>It&apos;s not hard to express the quality we&apos;re looking for in metaphors.
The best is probably a running back.  A good running back is not
merely determined, but flexible as well.  They want to get downfield,
but they adapt their plans on the fly.<br><br>Unfortunately this is just a metaphor, and not a useful one to most
people outside the US.   &quot;Be like a running back&quot; is no better than
&quot;Don&apos;t be hapless.&quot;<br><br>But finally I&apos;ve figured out how to express this quality directly.
I was writing a talk for 
<a href="angelinvesting.html">investors</a>, and I had to explain what to
look for in founders.  What would someone who was the opposite of
hapless be like?  They&apos;d be relentlessly resourceful.  Not merely
relentless.  That&apos;s not enough to make things go your way except
in a few mostly uninteresting domains.  In any interesting domain,
the difficulties will be novel.  Which means you can&apos;t simply plow
through them, because you don&apos;t know initially how hard they are;
you don&apos;t know whether you&apos;re about to plow through a block of foam
or granite.  So you have to be resourceful. You have to keep
trying new things.<br><br>Be relentlessly resourceful.<br><br>That sounds right, but is it simply a description
of how to be successful in general?  I don&apos;t think so.  This isn&apos;t
the recipe for success in writing or painting, for example.  In
that kind of work the recipe is more to be actively curious.
Resourceful implies the obstacles are external, which they generally
are in startups. But in writing and painting they&apos;re mostly internal;
the obstacle is your own obtuseness.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>There probably are other fields where &quot;relentlessly resourceful&quot;
is the recipe for success.  But though other fields may share it,
I think this is the best short description we&apos;ll find of what makes
a good startup founder.  I doubt it could be made more precise.<br><br>Now that we know what we&apos;re looking for, that leads to other
questions.  For example, can this quality be taught?  After four
years of trying to teach it to people, I&apos;d say that yes, surprisingly
often it can.  Not to everyone, but to many people. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Some
people are just constitutionally passive, but others have a latent
ability to be relentlessly resourceful that only needs to be brought
out.<br><br>This is particularly true of young people who have till now always
been under the thumb of some kind of authority.  Being relentlessly
resourceful is definitely not the recipe for success in big companies,
or in most schools.  I don&apos;t even want to think what the recipe is
in big companies, but it is certainly longer and messier, involving
some combination of resourcefulness, obedience, and building
alliances.<br><br>Identifying this quality also brings us closer to answering a
question people often wonder about: how many startups there could
be.  There is not, as some people seem to think, any economic upper
bound on this number.  There&apos;s no reason to believe there is any
limit on the amount of newly created wealth consumers can absorb,
any more than there is a limit on the number of theorems that can
be proven.  So probably the limiting factor on the number of startups
is the pool of potential founders.  Some people would make good
founders, and others wouldn&apos;t.  And now that we can say what makes
a good founder, we know how to put an upper bound on the size of
the pool.<br><br>This test is also useful to individuals.  If you want to know whether
you&apos;re the right sort of person to start a startup, ask yourself
whether you&apos;re relentlessly resourceful.  And if you want to know
whether to recruit someone as a cofounder, ask if they are.<br><br>You can even use it tactically.  If I were running a startup, this
would be the phrase I&apos;d tape to the mirror.  &quot;Make something people
want&quot; is the destination, but &quot;Be relentlessly resourceful&quot; is how
you get there.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I think the reason the dictionaries are wrong is that the
meaning of the word has shifted.  No one writing a dictionary from
scratch today would say that hapless meant unlucky.  But a couple
hundred years ago they might have.  People were more at the mercy
of circumstances in the past, and as a result a lot of the words
we use for good and bad outcomes have origins in words about luck.<br><br>When I was living in Italy, I was once trying to tell someone
that I hadn&apos;t had much success in doing something, but I couldn&apos;t
think of the Italian word for success.  I spent some time trying
to describe the word I meant.  Finally she said &quot;Ah! Fortuna!&quot;<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There are aspects of startups where the recipe is to be
actively curious.  There can be times when what you&apos;re doing is
almost pure discovery.  Unfortunately these times are a small
proportion of the whole.  On the other hand, they are in research
too.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
I&apos;d almost say to most people, but I realize (a) I have no
idea what most people are like, and (b) I&apos;m pathologically optimistic
about people&apos;s ability to change.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts

interesting startup founders of the last 30 years.  How do
you decide who&apos;s the most interesting?  The best test seemed
to be influence: who are the 5
who&apos;ve influenced me most?  Who do I use as examples when I&apos;m
talking to companies we fund?  Who do I find myself quoting?<br><br><b>1. Steve Jobs</b><br><br>I&apos;d guess Steve is the most influential founder not just for me but
for most people you could ask.  A lot of startup culture is Apple
culture.  He was the original young founder.  And while the concept
of &quot;insanely great&quot; already existed in the arts, it was a novel
idea to introduce into a company in the 1980s.<br><br>More remarkable still, he&apos;s stayed interesting for 30 years.  People
await new Apple products the way they&apos;d await new books by a popular
novelist.  Steve may not literally design them, but they wouldn&apos;t
happen if he weren&apos;t CEO.<br><br>Steve is clever and driven, but so are a lot of people in the Valley.
What makes him unique is his 
<a href="taste.html">sense of 
design</a>.  Before him, most
companies treated design as a frivolous extra.  Apple&apos;s competitors
now know better.<br><br><b>2. TJ Rodgers</b><br><br>TJ Rodgers isn&apos;t as famous as Steve Jobs, but he may be the best
writer among Silicon Valley CEOs.  I&apos;ve probably learned more from
him about the startup way of thinking than from anyone else.  Not
so much from specific things he&apos;s written as by reconstructing the
mind that produced them: brutally candid; aggressively garbage-collecting
outdated ideas; and yet driven by pragmatism rather than ideology.<br><br>The first essay of his that I read was so electrifying that I
remember exactly where I was at the time.  It was 
<a href="http://www.cypress.com/?rID=34993">High
Technology Innovation: Free Markets or Government Subsidies?</a> and
I was downstairs in the Harvard Square T Station.  It felt as if
someone had flipped on a light switch inside my head.<br><br><b>3. Larry &amp; Sergey</b><br><br>I&apos;m sorry to treat Larry and Sergey as one person.  I&apos;ve always
thought that was unfair to them.  But it does seem as if Google was a
collaboration.<br><br>Before Google, companies in Silicon Valley already knew it was
important to have the best hackers.  So they claimed, at least.
But Google pushed this idea further than anyone had before.  Their
hypothesis seems to have been that, in the initial stages at least,
<i>all</i> you need is good hackers: if you hire all the smartest people
and put them to work on a problem where their success can be measured,
you win.  All the other stuff&#x2014;which includes all the stuff that
business schools think business consists of&#x2014;you can figure out
along the way.  The results won&apos;t be perfect, but they&apos;ll be optimal.
If this was their hypothesis, it&apos;s now been verified experimentally.<br><br><b>4. Paul Buchheit</b><br><br>Few know this, but one person, Paul Buchheit, is responsible for
three of the best things Google has done.  He was the original
author of GMail, which is the most impressive thing Google has after
search.  He also wrote the first prototype of AdSense, and was the
author of Google&apos;s mantra &quot;Don&apos;t be evil.&quot;<br><br>PB made a point in a talk once that I now mention to every startup
we fund: that it&apos;s better, initially, to make a small number of
users really love you than a large number kind of like you.   If I
could tell startups only 
<a href="13sentences.html">ten sentences</a>, 
this would be one of them.<br><br>Now he&apos;s cofounder of a startup called Friendfeed.  It&apos;s only a
year old, but already everyone in the Valley is watching them.
Someone responsible for three of the biggest ideas at Google is
going to come up with more.<br><br><b>5. Sam Altman</b><br><br>I was told I shouldn&apos;t mention founders of YC-funded companies in
this list.   But Sam Altman can&apos;t be stopped by such flimsy rules.
If he wants to be on this list, he&apos;s going to be.<br><br>Honestly, Sam is, along with Steve Jobs, the founder I refer to
most when I&apos;m advising startups.  On questions of design, I ask
&quot;What would Steve do?&quot; but on questions of strategy or ambition I
ask &quot;What would Sama do?&quot;<br><br>What I learned from meeting Sama is that the doctrine of the elect
applies to startups.  It applies way less than most people think:
startup investing does not consist of trying to pick winners the
way you might in a horse race.  But there are a few people with
such force of will that they&apos;re going to get whatever they want.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="foundervisa">The Founder Visa</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0">

April 2009<br><br>I usually avoid politics, but since we now seem to have an administration that&apos;s open to suggestions, I&apos;m going to risk making one.  The single biggest thing the government could do to increase the number of startups in this country is a policy that would cost nothing: establish a new class of visa for <nota 11="" 15="" 2006="" href="href=" http:="" venturebeat.com="" note-to-washington-about-half-of-vc-backed-company-founders-are-immigrants="" "="">startup founders.<br><br>The biggest constraint on the number of new startups that get created in the US is not tax policy or employment law or even Sarbanes-Oxley.  It&apos;s that we won&apos;t let the people who want to start them into the country.<br><br>Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy.  If we assume 4 people per startup, which is probably an overestimate, that&apos;s 2500 new companies.  <i>Each year.</i>  They wouldn&apos;t all grow as big as Google, but out of 2500 some would come close.<br><br>By definition these 10,000 founders wouldn&apos;t be taking jobs from Americans: it could be part of the terms of the visa that they couldn&apos;t work for existing companies, only new ones they&apos;d founded.  In fact they&apos;d cause there to be 
more jobs for Americans, because the companies they started would hire more employees as they grew.<br><br>The tricky part might seem to be how one defined a startup. But that could be solved quite easily: let the market decide.  Startup investors work hard to find the best startups.  The government could not do better than to piggyback on their expertise, and use investment by recognized startup investors as the test of whether a company was a real startup.<br><br>How would the government decide who&apos;s a startup investor?  The same way they decide what counts as a university for student visas. We&apos;ll establish our own accreditation procedure. We know who one another are.<br><br>10,000 people is a drop in the bucket by immigration standards, but would represent a huge increase in the pool of startup founders.  I think this would have such a visible effect on the economy that it would make the legislator who introduced the bill famous.  The only way to know for sure would be to try it, and that would cost practically nothing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

to ask why Twitter is such a big deal.<br><br>The reason is that it&apos;s a new messaging 
protocol, where you don&apos;t specify the recipients.
New protocols are rare.  Or more precisely, new
protocols that take off are.
There are only a handful of commonly used ones: TCP/IP 
(the Internet), SMTP (email), HTTP (the web), and so on.  So any
new protocol is a big deal.  But Twitter is a protocol owned
by a private company.  That&apos;s even rarer.<br><br>Curiously, the fact that the founders of Twitter 
have been slow to monetize it may in the long run
prove to be an advantage.  Because they haven&apos;t tried
to control it too much, Twitter feels to everyone like
previous protocols.  One forgets it&apos;s owned by a
private company.  That must have made it easier for
Twitter to spread.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="revolution">A Local Revolution?</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">April 2009<br><br>Recently I realized I&apos;d been holding two ideas in my head that would explode if combined.<br><br>The first is that startups may represent a <a href="highres.html">new economic phase</a>, on the scale of the Industrial Revolution. I&apos;m not sure of this, but there seems a decent chance it&apos;s true.  People are dramatically more 
<nota href="wealth.html">productive as founders or early employees of startups&#x2014;imagine how much less Larry and Sergey would have achieved if they&apos;d gone to work for a big company&#x2014;and that scale of improvement can change social customs.<br><br>The second idea is that startups are a type of business that flourishes in certain places that <a href="startuphubs.html">specialize</a> in it&#x2014;that Silicon Valley specializes in startups in the same way Los Angeles specializes in movies, or New York in finance. <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>What if both are true?  What if startups are both a new economic phase and also a type of business that only flourishes in certain centers?<br><br>If so, this revolution is going to be particularly revolutionary. All previous revolutions have spread.  Agriculture, cities, and industrialization all spread widely. If startups end up being like the movie business, with just a handful of centers and one dominant one, that&apos;s going to have novel consequences.<br><br>There are already signs that startups may not spread particularly well.  The spread of startups seems to be proceeding slower than the spread of the Industrial Revolution, despite the fact that communication is so much faster now.<br><br>Within a few decades of the founding of Boulton &amp; Watt there were steam engines scattered over northern Europe and North America.  Industrialization didn&apos;t spread much beyond those regions for a while. It only spread to places where there was a strong middle class&#x2014;countries where a private citizen could make a fortune without having it confiscated. Otherwise it wasn&apos;t worth investing in factories.  But in a country with a strong middle class it was easy for industrial techniques to take root.  An individual mine or factory owner could decide to install a steam engine, and within a few years he could probably find someone local to make him one.  So steam engines spread fast.  And they spread widely, because the locations of mines and factories were determined by features like rivers, harbors, and sources of raw materials. 
 <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Startups don&apos;t seem to spread so well, partly because they&apos;re more a social than a technical phenomenon, and partly because they&apos;re not tied to geography.  An individual European manufacturer could import industrial techniques and they&apos;d work fine.  This doesn&apos;t seem to work so well with startups: you need a community of expertise, as you do in the movie business.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
 Plus there aren&apos;t the same forces driving startups to spread.  Once railroads or electric power grids were invented, every region had to have them.  An area without railroads or power was a rich potential market.  But this isn&apos;t true with startups.  There&apos;s no need for a Microsoft of France or Google of Germany.<br><br>Governments may decide they want to encourage startups locally, but government policy can&apos;t call them into being the way a genuine need could.<br><br>How will this all play out?  If I had to predict now, I&apos;d say that startups will spread, but very slowly, because their spread will be driven not by government policies (which won&apos;t work) or by market need (which doesn&apos;t exist) but, to the extent that it happens at all, by the same random factors that have caused startup culture to spread thus far.  And such random factors will increasingly be outweighed by the pull of existing startup hubs.<br><br>Silicon Valley is where it is because William Shockley wanted to move back to Palo Alto, where he grew up, and the experts he lured west to work with him liked it so much they stayed.  Seattle owes much of its position as a tech center to the same cause: Gates and Allen wanted to move home.  Otherwise Albuquerque might have Seattle&apos;s place in the rankings.  Boston is a tech center because it&apos;s the intellectual capital of the US and probably the world.  And if Battery Ventures hadn&apos;t turned down Facebook, Boston would be significantly bigger now on the startup radar screen.<br><br>But of course it&apos;s not a coincidence that Facebook got funded in the Valley and not Boston.  There are more and bolder investors in Silicon Valley than in Boston, and even undergrads know it.<br><br>Boston&apos;s case illustrates the difficulty you&apos;d have establishing a new startup hub this late in the game.  If you wanted to create a startup hub by reproducing the way existing ones happened, the 
<a href="siliconvalley.html">way to do it</a> would be to establish a first-rate research university in a place so nice that rich people wanted to live there.  Then the town would be hospitable to both groups you need: both founders and investors.  That&apos;s the combination that yielded Silicon Valley.  But Silicon Valley didn&apos;t have Silicon Valley to compete with.  If you tried now to create a startup hub by planting a great university in a nice place, it would have a harder time getting started, because many of the best startups it produced would be sucked away to existing startup hubs.<br><br>Recently I suggested a potential shortcut: 
<a href="maybe.html">pay startups to move</a>.  Once you had enough good startups in one place, it would create a self-sustaining chain reaction.  Founders would start to move there without being paid, because that was where their peers were, and investors would appear too, because that was where the deals were.<br><br>In practice I doubt any government would have the balls to try this, or the brains to do it right.  I didn&apos;t mean it as a practical suggestion, but more as an exploration of the lower bound of what it would take to create a startup hub deliberately.<br><br>The most likely scenario is (1) that no government will successfully establish a startup hub, and (2) that the spread of startup culture will thus be driven by the random factors that have driven it so far, but (3) that these factors will be increasingly outweighed by the pull of existing startup hubs.  Result: this revolution, if it is one, will be unusually localized.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

There are two very different types of startup: one kind that evolves naturally, and one kind that&apos;s called into being to &quot;commercialize&quot; a scientific discovery.  Most computer/software startups are now the first type, and most pharmaceutical startups the second.  When I talk about startups in this essay, I mean type I startups.  There is no difficulty making type II startups spread: all you have to do is fund medical research labs; commercializing whatever new discoveries the boffins throw off is as straightforward as building a new airport.  Type II startups neither require nor produce startup culture. But that means having type II startups won&apos;t get you type I startups.  Philadelphia is a case in point: lots of type II startups, but hardly any type I.<br><br>Incidentally, Google may appear to be an instance of a type II startup, but it wasn&apos;t.  Google is not pagerank commercialized.  They could have used another algorithm and everything would have turned out the same.  What made Google Google is that they cared about doing search well at a critical point in the evolution of the web.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
 Watt didn&apos;t invent the steam engine.  His critical invention was a refinement that made steam engines dramatically more efficient: the separate condenser.  But that oversimplifies his role.  He had such a different attitude to the problem and approached it with such energy that he transformed the field.  Perhaps the most accurate way to put it would be to say that Watt reinvented the steam engine.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The biggest counterexample here is Skype.  If you&apos;re doing
something that would get shut down in the US, it becomes an 
advantage to be located elsewhere.  That&apos;s why Kazaa took
the place of Napster.  And the expertise and connections the 
founders gained from running Kazaa helped ensure the success
of Skype.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.<br><br></nota></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="makersschedule">Maker&apos;s Schedule, Manager&apos;s Schedule </h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">
<p>
July 2009<br><br>One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they&apos;re on
a different type of schedule from other people.  Meetings cost them
more.<br><br>There are two types of schedule, which I&apos;ll call the manager&apos;s
schedule and the maker&apos;s schedule.  The manager&apos;s schedule is for
bosses.  It&apos;s embodied in the traditional appointment book, with
each day cut into one hour intervals.  You can block off several
hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change
what you&apos;re doing every hour.<br><br>When you use time that way, it&apos;s merely a practical problem to meet
with someone.  Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, and
you&apos;re done.<br><br>Most powerful people are on the manager&apos;s schedule.  It&apos;s the
schedule of command.  But there&apos;s another way of using time that&apos;s
common among people who make things, like programmers and writers.
They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least.
You can&apos;t write or program well in units of an hour.  That&apos;s barely
enough time to get started.<br><br>When you&apos;re operating on the maker&apos;s schedule, meetings are a
disaster.  A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking
it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in.  Plus you
have to remember to go to the meeting.  That&apos;s no problem for someone
on the manager&apos;s schedule.  There&apos;s always something coming on the
next hour; the only question is what.  But when someone on the
maker&apos;s schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.<br><br>For someone on the maker&apos;s schedule, having a meeting is like
throwing an exception.  It doesn&apos;t merely cause you to switch from
one task to another; it changes the mode in which you work.<br><br>I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day.   A meeting
commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up a morning or
afternoon.  But in addition there&apos;s sometimes a cascading effect.
If I know the afternoon is going to be broken up, I&apos;m slightly less
likely to start something ambitious in the morning.  I know this
may sound oversensitive, but if you&apos;re a maker, think of your own
case.  Don&apos;t your spirits rise at the thought of having an entire
day free to work, with no appointments at all?  Well, that means
your spirits are correspondingly depressed when you don&apos;t.  And
ambitious projects are by definition close to the limits of your
capacity.  A small decrease in morale is enough to kill them off.<br><br>Each type of schedule works fine by itself.  Problems arise when
they meet.  Since most powerful people operate on the manager&apos;s
schedule, they&apos;re in a position to make everyone resonate at their
frequency if they want to.  But the smarter ones restrain themselves,
if they know that some of the people working for them need long
chunks of time to work in.<br><br>Our case is an unusual one.  Nearly all investors, including all
VCs I know, operate on the manager&apos;s schedule.  But 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>
runs on the maker&apos;s schedule.  Rtm and Trevor and I do because we
always have, and Jessica does too, mostly, because she&apos;s gotten
into sync with us.<br><br>I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if there start to be more companies like
us.  I suspect founders may increasingly be able to resist, or at
least postpone, turning into managers, just as a few decades ago
they started to be able to resist switching from jeans
to suits.<br><br>How do we manage to advise so many startups on the maker&apos;s schedule?
By using the classic device for simulating the manager&apos;s schedule
within the maker&apos;s: office hours.  Several times a week I set aside
a chunk of time to meet founders we&apos;ve funded.  These chunks of
time are at the end of my working day, and I wrote a signup program
that ensures all the appointments within a given set of office hours
are clustered at the end.  Because they come at the end of my day
these meetings are never an interruption.  (Unless their working
day ends at the same time as mine, the meeting presumably interrupts
theirs, but since they made the appointment it must be worth it to
them.)  During busy periods, office hours sometimes get long enough
that they compress the day, but they never interrupt it.<br><br>
When we were working on our own startup, back in the 90s, I evolved
another trick for partitioning the day.  I used to program from
dinner till about 3 am every day, because at night no one could
interrupt me.  Then I&apos;d sleep till about 11 am, and come in and
work until dinner on what I called &quot;business stuff.&quot;  I never thought
of it in these terms, but in effect I had two workdays each day,
one on the manager&apos;s schedule and one on the maker&apos;s.<br><br>When you&apos;re operating on the manager&apos;s schedule you can do something
you&apos;d never want to do on the maker&apos;s: you can have speculative
meetings.  You can meet someone just to get to know one another.
If you have an empty slot in your schedule, why not?  Maybe it will
turn out you can help one another in some way.<br><br>Business people in Silicon Valley (and the whole world, for that
matter) have speculative meetings all the time.  They&apos;re effectively
free if you&apos;re on the manager&apos;s schedule.  They&apos;re so common that
there&apos;s distinctive language for proposing them: saying that you
want to &quot;grab coffee,&quot; for example.<br><br>Speculative meetings are terribly costly if you&apos;re on the maker&apos;s
schedule, though.  Which puts us in something of a bind.  Everyone
assumes that, like other investors, we run on the manager&apos;s schedule.
So they introduce us to someone they think we ought to meet, or
send us an email proposing we grab coffee.  At this point we have
two options, neither of them good: we can meet with them, and lose
half a day&apos;s work; or we can try to avoid meeting them, and probably
offend them.<br><br>Till recently we weren&apos;t clear in our own minds about the source
of the problem.  We just took it for granted that we had to either
blow our schedules or offend people.  But now that I&apos;ve realized
what&apos;s going on, perhaps there&apos;s a third option: to write something
explaining the two types of schedule.  Maybe eventually, if the
conflict between the manager&apos;s schedule and the maker&apos;s schedule
starts to be more widely understood, it will become less of a
problem.<br><br>Those of us on the maker&apos;s schedule are willing to compromise.   We
know we have to have some number of meetings.  All we ask from those
on the manager&apos;s schedule is that they understand the cost.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>
July 2009<br><br>Now that the term &quot;ramen profitable&quot; has become widespread, I ought
to explain precisely what the idea entails.<br><br>Ramen profitable means a startup makes just enough to pay the
founders&apos; living expenses.  This is a different form of profitability
than startups have traditionally aimed for.  Traditional profitability
means a big bet is finally paying off, whereas the main importance
of ramen profitability is that it buys you time.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>In the past, a startup would usually become profitable only
after raising and spending quite a lot of money.  A company making
computer hardware might not become profitable for 5 years, during
which they spent $50 million.  But when they did
they might have revenues of $50 million a year.   This kind of
profitability means the startup has succeeded.<br><br>Ramen profitability is the other extreme: a startup that becomes
profitable after 2 months, even though its revenues are only $3000
a month, because the only employees are a couple 25 year old founders
who can live on practically nothing.  Revenues of $3000 a month do
not mean the company has succeeded.
But it does share something with the one
that&apos;s profitable in the traditional way: they don&apos;t need to raise
money to survive.<br><br>Ramen profitability is an unfamiliar idea to most people because
it only recently became feasible.  It&apos;s still not feasible for a
lot of startups; it would not be for most biotech startups, for
example; but it is for many software startups because they&apos;re now
so cheap.  For many, the only real cost is the founders&apos;
living expenses.<br><br>The main significance of this type of profitability is that you&apos;re
no longer at the mercy of investors.  If you&apos;re still losing money,
then eventually you&apos;ll either have to raise more
or shut down.  Once you&apos;re
ramen profitable this painful choice goes away.
You can still raise money, but you don&apos;t have to do it now.<br><br><center>* * *</center><br><br>The most obvious advantage of not needing money is that
you can get better terms.  If investors know you need money, they&apos;ll
sometimes take advantage of you.  Some may even deliberately
stall, because they know that as you run out of money you&apos;ll become
increasingly pliable.<br><br>But there are also three less obvious advantages of ramen profitability.
One is that it makes you more attractive to investors.  If you&apos;re
already profitable, on however small a scale, it shows that (a) you
can get at least someone to pay you, (b) you&apos;re serious about
building things people want, and (c) you&apos;re disciplined enough to
keep expenses low.<br><br>This is reassuring to investors, because you&apos;ve addressed three of
their biggest worries.  It&apos;s common for them to fund companies that
have smart founders and a big market, and yet still fail.  When
these companies fail, it&apos;s usually because (a) people wouldn&apos;t pay
for what they made, e.g. because it was too hard to sell to them,
or the market wasn&apos;t ready yet, (b) the founders solved the wrong
problem, instead of paying attention to what users needed, or (c)
the company spent too much and burned through their funding before
they started to make money.  If you&apos;re ramen profitable, you&apos;re
already avoiding these mistakes.<br><br>Another advantage of ramen profitability is that it&apos;s good for
morale.  A company
tends to feel rather theoretical when you first start it.  It&apos;s
legally a company, but you feel like you&apos;re lying when you call it
one.  When people start to pay you significant amounts, the company
starts to feel real.  And your own living expenses are the milestone
you feel most, because at that point the future flips state.  Now
survival is the default, instead of dying.<br><br>A morale boost on that scale is very valuable in a startup, because
the moral weight of running a startup is what makes it hard.  Startups
are still very rare.  Why don&apos;t more people do it?  The financial
risk?  Plenty of 25 year olds save nothing anyway.  The long hours?
Plenty of people work just as long hours in regular jobs. What keeps
people from starting startups is the fear of having so much
responsibility.  And this is not an irrational fear: it really is
hard to bear.  Anything that takes some of that weight off you will 
greatly increase your chances of surviving.<br><br>A startup that reaches ramen profitability may be more likely
to succeed than not.  Which is pretty exciting, considering the
bimodal distribution of outcomes in startups: you either fail or
make a lot of money.<br><br>The fourth advantage of ramen profitability is the least obvious
but may be the most important.  If you don&apos;t need to raise money,
you don&apos;t have to interrupt working on the company to do it.<br><br><a href="fundraising.html">Raising money</a> is terribly distracting.  
You&apos;re lucky if your
productivity is a third of what it was before.  And it can last for
months.<br><br>I didn&apos;t understand (or rather, remember) precisely why raising
money was so distracting till earlier this year.  I&apos;d noticed that
startups we funded would usually grind to a halt when they switched
to raising money, but I didn&apos;t remember exactly why till YC raised
money itself.  We had a comparatively easy time of it; the first
people I asked said yes; but it took months to work out the
details, and during that time I got hardly any real work done.  Why?
Because I thought about it all the time.<br><br>At any given time there tends to be one problem that&apos;s the most
urgent for a startup.  This is what you think about as you fall
asleep at night and when you take a shower in the morning.  And
when you start raising money, that becomes the problem you think
about.  You only take one shower in the morning, and if you&apos;re
thinking about investors during it, then you&apos;re not thinking about
the product.<br><br>Whereas if you can choose when you raise money, you can pick a time
when you&apos;re not in the middle of something else, and you can probably
also insist that the round close fast.  You may even be able to
avoid having the round occupy your thoughts, if you don&apos;t care
whether it closes.<br><br><center>* * *</center><br><br>Ramen profitable means no more than the definition implies.  It
does not, for example, imply that you&apos;re &quot;bootstrapping&quot; the
startup&#x2014;that you&apos;re never going to take money from investors.
Empirically that doesn&apos;t seem to work very well.  Few startups
succeed without taking investment.  Maybe as startups get cheaper
it will become more common.  On the other hand, the money is there,
waiting to be invested.  If startups need it less, they&apos;ll be able
to get it on better terms, which will make them more inclined to
take it.  That will tend to produce an equilibrium.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another thing ramen profitability doesn&apos;t imply is Joe Kraus&apos;s idea
that you should put your 
<a href="http://www.brendonwilson.com/blog/2006/04/30/joe-kraus-confessions-of-a-startup-addict/">business model</a> in beta when you put your
product in beta.  He believes you should get
people to pay you from the beginning.  I think that&apos;s too constraining.
Facebook didn&apos;t, and they&apos;ve done better than most startups.  Making
money right away was not only unnecessary for them, but probably
would have been harmful.  I do think Joe&apos;s rule could be useful for
many startups, though.  When founders seem unfocused, I sometimes
suggest they try to get customers to pay them for something, in the
hope that this constraint will prod them into action.<br><br>The difference between Joe&apos;s idea and ramen profitability is that
a ramen profitable company doesn&apos;t have to be making money the way
it ultimately will.  It just has to be making money.  The most
famous example is Google, which initially made money by licensing
search to sites like Yahoo.<br><br>Is there a downside to ramen profitability?  Probably the biggest
danger is that it might turn you into a consulting firm.  Startups
have to be product companies, in the sense of making a single thing
that everyone uses.  The defining quality of startups is that they
grow fast, and consulting just can&apos;t scale the way a product can.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
But it&apos;s pretty easy to make $3000 a month consulting; in
fact, that would be a low rate for contract programming.  So there
could be a temptation to slide into consulting, and telling
yourselves you&apos;re a ramen profitable startup, when in fact
you&apos;re not a startup at all.<br><br>It&apos;s ok to do a little consulting-type work at first.  Startups
usually have to do something weird at first.  But remember
that ramen profitability is not the destination.  A startup&apos;s
destination is to grow really big; ramen profitability is a trick
for <a href="die.html">not dying</a> en route.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
The &quot;ramen&quot; in &quot;ramen profitable&quot; refers to instant ramen,
which is just about the cheapest food available.<br><br>Please do not take the term literally.  Living on instant ramen
would be very unhealthy.  Rice and beans are a better source of
food.  Start by investing in a rice cooker, if you don&apos;t have one.<br><br>Rice and Beans for 2n
<pre>
  olive oil or butter
  n yellow onions
  other fresh vegetables; experiment
  3n cloves garlic
  n 12-oz cans white, kidney, or black beans
  n cubes Knorr beef or vegetable bouillon
  n teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
  3n teaspoons ground cumin
  n cups dry rice, preferably brown
</pre>
Put rice in rice cooker. Add water as specified on rice package.
(Default: 2 cups water per cup of rice.) Turn on rice cooker and
forget about it.<br><br>Chop onions and other vegetables and fry in oil, over fairly low
heat, till onions are glassy. Put in chopped garlic, pepper, cumin,
and a little more fat, and stir.  Keep heat low. Cook another 2 or
3 minutes, then add beans (don&apos;t drain the beans), and stir. Throw
in the bouillon cube(s), cover, and cook on lowish heat for at least
10 minutes more. Stir vigilantly to avoid sticking.<br><br>If you want to save money, buy beans in giant cans from discount
stores.  Spices are also much cheaper when bought in bulk.
If there&apos;s an Indian grocery store near you, they&apos;ll have big 
bags of cumin for the same price as the little jars in supermarkets.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There&apos;s a good chance that a shift in power from investors
to founders would actually increase the size of the venture business.
I think investors currently err too far on the side of being harsh
to founders.  If they were forced to stop, the whole venture business
would work better, and you might see something like the increase
in trade you always see when restrictive laws are removed.<br><br>Investors
are one of the biggest sources of pain for founders; if they stopped
causing so much pain, it would be better to be a founder; and if
it were better to be a founder, more people would do it.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
It&apos;s conceivable that a startup could grow big by transforming
consulting into a form that would scale.  But if they did that
they&apos;d really be a product company.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this.<br><br></p></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="segway">The Trouble with the Segway</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">July 2009<br><br>The Segway hasn&apos;t delivered on its initial promise, to put it mildly.
There are several reasons why, but one is that people don&apos;t want
to be seen riding them. Someone riding a Segway looks like a dork.<br><br>My friend Trevor Blackwell built 
<a href="http://www.tlb.org/scooter.html">his own Segway</a>, 
which we called
the Segwell. He also built a one-wheeled version, 
<a href="http://tlb.org/eunicycle.html">the Eunicycle</a>,
which looks exactly like a regular unicycle till you realize the
rider isn&apos;t pedaling.  He has ridden them both to downtown Mountain
View to get coffee.  When he rides the Eunicycle, people smile at
him.  But when he rides the Segwell, they shout abuse from their
cars: &quot;Too lazy to walk, ya fuckin homo?&quot;<br><br>Why do Segways provoke this reaction?  The reason you look like a
dork riding a Segway is that you look <i>smug</i>.  You don&apos;t seem to
be working hard enough.<br><br>Someone riding a motorcycle isn&apos;t working any harder. But because
he&apos;s sitting astride it, he seems to be making an effort.  When
you&apos;re riding a Segway you&apos;re just standing there.  And someone who&apos;s
being whisked along while seeming to do no work&#x2014;someone in a sedan
chair, for example&#x2014;can&apos;t help but look smug.<br><br>Try this thought experiment and it becomes clear: imagine something
that worked like the Segway, but that you rode with one foot in
front of the other, like a skateboard.  That wouldn&apos;t seem nearly
as uncool.<br><br>So there may be a way to capture more of the market Segway hoped
to reach: make a version that doesn&apos;t look so easy for the rider.
It would also be helpful if the styling was in the tradition of
skateboards or bicycles rather than medical devices.<br><br>Curiously enough, what got Segway into this problem was that the
company was itself a kind of Segway.  It was too easy for them;
they were too successful raising money.  If they&apos;d had to grow the
company gradually, by iterating through several versions they sold
to real users, they&apos;d have learned pretty quickly that people looked
stupid riding them. Instead they had enough to work in secret.  They
had focus groups aplenty, I&apos;m sure, but they didn&apos;t have the people
yelling insults out of cars.  So they never realized they were
zooming confidently down a blind alley.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="kate">What Kate Saw in Silicon Valley  </h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">August 2009<br><br>Kate Courteau is the architect who designed Y Combinator&apos;s office.
Recently we managed to recruit her to help us run YC when she&apos;s not
busy with architectural projects.  Though she&apos;d heard a lot about
YC since the beginning, the last 9 months have been a total immersion.<br><br>I&apos;ve been around the startup world for so long that it seems normal
to me, so I was curious to hear what had surprised her most about
it.  This was her list:<br><br><br><br><b>1. How many startups fail.</b> Kate knew in principle that startups
were very risky, but she was surprised to see how constant the
threat of failure was&#x2014;not just for the minnows, but even for the
famous startups whose founders came to speak at YC dinners.<br><br>
<b>2. How much startups&apos; ideas change.</b> As usual, by Demo Day about
half the startups were doing something significantly different than
they started with.  We encourage that.  Starting a startup is like
science in that you have to follow the truth wherever it leads.  In
the rest of the world, people don&apos;t start things till they&apos;re sure
what they want to do, and once started they tend continue on their
initial path even if it&apos;s mistaken.<br><br>
<b>3. How little money it can take to start a startup.</b> In Kate&apos;s
world, everything is still physical and expensive.  You can barely
renovate a bathroom for the cost of starting a startup.<br><br>
<b>4. How scrappy founders are.</b>  That was her actual word.  I agree
with her, but till she mentioned this it never occurred to me how
little this quality is appreciated in most of the rest of the world.
It wouldn&apos;t be a compliment in most organizations to call someone
scrappy.<br><br>What does it mean, exactly?  It&apos;s basically the diminutive form of
belligerent.  Someone who&apos;s scrappy manages to be both threatening
and undignified at the same time.   Which seems to me exactly what
one would want to be, in any kind of work.  If you&apos;re not threatening,
you&apos;re probably not doing anything new, and dignity is merely a
sort of plaque.<br><br>
<b>5. How tech-saturated Silicon Valley is.</b>  &quot;It seems like everybody
here is in the industry.&quot;  That isn&apos;t literally true, but there is
a qualitative difference between Silicon Valley and other places.
You tend to keep your voice down, because there&apos;s a good chance the
person at the next table would know some of the people you&apos;re talking
about.  I never felt that in Boston.  The good news is, there&apos;s
also a good chance the person at the next table could help you in
some way.<br><br>
<b>6. That the speakers at YC were so consistent in their advice.</b>
Actually, I&apos;ve noticed this too.  I always worry the speakers will
put us in an embarrassing position by contradicting what we tell the
startups, but it happens surprisingly rarely.<br><br>When I asked her what specific things she remembered speakers always
saying, she mentioned: that the way to succeed was to launch something
fast, listen to users, and then iterate; that startups required
resilience because they were always an emotional rollercoaster; and
that most VCs were sheep.<br><br>I&apos;ve been impressed by how consistently the speakers advocate
launching fast and iterating.  That was contrarian advice 10 years
ago, but it&apos;s clearly now the established practice.<br><br>
<b>7. How casual successful startup founders are.</b>  Most of the famous
founders in Silicon Valley are people you&apos;d overlook on the street.
It&apos;s not merely that they don&apos;t dress up.  They don&apos;t project any
kind of aura of power either.  &quot;They&apos;re not trying to impress
anyone.&quot;<br><br>Interestingly, while Kate said that she could never pick out
successful founders, she could recognize VCs, both by the way they
dressed and the way they carried themselves.<br><br>
<b>8. How important it is for founders to have people to ask for advice.</b>
(I swear I didn&apos;t prompt this one.)  Without advice &quot;they&apos;d just
be sort of lost.&quot;  Fortunately, there are a lot of people to help
them.  There&apos;s a strong tradition within YC of helping other YC-funded
startups.  But we didn&apos;t invent that idea: it&apos;s just a slightly
more concentrated form of existing Valley culture.<br><br>
<b>9. What a solitary task startups are.</b>  Architects are constantly
interacting face to face with other people, whereas doing a technology
startup, at least, tends to require long stretches of uninterrupted
time to work.  &quot;You could do it in a box.&quot;<br><br><br><br>By inverting this list, we can get a portrait of the &quot;normal&quot; world.
It&apos;s populated by people who talk a lot with one another as they
work slowly but harmoniously on conservative, expensive projects
whose destinations are decided in advance, and who carefully adjust
their manner to reflect their position in the hierarchy.<br><br>That&apos;s also a fairly accurate description of the past.  So startup
culture may not merely be different in the way you&apos;d expect any
subculture to be, but a leading indicator.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="determination">The Anatomy of Determination </h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">
<p>
September 2009<br><br>Like all investors, we spend a lot of time trying to learn how to
predict which startups will succeed.  We probably spend more time
thinking about it than most, because we invest the earliest.
Prediction is usually all we have to rely on.<br><br>We learned quickly that the most important predictor of success is
determination.  At first we thought it might be intelligence.
Everyone likes to believe that&apos;s what makes startups succeed.  It
makes a better story that a company won because its founders were
so smart.  The PR people and reporters who spread such stories
probably believe them themselves.  But while it certainly helps to
be smart, it&apos;s not the deciding factor.  There are plenty of people
as smart as Bill Gates who achieve nothing.<br><br>In most domains, talent is overrated compared to determination&#x2014;partly
because it makes a better story, partly because it gives onlookers
an excuse for being lazy, and partly because after a while determination
starts to look like talent.<br><br>I can&apos;t think of any field in which determination is overrated, but
the relative importance of determination and talent probably do
vary somewhat.  Talent probably matters more in types of work that
are purer, in the sense that one is solving mostly a single type
of problem instead of many different types.   I suspect determination
would not take you as far in math as it would in, say, organized
crime.<br><br>I don&apos;t mean to suggest by this comparison that types of work that
depend more on talent are always more admirable.  Most people would
agree it&apos;s more admirable to be good at math than memorizing long
strings of digits, even though the latter depends more on natural
ability.<br><br>Perhaps one reason people believe startup founders win by being
smarter is that intelligence does matter more in technology startups
than it used to in earlier types of companies.  You probably do
need to be a bit smarter to dominate Internet search than you had
to be to dominate railroads or hotels or newspapers.  And that&apos;s
probably an ongoing trend.  But even in the highest of high tech
industries, success still depends more on determination than brains.<br><br>If determination is so important, can we isolate its components?
Are some more important than others?  Are there some you can
cultivate?<br><br>The simplest form of determination is sheer willfulness.  When you
want something, you must have it, no matter what.<br><br>A good deal of willfulness must be inborn, because it&apos;s common to
see families where one sibling has much more of it than another.
Circumstances can alter it, but at the high end of the scale, nature
seems to be more important than nurture.  Bad circumstances can
break the spirit of a strong-willed person, but I don&apos;t think there&apos;s
much you can do to make a weak-willed person stronger-willed.<br><br>Being strong-willed is not enough, however.  You also have to be
hard on yourself.  Someone who was strong-willed but self-indulgent
would not be called determined.  Determination implies your willfulness
is balanced by discipline.<br><br>That word balance is a significant one.  The more willful you are,
the more disciplined you have to be.  The stronger your will, the
less anyone will be able to argue with you except yourself.  And
someone has to argue with you, because everyone has base impulses,
and if you have more will than discipline you&apos;ll just give into
them and end up on a local maximum like drug addiction.<br><br>We can imagine will and discipline as two fingers squeezing a
slippery melon seed.  The harder they squeeze, the further the seed
flies, but they must both squeeze equally or the seed spins off
sideways.<br><br>If this is true it has interesting implications, because discipline
can be cultivated, and in fact does tend to vary quite a lot in the
course of an individual&apos;s life.  If determination is effectively
the product of will and discipline, then you can become more
determined by being more disciplined.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another consequence of the melon seed model is that the more willful
you are, the more dangerous it is to be undisciplined.  There seem
to be plenty of examples to confirm that.  In some very energetic
people&apos;s lives you see something like wing flutter, where they
alternate between doing great work and doing absolutely nothing.
Externally this would look a lot like bipolar disorder.<br><br>The melon seed model is inaccurate in at least one respect, however:
it&apos;s static.  In fact the dangers of indiscipline increase with
temptation.  Which means, interestingly, that determination tends
to erode itself.  If you&apos;re sufficiently determined to achieve great
things, this will probably increase the number of temptations around
you.  Unless you become proportionally more disciplined, willfulness
will then get the upper hand, and your achievement will revert to
the mean.<br><br>That&apos;s why Julius Caesar thought thin men so dangerous.  They weren&apos;t
tempted by the minor perquisites of power.<br><br>The melon seed model implies it&apos;s possible to be too disciplined.
Is it?  I think there probably are people whose willfulness is
crushed down by excessive discipline, and who would achieve more
if they weren&apos;t so hard on themselves.  One reason the young sometimes
succeed where the old fail is that they don&apos;t realize how incompetent
they are.  This lets them do a kind of deficit spending.  When they
first start working on something, they overrate their achievements.
But that gives them confidence to keep working, and their performance
improves.  Whereas someone clearer-eyed would see their initial
incompetence for what it was, and perhaps be discouraged from
continuing.<br><br>There&apos;s one other major component of determination: ambition.  If
willfulness and discipline are what get you to your destination,
ambition is how you choose it.<br><br>I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s exactly right to say that ambition is a component
of determination, but they&apos;re not entirely orthogonal.  It would
seem a misnomer if someone said they were very determined to do
something trivially easy.<br><br>And fortunately ambition seems to be quite malleable; there&apos;s a lot
you can do to increase it.  Most people don&apos;t know how ambitious
to be, especially when they&apos;re young.  They don&apos;t know what&apos;s hard,
or what they&apos;re capable of.  And this problem is exacerbated by
having few peers.  Ambitious people are rare, so if everyone is
mixed together randomly, as they tend to be early in people&apos;s lives,
then the ambitious ones won&apos;t have many ambitious peers.  When you
take people like this and put them together with other ambitious
people, they bloom like dying plants given water.  Probably most
ambitious people are starved for the sort of encouragement they&apos;d
get from ambitious peers, whatever their age.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Achievements also tend to increase your ambition.  With each step
you gain confidence to stretch further next time.<br><br>So here in sum is how determination seems to work: it consists of
willfulness balanced with discipline, aimed by ambition.   And
fortunately at least two of these three qualities can be cultivated.
You may be able to increase your strength of will somewhat; you can
definitely learn self-discipline; and almost everyone is practically
malnourished when it comes to ambition.<br><br>I feel like I understand determination a bit better now.  But only
a bit: willfulness, discipline, and ambition are all concepts almost
as complicated as determination.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Note too that determination and talent are not the whole story.
There&apos;s a third factor in achievement: how much you like the work.
If you really <a href="love.html">love</a> working on something,
you don&apos;t need determination to drive you; it&apos;s what you&apos;d do anyway.
But most types of work have aspects one doesn&apos;t like, because most
types of work consist of doing things for other people, and it&apos;s
very unlikely that the tasks imposed by their needs will happen to
align exactly with what you want to do.<br><br>Indeed, if you want to create the most <a href="wealth.html">wealth</a>,
the way to do it is to focus more on their needs than your interests,
and make up the difference with determination.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Loosely speaking.  What I&apos;m claiming with the melon seed model
is more like determination is proportionate to wd^m - k|w - d|^n,
where w is will and d discipline.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Which means one of the best ways to help a society generally
is to create <a href="http://startupschool.org">events</a> and <a href="http://ycombinator.com">institutions</a> that bring ambitious
people together.  It&apos;s like pulling the control rods out of a
reactor: the energy they emit encourages other ambitious people,
instead of being absorbed by the normal people they&apos;re usually
surrounded with.<br><br>Conversely, it&apos;s probably a mistake to do as some European countries
have done and try to ensure none of your universities is significantly
better than the others.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
For example, willfulness clearly has two subcomponents,
stubbornness and energy.  The first alone yields someone who&apos;s
stubbornly inert.  The second alone yields someone flighty.
As willful people get older or otherwise lose their energy, they
tend to become merely stubborn.<br><br>

whose title begins with a number. &quot;7 Things He Won&apos;t Tell You about
Sex,&quot; or something like that.  Some popular magazines
feature articles of this type on the cover of every
issue.  That can&apos;t be happening by accident.  Editors must know
they attract readers.<br><br>Why do readers like the list of n things so much?   Mainly because
it&apos;s easier to read than a regular article.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
Structurally, the list of n things is a degenerate case of essay.
An essay can go anywhere the writer wants.  In a list of n things
the writer agrees to constrain himself to a collection of points
of roughly equal importance, and he tells the reader explicitly
what they are.<br><br>Some of the work of reading an article is understanding its
structure&#x2014;figuring out what in high school we&apos;d have called
its &quot;outline.&quot; Not explicitly, of course, but someone who really
understands an article probably has something in his brain afterward
that corresponds to such an outline.  In a list of n things, this
work is done for you.  Its structure is an exoskeleton.<br><br>As well as being explicit, the structure is guaranteed to be of the
simplest possible type: a few main points with few to no subordinate
ones, and no particular connection between them.<br><br>Because the main points are unconnected, the list of n things is
random access.  There&apos;s no thread of reasoning you have to follow.  You could
read the list in any order.  And because the points are independent
of one another, they work like watertight compartments in an
unsinkable ship.  If you get bored with, or can&apos;t understand, or
don&apos;t agree with one point, you don&apos;t have to give up on the article.
You can just abandon that one and skip to the next.  A list of n
things is parallel and therefore fault tolerant.<br><br>There are times when this format is what a writer wants.  One, obviously,
is when what you have to say actually is a list of n
things.  I once wrote an essay about the <a href="startupmistakes.html">mistakes that kill startups</a>, and a few people made fun of me
for writing something whose title began with a number.  But in that
case I really was trying to make a complete catalog of a number of
independent things.  In fact, one of the questions I was trying to
answer was how many there were.<br><br>There are other less legitimate reasons for using this format.  For
example, I use it when I get close to a deadline.  If I have to
give a talk and I haven&apos;t started it a few days beforehand, I&apos;ll
sometimes play it safe and make the talk a list of n things.<br><br>The list of n things is easier for writers as well as readers.  When
you&apos;re writing a real essay, there&apos;s always a chance you&apos;ll hit a
dead end.  A real essay is a train of thought, and some trains of
thought just peter out.  That&apos;s an alarming possibility when you
have to give a talk in a few days.  What if you run out of ideas?
The compartmentalized structure of the list of n things protects
the writer from his own stupidity in much the same way it protects
the reader.  If you run out of ideas on one point, no problem: it
won&apos;t kill the essay.  You can take out the whole point if you need
to, and the essay will still survive.<br><br>Writing a list of n things is so relaxing.  You think of n/2 of
them in the first 5 minutes.  So bang, there&apos;s the structure, and
you just have to fill it in.  As you think of more points, you just
add them to the end.  Maybe you take out or rearrange or combine a
few, but at every stage you have a valid (though initially low-res)
list of n things.  It&apos;s like the sort of programming where you write
a version 1 very quickly and then gradually modify it, but at every
point have working code&#x2014;or the style of painting where you begin
with a complete but very blurry sketch done in an hour, then spend
a week cranking up the resolution.<br><br>Because the list of n things is easier for writers too, it&apos;s not
always a damning sign when readers prefer it.  It&apos;s not necessarily
evidence readers are lazy; it could also mean they don&apos;t have
much confidence in the writer.  The list of n things is in that
respect the cheeseburger of essay forms.  If you&apos;re eating at a
restaurant you suspect is bad, your best bet is to order the
cheeseburger.  Even a bad cook can make a decent cheeseburger.  And
there are pretty strict conventions about what a cheeseburger should
look like.  You can assume the cook isn&apos;t going to try something
weird and artistic.  The list of n things similarly limits the
damage that can be done by a bad writer.  You know it&apos;s going to
be about whatever the title says, and the format prevents the writer
from indulging in any flights of fancy.<br><br>Because the list of n things is the easiest essay form, it should
be a good one for beginning writers.  And in fact it is what most
beginning writers are taught.  The classic 5 paragraph essay is
really a list of n things for n = 3.  But the students writing them
don&apos;t realize they&apos;re using the same structure as the articles they
read in <i>Cosmopolitan</i>. They&apos;re not allowed to include the numbers,
and they&apos;re expected to spackle over the gaps with gratuitous
transitions (&quot;Furthermore...&quot;) and cap the thing at either end with
introductory and concluding paragraphs so it will look superficially
like a real essay.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>It seems a fine plan to start students off with the list of n things.
It&apos;s the easiest form.  But if we&apos;re going to do that, why not do
it openly?  Let them write lists of n things like the pros, with
numbers and no transitions or &quot;conclusion.&quot;<br><br>There is one case where the list of n things is a dishonest format:
when you use it to attract attention by falsely claiming the list
is an exhaustive one.  I.e. if you write an article that purports
to be about <i>the</i> 7 secrets of success.  That kind of title is the
same sort of reflexive challenge as a whodunit. You have to at least
look at the article to check whether they&apos;re the same 7 you&apos;d list.
Are you overlooking one of the secrets of success?  Better check.<br><br>It&apos;s fine to put &quot;The&quot; before the number if you really believe
you&apos;ve made an exhaustive list.  But evidence suggests most things
with titles like this are linkbait.<br><br>The greatest weakness of the list of n things is that there&apos;s so
little room for new thought.  The main point of essay writing, when
done right, is the new ideas you have while doing it.  A real essay,
as the name implies, is 
<a href="essay.html">dynamic</a>: you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re going
to write when you start.  It will be about whatever you discover
in the course of writing it.<br><br>This can only happen in a very limited way in a list of n things.
You make the title first, and that&apos;s what it&apos;s going to be about.
You can&apos;t have more new ideas in the writing than will fit in the
watertight compartments you set up initially.  And your brain seems
to know this: because you don&apos;t have room for new ideas, you don&apos;t
have them.<br><br>Another advantage of admitting to beginning writers that the 5
paragraph essay is really a list of n things is that we can warn
them about this.  It only lets you experience the defining
characteristic of essay writing on a small scale: in thoughts of a
sentence or two.  And it&apos;s particularly dangerous that the 5 paragraph
essay buries the list of n things within something that looks like
a more sophisticated type of essay.  If you don&apos;t know you&apos;re using
this form, you don&apos;t know you need to escape it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Articles of this type are also startlingly popular on Delicious,
but I think that&apos;s because 
<a href="http://delicious.com/popular">delicious/popular</a> 
is driven by bookmarking,
not because Delicious users are stupid.  Delicious users are
collectors, and a list of n things seems particularly collectible
because it&apos;s a collection itself.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Most &quot;word problems&quot; in school math textbooks are similarly
misleading.  They look superficially like the application of math
to real problems, but they&apos;re not.  So if anything they reinforce
the impression that math is merely a complicated but pointless

consumers won&apos;t pay for content anymore.  At least, that&apos;s how they
see it.<br><br>In fact consumers never really were paying for content, and publishers
weren&apos;t really selling it either.  If the content was what they
were selling, why has the price of books or music or movies always
depended mostly on the format?  Why didn&apos;t better content cost more?
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>A copy of <i>Time</i> costs $5 for 58 pages, or 8.6 cents a page.  
<i>The Economist</i> costs $7 for 86 pages, or 8.1 cents a page.  Better
journalism is actually slightly cheaper.<br><br>Almost every form of publishing has been organized as if the medium
was what they were selling, and the content was irrelevant.  Book
publishers, for example, set prices based on the cost of producing
and distributing books.  They treat the words printed in the book
the same way a textile manufacturer treats the patterns printed on
its fabrics.<br><br>Economically, the print media are in the business of marking up
paper.  We can all imagine an old-style editor getting a scoop and
saying &quot;this will sell a lot of papers!&quot; Cross out that final S and
you&apos;re describing their business model.  The reason they make less
money now is that people don&apos;t need as much paper.<br><br>A few months ago I ran into a friend in a cafe.  I had a copy of
the <i>New York Times</i>, which I still occasionally buy on weekends.  As
I was leaving I offered it to him, as I&apos;ve done countless times
before in the same situation.  But this time something new happened.
I felt that sheepish feeling you get when you offer someone something
worthless.  &quot;Do you, er, want a printout of yesterday&apos;s news?&quot; I
asked.  (He didn&apos;t.)<br><br>Now that the medium is evaporating, publishers have nothing left
to sell.  Some seem to think they&apos;re going to sell content&#x2014;that
they were always in the content business, really.  But they weren&apos;t,
and it&apos;s unclear whether anyone could be.<br><br><b>Selling</b><br><br>There have always been people in the business of selling information,
but that has historically been a distinct business from publishing.
And the business of selling information to consumers has always
been a marginal one.  When I was a kid there were people who used
to sell newsletters containing stock tips, printed on colored paper
that made them hard for the copiers of the day to reproduce.  That
is a different world, both culturally and economically, from the
one publishers currently inhabit.<br><br>People will pay for information they think they can make money from.
That&apos;s why they paid for those stock tip newsletters, and why
companies pay now for Bloomberg terminals and Economist Intelligence
Unit reports.  But will people pay for information otherwise?
History offers little encouragement.<br><br>If audiences were willing to pay more for better content, why wasn&apos;t
anyone already selling it to them?  There was no reason you couldn&apos;t
have done that in the era of physical media.  So were the print
media and the music labels simply overlooking this opportunity?  Or
is it, rather, nonexistent?<br><br>What about iTunes?  Doesn&apos;t that show people will pay for content?
Well, not really. iTunes is more of a tollbooth than a store.  Apple
controls the default path onto the iPod.  They offer a convenient
list of songs, and whenever you choose one they ding your credit
card for a small amount, just below the threshold of attention.
Basically, iTunes makes money by taxing people, not selling them
stuff.  You can only do that if you own the channel, and even then
you don&apos;t make much from it, because a toll has to be ignorable to
work.  Once a toll becomes painful, people start to find ways around
it, and that&apos;s pretty easy with digital content.<br><br>The situation is much the same with digital books.  Whoever controls
the device sets the terms.  It&apos;s in their interest for content to
be as cheap as possible, and since they own the channel, there&apos;s a
lot they can do to drive prices down.  Prices will fall even further
once writers realize they don&apos;t need publishers.  Getting a book
printed and distributed is a daunting prospect for a writer, but
most can upload a file.<br><br>Is software a counterexample?  People pay a lot for desktop software,
and that&apos;s just information.  True, but I don&apos;t think publishers
can learn much from software.  Software companies can charge a lot
because (a) many of the customers are businesses, who get in 
<a href="http://www.bsa.org/country/News%20and%20Events/News%20Archives/en/2009/en-08312009-mueller.aspx?sc_lang=en">trouble</a>
if they use pirated versions, and (b) though in form merely
information, software is treated by both maker and purchaser as a
different type of thing from a song or an article.   A Photoshop
user needs Photoshop in a way that no one needs a particular song
or article.<br><br>That&apos;s why there&apos;s a separate word, &quot;content,&quot; for information
that&apos;s not software.  Software is a different business.  Software
and content blur together in some of the most lightweight software,
like casual games.  But those are usually free.   To make money the
way software companies do, publishers would have to become software
companies, and being publishers gives them no particular head start
in that domain. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The most promising countertrend is the premium cable channel.  People
still pay for those.  But broadcasting isn&apos;t publishing: you&apos;re not
selling a copy of something.  That&apos;s one reason the movie business
hasn&apos;t seen their revenues decline the way the news and music
businesses have.  They only have one foot in publishing.<br><br>To the extent the movie business can avoid becoming publishers,
they may avoid publishing&apos;s problems.  But there are limits to how
well they&apos;ll be able to do that.  Once publishing&#x2014;giving people
copies&#x2014;becomes the most natural way of distributing your content,
it probably doesn&apos;t work to stick to old forms of distribution just
because you make more that way.  If free copies of your content are
available online, then you&apos;re competing with publishing&apos;s form of
distribution, and that&apos;s just as bad as being a publisher.<br><br>Apparently some people in the music business hope to retroactively
convert it away from publishing, by getting listeners to pay for
subscriptions.  It seems unlikely that will work if they&apos;re just
streaming the same files you can get as mp3s.<br><br><b>Next</b><br><br>What happens to publishing if you can&apos;t sell content?  You have two
choices: give it away and make money from it indirectly, or find
ways to embody it in things people will pay for.<br><br>The first is probably the future of most current media.  
<a href="http://thesixtyone.com">Give music
away</a> and make money from concerts and t-shirts.  Publish articles
for free and make money from one of a dozen permutations of
advertising.  Both publishers and investors are down on advertising
at the moment, but it has more potential than they realize.<br><br>I&apos;m not claiming that potential will be realized by the existing
players.  The <a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs1.html">optimal</a>
ways to make money from the written word
probably require different words written by different people.<br><br>It&apos;s harder to say what will happen to movies.  They could evolve
into ads.  Or they could return to their roots and make going to
the theater a treat.  If they made the experience good enough,
audiences might start to prefer it to watching pirated movies at
home. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Or maybe the movie business will dry up, and the people
working in it will go to work for game developers.<br><br>I don&apos;t know how big embodying information in physical form will
be.  It may be surprisingly large; people overvalue 
<a href="stuff.html">physical stuff</a>.
There should remain some market for printed books, at least.<br><br>I can see the evolution of book publishing in the books on my
shelves.  Clearly at some point in the 1960s the big publishing
houses started to ask: how cheaply can we make books before people
refuse to buy them?  The answer turned out to be one step short of
phonebooks.  As long as it isn&apos;t floppy, consumers still perceive
it as a book.<br><br>That worked as long as buying printed books was the only way to
read them.  If printed books are optional, publishers will have to
work harder to entice people to buy them.  There should be some
market, but it&apos;s hard to foresee how big, because its size will
depend not on macro trends like the amount people read, but on the
ingenuity of individual publishers. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Some magazines may thrive by focusing on the magazine as a physical
object.  Fashion magazines could be made lush in a way that would
be hard to match digitally, at least for a while.  But this is
probably not an option for most magazines.<br><br>I don&apos;t know exactly what the future will look like, but I&apos;m not
too worried about it.  This sort of change tends to create as many
good things as it kills.  Indeed, the really interesting question is not
what will happen to existing forms, but what new forms will appear.<br><br>The reason I&apos;ve been writing about existing forms is that I don&apos;t
<i>know</i> what new forms will appear.  But though I can&apos;t predict
specific winners, I can offer a recipe for recognizing them.  When
you see something that&apos;s taking advantage of new technology to give
people something they want that they couldn&apos;t have before, you&apos;re
probably looking at a winner.  And when you see something that&apos;s
merely reacting to new technology in an attempt to preserve some
existing source of revenue, you&apos;re probably looking at a loser.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

I don&apos;t like the word &quot;content&quot; and tried for a while to avoid
using it, but I have to admit there&apos;s no other word that means the
right thing.  &quot;Information&quot; is too general.<br><br>Ironically, the main reason I don&apos;t like &quot;content&quot; is the thesis
of this essay.  The word suggests an undifferentiated slurry, but
economically that&apos;s how both publishers and audiences treat it.
Content is information you don&apos;t need.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Some types of publishers would be at a disadvantage trying
to enter the software business.  Record labels, for example, would
probably find it more natural to expand into casinos than software,
because the kind of people who run them would be more at home at
the mafia end of the business spectrum than the don&apos;t-be-evil end.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
I never watch movies in theaters anymore.  The tipping point
for me was the ads they show first.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Unfortunately, making physically nice books will only be a
niche within a niche.  Publishers are more likely to resort to
expedients like selling autographed copies, or editions with the
buyer&apos;s picture on the cover.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Michael Arrington, Trevor Blackwell, Steven Levy, Robert

to seem extra friendly.  You smile and say &quot;pleased to meet you,&quot;
whether you are or not.  There&apos;s nothing dishonest about this.
Everyone knows that these little social lies aren&apos;t meant
to be taken literally, just as everyone knows that 
&quot;Can you pass the salt?&quot; is only grammatically a question.<br><br>I&apos;m perfectly willing to smile and say &quot;pleased to meet you&quot;
when meeting new people.  But there is another set of 
customs for being ingratiating in print that are not so
harmless.<br><br>The reason there&apos;s a convention of being ingratiating in print
is that most essays are written to persuade.
And as any politician could tell
you, the way to persuade people is not just to baldly state the
facts.  You have to add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine
go down.<br><br>For example, a politician announcing the cancellation of 
a government program will not merely say &quot;The
program is canceled.&quot; That would seem offensively
curt.  Instead he&apos;ll spend most of his time talking about the
noble effort made by the people who worked on it.<br><br>The reason these conventions are more dangerous is that they
interact with the ideas.  Saying &quot;pleased to meet you&quot; is just
something you prepend to a conversation, but the sort of spin 
added by politicians is woven through it.  We&apos;re starting to
move from social lies to real lies.<br><br>Here&apos;s an example of a paragraph from an essay I wrote about
<a href="unions.html">labor unions</a>.  As written,
it tends to offend people who like unions.
<blockquote>
  People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic
  union organizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking
  now?  The best they can do is fall back on the default explanation
  of people living in fallen civilizations. Our ancestors were
  giants.  The workers of the early twentieth century must have had
  a moral courage that&apos;s lacking today.
</blockquote>
Now here&apos;s the same paragraph rewritten to please instead of
offending them:
<blockquote>
  Early union organizers made heroic sacrifices to improve conditions
  for workers.  But though
  labor unions are shrinking now, it&apos;s not because present union
  leaders are any less courageous.  An employer couldn&apos;t get away
  with hiring thugs to beat up union leaders today, but if they
  did, I see no reason to believe today&apos;s union leaders would shrink
  from the challenge.  So I think it would be a mistake to attribute
  the decline of unions to some kind of decline in the people who
  run them.  Early union leaders were heroic, certainly, but we
  should not suppose that if unions have declined, it&apos;s because
  present union leaders are somehow inferior.  The cause must be
  external.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
It makes the same point: that it can&apos;t have been the personal
qualities of early union organizers that made unions successful,
but must have been some external factor, or otherwise present-day
union leaders would have to be inferior people.  But written this
way it seems like a defense of present-day union organizers rather
than an attack on early ones.  That makes it more persuasive to
people who like unions, because it seems sympathetic to their cause.<br><br>I believe everything I wrote in the second version.  Early union
leaders did make heroic sacrifices.   And
present union leaders probably would rise to the occasion if
necessary.  People tend to; I&apos;m skeptical about the idea of &quot;the
greatest generation.&quot; 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>If I believe everything I said in the second version, why didn&apos;t I
write it that way?  Why offend people needlessly?<br><br>Because I&apos;d rather offend people than pander to them, 
and if you write about controversial topics you have to choose one or the other.  The degree of
courage of past or present union leaders is beside the point; all
that matters for the argument is that they&apos;re the same.
But if you want to please
people who are mistaken, you can&apos;t simply tell the truth.  You&apos;re
always going to have to add some sort of padding to protect their
misconceptions from bumping against reality.<br><br>Most writers do.  Most writers write to persuade, if only out of
habit or politeness.  But I don&apos;t write to persuade; I write to
figure out.  I write to persuade a hypothetical perfectly unbiased
reader.<br><br>Since the custom is to write to persuade the actual reader, someone
who doesn&apos;t will seem arrogant.  In fact, worse than arrogant: since
readers are used to essays that try to please someone, an essay
that displeases one side in a dispute reads as an attempt to pander
to the other.  To a lot of pro-union readers, the first paragraph
sounds like the sort of thing a right-wing radio talk show host
would say to stir up his followers.  But it&apos;s not.  Something that
curtly contradicts one&apos;s beliefs can be hard to distinguish from a
partisan attack on them, but though they can end up in the same
place they come from different sources.<br><br>Would it be so bad to add a few extra words, to make people feel
better?  Maybe not.  Maybe I&apos;m excessively attached to conciseness.
I write <a href="power.html">code</a> the same way I write essays, 
making pass after pass
looking for anything I can cut.  But I have a legitimate reason for
doing this.  You don&apos;t know what the ideas are until you get them
down to the fewest words.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The danger of the second paragraph
is not merely that it&apos;s longer.  It&apos;s that you start to lie to
yourself.  The ideas start to get mixed together with the spin
you&apos;ve added to get them past the readers&apos; misconceptions.<br><br>I think the goal of an essay should be to discover 
<a href="essay.html">surprising</a> things.  That&apos;s my goal, at least.
And most surprising means most different from what people currently
believe.  So writing to persuade and writing to discover are
diametrically opposed.  The more your conclusions disagree with
readers&apos; present beliefs, the more effort you&apos;ll have to expend on
selling your ideas rather than having them.  As you accelerate,
this drag increases, till eventually you reach a point where 100%
of your energy is devoted to overcoming it and you can&apos;t go any
faster.<br><br>It&apos;s hard enough to overcome one&apos;s own misconceptions without having
to think about how to get the resulting ideas past other people&apos;s.
I worry that if I wrote to persuade, I&apos;d start to shy away unconsciously
from ideas I knew would be hard to sell.  When I notice something
surprising, it&apos;s usually very faint at first.  There&apos;s nothing more
than a slight stirring of discomfort.  I don&apos;t want anything to get
in the way of noticing it consciously.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

I had a strange feeling of being back in high school writing
this.  To get a good grade you had to both write the sort of pious
crap you were expected to, but also seem to be writing with conviction.
The solution was a kind of method acting.  It was revoltingly
familiar to slip back into it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Exercise for the reader:
rephrase that thought to please the same people the first version
would offend.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Come to think of it, there is one way in which I deliberately
pander to readers, because it doesn&apos;t change the number of words:
I switch person.  This flattering distinction seems so natural to
the average reader that they probably don&apos;t notice even when I
switch in mid-sentence, though you tend to notice when it&apos;s done
as conspicuously as this.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston and Robert Morris

<p>
October 2009<br><br><i>(This  essay is derived from a talk at the 2009 Startup School.)</i><br><br>I wasn&apos;t sure what to talk about at Startup School, so I decided
to ask the founders of the startups we&apos;d funded.  What hadn&apos;t I
written about yet?<br><br>I&apos;m in the unusual position of being able to test the essays I write
about startups.  I hope the ones on other topics are right, but I
have no way to test them.  The ones on startups get tested by about
70 people every 6 months.<br><br>So I sent all the founders an email asking what surprised them about
starting a startup.  This amounts to asking what I got wrong, because
if I&apos;d explained things well enough, nothing should have surprised
them.<br><br>I&apos;m proud to report I got one response saying:
<blockquote>
    What surprised me the most is that everything was actually
    fairly predictable!
</blockquote>
The bad news is that I got over 100 other responses listing the
surprises they encountered.<br><br>There were very clear patterns in the responses; it was remarkable
how often several people had been surprised by exactly the same
thing.  These were the biggest:<br><br>
<b>1. Be Careful with Cofounders</b><br><br>This was the surprise mentioned by the most founders.  There were
two types of responses: that you have to be careful who you pick
as a cofounder, and that you have to work hard to maintain your
relationship.<br><br>What people wished they&apos;d paid more attention to when choosing
cofounders was character and commitment, not ability.  This was
particularly true with startups that failed.  The lesson: don&apos;t
pick cofounders who will flake.<br><br>Here&apos;s a typical reponse:
<blockquote>
    You haven&apos;t seen someone&apos;s true colors unless you&apos;ve worked
    with them on a startup.
</blockquote>
The reason character is so important is that it&apos;s tested more
severely than in most other situations.  One founder said explicitly
that the relationship between founders was more important than
ability:
<blockquote>
    I would rather cofound a startup with a friend than a stranger
    with higher output.  Startups are so hard and emotional that
    the bonds and emotional and social support that come with
    friendship outweigh the extra output lost.
</blockquote>
We learned this lesson a long time ago.  If you look at the YC
application, there are more questions about the commitment and
relationship of the founders than their ability.<br><br>Founders of successful startups talked less about choosing cofounders
and more about how hard they worked to maintain their relationship.
<blockquote>
    One thing that surprised me is how the relationship of startup
    founders goes from a friendship to a marriage.  My relationship
    with my cofounder went from just being friends to seeing each
    other all the time, fretting over the finances and cleaning up
    shit. And the startup was our baby.  I summed it up once like
    this: &quot;It&apos;s like we&apos;re married, but we&apos;re not fucking.&quot;
</blockquote>
Several people used that word &quot;married.&quot;  It&apos;s a far more intense
relationship than you usually see between coworkers&#x2014;partly because
the stresses are so much greater, and partly because at first the
founders are the whole company.  So this relationship has to be
built of top quality materials and carefully maintained.  It&apos;s the
basis of everything.<br><br>
<b>2. Startups Take Over Your Life</b><br><br>Just as the relationship between cofounders is more intense than
it usually is between coworkers, so is the relationship between the
founders and the company.  Running a startup is not like having a
job or being a student, because it never stops.  This is so foreign
to most people&apos;s experience that they don&apos;t get it till it happens.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
<blockquote>
    I didn&apos;t realize I would spend almost every waking moment either
    working or thinking about our startup.  You enter a whole
    different way of life when it&apos;s your company vs. working for
    someone else&apos;s company.
</blockquote>
It&apos;s exacerbated by the fast pace of startups, which makes it seem
like time slows down:
<blockquote>
    I think the thing that&apos;s been most surprising to me is how one&apos;s
    perspective on time shifts. Working on our startup, I remember
    time seeming to stretch out, so that a month was a huge interval.
</blockquote>
In the best case, total immersion can be exciting:
<blockquote>
    It&apos;s surprising how much you become consumed by your startup,
    in that you think about it day and night, but never once does
    it feel like &quot;work.&quot;
</blockquote>
Though I have to say, that quote is from someone we funded this
summer.  In a couple years he may not sound so chipper.<br><br>
<b>3. It&apos;s an Emotional Roller-coaster</b><br><br>This was another one lots of people were surprised about.  The ups
and downs were more extreme than they were prepared for.<br><br>In a startup, things seem great one moment and hopeless the next.
And by next, I mean a couple hours later.
<blockquote>
    The emotional ups and downs were the biggest surprise for me.
    One day, we&apos;d think of ourselves as the next Google and dream
    of buying islands; the next, we&apos;d be pondering how to let our
    loved ones know of our utter failure; and on and on.
</blockquote>
The hard part, obviously, is the lows.  For a lot of founders that
was the big surprise:
<blockquote>
    How hard it is to keep everyone motivated during rough days or
    weeks, i.e. how low the lows can be.
</blockquote>
After a while, if you don&apos;t have significant success to cheer you
up, it wears you out:
<blockquote>
    Your most basic advice to founders is &quot;just don&apos;t die,&quot; but the
    energy to keep a company going in lieu of unburdening success
    isn&apos;t free; it is siphoned from the founders themselves.
</blockquote>
There&apos;s a limit to how much you can take.  If you get to the point
where you can&apos;t keep working anymore, it&apos;s not the end of the world.
Plenty of famous founders have had some failures along the way.<br><br>
<b>4. It Can Be Fun</b><br><br>The good news is, the highs are also very high.  Several founders
said what surprised them most about doing a startup was how fun it
was:
<blockquote>
    I think you&apos;ve left out just how fun it is to do a startup. I
    am more fulfilled in my work than pretty much any of my friends
    who did not start companies.
</blockquote>
What they like most is the freedom:
<blockquote>
    I&apos;m surprised by how much better it feels to be working on
    something that is challenging and creative, something I believe
    in, as opposed to the hired-gun stuff I was doing before.  I
    knew it would feel better; what&apos;s surprising is how much better.
</blockquote>
Frankly, though, if I&apos;ve misled people here, I&apos;m not eager to fix
that.  I&apos;d rather have everyone think starting a startup is grim
and hard than have founders go into it expecting it to be fun, and
a few months later saying &quot;This is supposed to be <i>fun</i>? Are you
kidding?&quot;<br><br>The truth is, it wouldn&apos;t be fun for most people.  A lot of what
we try to do in the application process is to weed out the people
who wouldn&apos;t like it, both for our sake and theirs.<br><br>The best way to put it might be that starting a startup is fun the
way a survivalist training course would be fun, if you&apos;re into that
sort of thing.  Which is to say, not at all, if you&apos;re not.<br><br>
<b>5. Persistence Is the Key</b><br><br>A lot of founders were surprised how important persistence was in
startups. It was both a negative and a positive surprise: they were
surprised both by the degree of persistence required
<blockquote>
    Everyone said how determined and resilient you must be, but
    going through it made me realize that the determination required
    was still understated.
</blockquote>
and also by the degree to which persistence alone was able to
dissolve obstacles:
<blockquote>
    If you are persistent, even problems that seem out of your
    control (i.e. immigration) seem to work themselves out.
</blockquote>
Several founders mentioned specifically how much more important
persistence was than intelligence.
<blockquote>
    I&apos;ve been surprised again and again by just how much more
    important persistence is than raw intelligence.
</blockquote>
This applies not just to intelligence but to ability in general,
and that&apos;s why so many people said character was more important in
choosing cofounders.<br><br>
<b>6. Think Long-Term</b><br><br>You need persistence because everything takes longer than you expect.
A lot of people were surprised by that.
<blockquote>
    I&apos;m continually surprised by how long everything can take.
    Assuming your product doesn&apos;t experience the explosive growth
    that very few products do, everything from development to
    dealmaking (especially dealmaking) seems to take 2-3x longer
    than I always imagine.
</blockquote>
One reason founders are surprised is that because they work fast,
they expect everyone else to.   There&apos;s a shocking amount of shear
stress at every point where a startup touches a more bureaucratic
organization, like a big company or a VC fund.  That&apos;s why fundraising
and the enterprise market kill and maim so many startups.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>But I think the reason most founders are surprised by how long it
takes is that they&apos;re overconfident.  They think they&apos;re going to
be an instant success, like YouTube or Facebook.  You tell them
only 1 out of 100 successful startups has a trajectory like that,
and they all think &quot;we&apos;re going to be that 1.&quot;<br><br>Maybe they&apos;ll listen to one of the more successful founders:
<blockquote>
    The top thing I didn&apos;t understand before going into it is that
    persistence is the name of the game. For the vast majority of
    startups that become successful, it&apos;s going to be a <i>really</i>
    long journey, at least 3 years and probably 5+.
</blockquote>
There is a positive side to thinking longer-term.  It&apos;s not just
that you have to resign yourself to everything taking longer than
it should.  If you work patiently it&apos;s less stressful, and you can
do better work:
<blockquote>
    Because we&apos;re relaxed, it&apos;s so much easier to have fun doing
    what we do. Gone is the awkward nervous energy fueled by the
    desperate need to not fail guiding our actions. We can concentrate
    on doing what&apos;s best for our company, product, employees and
    customers.
</blockquote>
That&apos;s why things get so much better when you hit ramen profitability.
You can shift into a different mode of working.<br><br><b>7. Lots of Little Things</b><br><br>We often emphasize how rarely startups win simply because they hit
on some magic idea.  I think founders have now gotten that into
their heads.  But a lot were surprised to find this also applies
within startups.  You have to do lots of different things:
<blockquote>
    It&apos;s much more of a grind than glamorous. A timeslice selected
    at random would more likely find me tracking down a weird DLL
    loading bug on Swedish Windows, or tracking down a bug in the
    financial model Excel spreadsheet the night before a board
    meeting, rather than having brilliant flashes of strategic
    insight.
</blockquote>
Most hacker-founders would like to spend all their time programming.
You won&apos;t get to, unless you fail.  Which can be transformed into:
If you spend all your time programming, you will fail.<br><br>The principle extends even into programming.  There is rarely a
single brilliant hack that ensures success:
<blockquote>
    I learnt never to bet on any one feature or deal or anything
    to bring you success. It is never a single thing.  Everything
    is just incremental and you just have to keep doing lots of
    those things until you strike something.
</blockquote>
Even in the rare cases where a clever hack makes your fortune, you
probably won&apos;t know till later:
<blockquote>
    There is no such thing as a killer feature. Or at least you
    won&apos;t know what it is.
</blockquote>
So the best strategy is to try lots of different things.  The reason
not to put all your eggs in one basket is not the usual one,
which applies even when you know which basket is best.  In a startup
you don&apos;t even know that.<br><br>
<b>8. Start with Something Minimal</b><br><br>Lots of founders mentioned how important it was to launch with the
simplest possible thing.  By this point everyone knows you should
release fast and iterate.  It&apos;s practically a mantra at YC.  But
even so a lot of people seem to have been burned by not doing it:
<blockquote>
    Build the absolute smallest thing that can be considered a
    complete application and ship it.
</blockquote>
Why do people take too long on the first version?  Pride, mostly.
They hate to release something that could be better.  They worry
what people will say about them.  But you have to overcome this:
<blockquote>
    Doing something &quot;simple&quot; at first glance does not mean you
    aren&apos;t doing something meaningful, defensible, or valuable.
</blockquote>
Don&apos;t worry what people will say.  If your first version is so
impressive that trolls don&apos;t make fun of it, you waited too long
to launch.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>One founder said this should be your approach to all programming,
not just startups, and I tend to agree.
<blockquote>
    Now, when coding, I try to think &quot;How can I write this such
    that if people saw my code, they&apos;d be amazed at how little there
    is and how little it does?&quot;
</blockquote>
Over-engineering is poison.  It&apos;s not like doing extra work for
extra credit.  It&apos;s more like telling a lie that you then have to
remember so you don&apos;t contradict it.<br><br>
<b>9. Engage Users</b><br><br>Product development is a conversation with the user that doesn&apos;t
really start till you launch.  Before you launch, you&apos;re like a
police artist before he&apos;s shown the first version of his sketch to
the witness.<br><br>It&apos;s so important to launch fast that it may be better to think of
your initial version not as a product, but as a trick for getting
users to start talking to you.
<blockquote>
    I learned to think about the initial stages of a startup as a
    giant experiment. All products should be considered experiments,
    and those that have a market show promising results extremely
    quickly.
</blockquote>
Once you start talking to users, I guarantee you&apos;ll be surprised
by what they tell you.
<blockquote>
    When you let customers tell you what they&apos;re after, they will
    often reveal amazing details about what they find valuable as
    well what they&apos;re willing to pay for.
</blockquote>
The surprise is generally positive as well as negative. They won&apos;t
like what you&apos;ve built, but there will be other things they would
like that would be trivially easy to implement.  It&apos;s not till you
start the conversation by launching the wrong thing that they can
express (or perhaps even realize) what they&apos;re looking for.<br><br>
<b>10. Change Your Idea</b><br><br>To benefit from engaging with users you have to be willing to change
your idea.  We&apos;ve always encouraged founders to see a startup idea
as a hypothesis rather than a blueprint.  And yet they&apos;re still
surprised how well it works to change the idea.
<blockquote>
    Normally if you complain about something being hard, the general
    advice is to work harder.  With a startup, I think you should
    find a problem that&apos;s easy for you to solve.  Optimizing in
    solution-space is familiar and straightforward, but you can
    make enormous gains playing around in problem-space.
</blockquote>
Whereas mere determination, without flexibility, is a greedy algorithm
that may get you nothing more than a mediocre local maximum:
<blockquote>
    When someone is determined, there&apos;s still a danger that they&apos;ll
    follow a long, hard path that ultimately leads nowhere.
</blockquote>
You want to push forward, but at the same time twist and turn to
find the most promising path.  One founder put it very succinctly:
<blockquote>
    Fast iteration is the key to success.
</blockquote>
One reason this advice is so hard to follow is that people don&apos;t
realize how hard it is to judge startup ideas, particularly their
own.  Experienced founders learn to keep an open mind:
<blockquote>
    Now I don&apos;t laugh at ideas anymore, because I realized how
    terrible I was at knowing if they were good or not.
</blockquote>
You can never tell what will work.  You just have to do whatever
seems best at each point.  We do this with YC itself.  We still
don&apos;t know if it will work, but it seems like a decent hypothesis.<br><br>
<b>11. Don&apos;t Worry about Competitors</b><br><br>When you think you&apos;ve got a great idea, it&apos;s sort of like having a
guilty conscience about something.  All someone has to do is look
at you funny, and you think &quot;Oh my God, <i>they know.</i>&quot;<br><br>These alarms are almost always false:
<blockquote>
    Companies that seemed like competitors and threats at first
    glance usually never were when you really looked at it. Even
    if they were operating in the same area, they had a different
    goal.
</blockquote>
One reason people overreact to competitors is that they overvalue
ideas.  If ideas really were the key, a competitor with the same
idea would be a real threat.  But it&apos;s usually execution that
matters:
<blockquote>
    All the scares induced by seeing a new competitor pop up are
    forgotten weeks later. It always comes down to your own product
    and approach to the market.
</blockquote>
This is generally true even if competitors get lots of attention.
<blockquote>
    Competitors riding on lots of good blogger perception aren&apos;t
    really the winners and can disappear from the map quickly.  You
    need consumers after all.
</blockquote>
Hype doesn&apos;t make satisfied users, at least not for something as
complicated as technology.<br><br><b>12. It&apos;s Hard to Get Users</b><br><br>A lot of founders complained about how hard it was to get users,
though.
<blockquote>
    I had no idea how much time and effort needed to go into attaining
    users.
</blockquote>
This is a complicated topic.  When you can&apos;t get users, it&apos;s hard
to say whether the problem is lack of exposure, or whether the
product&apos;s simply bad.  Even good products can be blocked by switching
or integration costs:
<blockquote>
    Getting people to use a new service is incredibly difficult.
    This is especially true for a service that other companies can
    use, because it requires their developers to do work. If you&apos;re
    small, they don&apos;t think it is urgent. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
The sharpest criticism of YC came from a founder who said we didn&apos;t
focus enough on customer acquisition:
<blockquote>
    YC preaches &quot;make something people want&quot; as an engineering task,
    a never ending stream of feature after feature until enough
    people are happy and the application takes off.  There&apos;s very
    little focus on the cost of customer acquisition.
</blockquote>
This may be true; this may be something we need to fix, especially
for applications like games.  If you make something where the
challenges are mostly technical, you can rely on word of mouth,
like Google did.  One founder was surprised by how well that worked
for him:
<blockquote>
    There is an irrational fear that no one will buy your product.
    But if you work hard and incrementally make it better, there
    is no need to worry.
</blockquote>
But with other types of startups you may win less by features and
more by deals and marketing.<br><br>
<b>13. Expect the Worst with Deals</b><br><br>Deals fall through.  That&apos;s a constant of the startup world.  Startups
are powerless, and good startup ideas generally seem wrong.  So
everyone is nervous about closing deals with you, and you have no
way to make them.<br><br>This is particularly true with investors:
<blockquote>
    In retrospect, it would have been much better if we had operated
    under the assumption that we would never get any additional
    outside investment.  That would have focused us on finding
    revenue streams early.
</blockquote>
My advice is generally pessimistic.  Assume you won&apos;t get money,
and if someone does offer you any, assume you&apos;ll never get any more.
<blockquote>
    If someone offers you money, take it. You say it a lot, but I
    think it needs even more emphasizing.  We had the opportunity
    to raise a lot more money than we did last year and I wish we
    had.
</blockquote>
Why do founders ignore me?  Mostly because they&apos;re optimistic by
nature.  The mistake is to be optimistic about things you can&apos;t
control. By all means be optimistic about your ability to make
something great.  But you&apos;re asking for trouble if you&apos;re optimistic
about big companies or investors.<br><br>
<b>14. Investors Are Clueless</b><br><br>A lot of founders mentioned how surprised they were by the cluelessness
of investors:
<blockquote>
    They don&apos;t even know about the stuff they&apos;ve invested in.  I
    met some investors that had invested in a hardware device and
    when I asked them to demo the device they had difficulty switching
    it on.
</blockquote>
Angels are a bit better than VCs, because they usually have startup
experience themselves:
<blockquote>
    VC investors don&apos;t know half the time what they are talking
    about and are years behind in their thinking.  A few were great,
    but 95% of the investors we dealt with were unprofessional,
    didn&apos;t seem to be very good at business or have any kind of
    creative vision. Angels were generally much better to talk to.
</blockquote>
Why are founders surprised that VCs are clueless?  I think it&apos;s
because they seem so formidable.<br><br>The reason VCs seem formidable is that it&apos;s their profession to.
You get to be a VC by convincing asset managers to trust you with
hundreds of millions of dollars.  How do you do that?  You have to
seem confident, and you have to seem like you understand technology.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>15. You May Have to Play Games</b><br><br>Because investors are so bad at judging you, you have to work harder
than you should at selling yourself. One founder said the thing
that surprised him most was
<blockquote>
    The degree to which feigning certitude impressed investors.
</blockquote>
This is the thing that has surprised <i>me</i> most about YC founders&apos;
experiences.  This summer we invited some of the alumni to talk to
the new startups about fundraising, and pretty much 100% of their
advice was about investor psychology.  I thought I was cynical about
VCs, but the founders were much more cynical.
<blockquote>
    A lot of what startup founders do is just posturing.  It works.
</blockquote>
VCs themselves have no idea of the extent to which the startups
they like are the ones that are best at selling themselves to VCs.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font>
It&apos;s exactly the same phenomenon we saw a step earlier.  VCs get
money by seeming confident to LPs, and founders get money by seeming
confident to VCs.<br><br>
<b>16. Luck Is a Big Factor</b><br><br>With two such random linkages in the path between startups and
money, it shouldn&apos;t be surprising that luck is a big factor in
deals.  And yet a lot of founders are surprised by it.
<blockquote>
    I didn&apos;t realize how much of a role luck plays and how much is
    outside of our control.
</blockquote>
If you think about famous startups, it&apos;s pretty clear how big a
role luck plays.  Where would Microsoft be if IBM insisted on an
exclusive license for DOS?<br><br>Why are founders fooled by this?  Business guys probably aren&apos;t,
but hackers are used to a world where skill is paramount, and you
get what you deserve.
<blockquote>
    When we started our startup, I had bought the hype of the startup
    founder dream: that this is a game of skill. It is, in some
    ways.  Having skill is valuable. So is being determined as all
    hell. But being lucky is the critical ingredient.
</blockquote>
Actually the best model would be to say that the outcome is the
<i>product</i> of skill, determination, and luck.  No matter how much
skill and determination you have, if you roll a zero for luck, the
outcome is zero.<br><br>These quotes about luck are not from founders whose startups failed.
Founders who fail quickly tend to blame themselves.  Founders who
succeed quickly don&apos;t usually realize how lucky they were.  It&apos;s
the ones in the middle who see how important luck is.<br><br>
<b>17. The Value of Community</b><br><br>A surprising number of founders said what surprised them most about
starting a startup was the value of community.  Some meant the
micro-community of YC founders:
<blockquote>
    The immense value of the peer group of YC companies, and facing
    similar obstacles at similar times.
</blockquote>
which shouldn&apos;t be that surprising, because that&apos;s why it&apos;s structured
that way.  Others were surprised at the value of the startup community
in the larger sense:
<blockquote>
    How advantageous it is to live in Silicon Valley, where you
    can&apos;t help but hear all the cutting-edge tech and startup news,
    and run into useful people constantly.
</blockquote>
The specific thing that surprised them most was the general spirit
of benevolence:
<blockquote>
    One of the most surprising things I saw was the willingness of
    people to help us. Even people who had nothing to gain went out
    of their way to help our startup succeed.
</blockquote>
and particularly how it extended all the way to the top:
<blockquote>
    The surprise for me was how accessible important and interesting
    people are. It&apos;s amazing how easily you can reach out to people
    and get immediate feedback.
</blockquote>
This is one of the reasons I like being part of this world.  Creating
wealth is not a zero-sum game, so you don&apos;t have to stab people in
the back to win.<br><br>
<b>18. You Get No Respect</b><br><br>There was one surprise founders mentioned that I&apos;d forgotten about:
that outside the startup world, startup founders get no respect.
<blockquote>
    In social settings, I found that I got a lot more respect when
    I said, &quot;I worked on Microsoft Office&quot; instead of &quot;I work at a
    small startup you&apos;ve never heard of called x.&quot;
</blockquote>
Partly this is because the rest of the world just doesn&apos;t get
startups, and partly it&apos;s yet another consequence of the fact that
most good startup ideas seem bad:
<blockquote>
    If you pitch your idea to a random person, 95% of the time
    you&apos;ll find the person instinctively thinks the idea will be a
    flop and you&apos;re wasting your time (although they probably won&apos;t
    say this directly).
</blockquote>
Unfortunately this extends even to dating:
<blockquote>
    It surprised me that being a startup founder does not get you
    more admiration from women.
</blockquote>
I did know about that, but I&apos;d forgotten.<br><br>
<b>19. Things Change as You Grow</b><br><br>The last big surprise founders mentioned is how much things changed
as they grew.  The biggest change was that you got to program even
less:
<blockquote>
    Your job description as technical founder/CEO is completely
    rewritten every 6-12 months. Less coding, more
    managing/planning/company building, hiring, cleaning up messes,
    and generally getting things in place for what needs to happen
    a few months from now.
</blockquote>
In particular, you now have to deal with employees, who often have
different motivations:
<blockquote>
    I knew the founder equation and had been focused on it since I
    knew I wanted to start a startup as a 19 year old.  The employee
    equation is quite different so it took me a while to get it
    down.
</blockquote>
Fortunately, it can become a lot less stressful once you reach
cruising altitude:
<blockquote>
    I&apos;d say 75% of the stress is gone now from when we first started.
    Running a business is so much more enjoyable now.  We&apos;re more
    confident. We&apos;re more patient. We fight less. We sleep more.
</blockquote>
I wish I could say it was this way for every startup that succeeded,
but 75% is probably on the high side.<br><br>
<b>The Super-Pattern</b><br><br>There were a few other patterns, but these were the biggest.  One&apos;s
first thought when looking at them all is to ask if there&apos;s a
super-pattern, a pattern to the patterns.<br><br>I saw it immediately, and so did a YC founder I read the list to.
These are supposed to be the surprises, the things I didn&apos;t tell
people.  What do they all have in common?  They&apos;re all things I
tell people.  If I wrote a new essay with the same outline as this
that wasn&apos;t summarizing the founders&apos; responses, everyone would say
I&apos;d run out of ideas and was just repeating myself.<br><br>What is going on here?<br><br>When I look at the responses, the common theme is that
starting a startup was like I said, but way more so.  People just
don&apos;t seem to get how different it is till they do it.  Why?  The
key to that mystery is to ask, how different <i>from what?</i>  Once you
phrase it that way, the answer is obvious: from a job.  Everyone&apos;s
model of work is a job.  It&apos;s completely pervasive.  Even if you&apos;ve
never had a job, your parents probably did, along with practically
every other adult you&apos;ve met.<br><br>Unconsciously, everyone expects a startup to be like a job, and
that explains most of the surprises.  It explains why people are
surprised how carefully you have to choose cofounders and how hard
you have to work to maintain your relationship.  You don&apos;t have to
do that with coworkers.  It explains why the ups and downs are
surprisingly extreme.  In a job there is much more damping.  But
it also explains why the good times are surprisingly good: most
people can&apos;t imagine such freedom.  As you go down the list, almost
all the surprises are surprising in how much a startup differs from
a job.<br><br>You probably can&apos;t overcome anything so pervasive as the model of
work you grew up with.  So the best solution is to be consciously
aware of that.  As you go into a startup, you&apos;ll be thinking &quot;everyone
says it&apos;s really extreme.&quot;  Your next thought will probably be &quot;but
I can&apos;t believe it will be that bad.&quot;  If you want to avoid being
surprised, the next thought after that should be: &quot;and the reason
I can&apos;t believe it will be that bad is that my model of work is a
job.&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

face="verdana">
<p>
November 2009<br><br>I don&apos;t think Apple realizes how badly the App Store approval process
is broken.  Or rather, I don&apos;t think they realize how much it matters
that it&apos;s broken.<br><br>The way Apple runs the App Store has harmed their reputation with
programmers more than anything else they&apos;ve ever done. 
Their reputation with programmers used to be great.
It used to be the most common complaint you heard
about Apple was that their fans admired them too uncritically.
The App Store has changed that.  Now a lot of programmers
have started to see Apple as evil.<br><br>How much of the goodwill Apple once had with programmers have they
lost over the App Store?  A third?  Half?  And that&apos;s just so far.
The App Store is an ongoing karma leak.<br><br><center>* * *</center><br><br>How did Apple get into this mess?  Their fundamental problem is
that they don&apos;t understand software.<br><br>They treat iPhone apps the way they treat the music they sell through
iTunes.  Apple is the channel; they own the user; if you want to
reach users, you do it on their terms. The record labels agreed,
reluctantly.  But this model doesn&apos;t work for software.  It doesn&apos;t
work for an intermediary to own the user.  The software business
learned that in the early 1980s, when companies like VisiCorp showed
that although the words &quot;software&quot; and &quot;publisher&quot; fit together,
the underlying concepts don&apos;t.  Software isn&apos;t like music or books.
It&apos;s too complicated for a third party to act as an intermediary
between developer and user.   And yet that&apos;s what Apple is trying
to be with the App Store: a software publisher.  And a particularly
overreaching one at that, with fussy tastes and a rigidly enforced
house style.<br><br>If software publishing didn&apos;t work in 1980, it works even less now
that software development has evolved from a small number of big
releases to a constant stream of small ones.  But Apple doesn&apos;t
understand that either.  Their model of product development derives
from hardware.  They work on something till they think it&apos;s finished,
then they release it.  You have to do that with hardware, but because
software is so easy to change, its design can benefit from evolution.
The standard way to develop applications now is to launch fast and
iterate.  Which means it&apos;s a disaster to have long, random delays
each time you release a new version.<br><br>Apparently Apple&apos;s attitude is that developers should be more careful
when they submit a new version to the App Store.  They would say
that.  But powerful as they are, they&apos;re not powerful enough to
turn back the evolution of technology.  Programmers don&apos;t use
launch-fast-and-iterate out of laziness.  They use it because it
yields the best results.  By obstructing that process, Apple is
making them do bad work, and programmers hate that as much as Apple
would.<br><br>How would Apple like it if when they discovered a serious bug in
OS&#xA0;X, instead of releasing a software update immediately, they had
to submit their code to an intermediary who sat on it for a month
and then rejected it because it contained an icon they didn&apos;t like?<br><br>By breaking software development, Apple gets the opposite of what
they intended: the version of an app currently available in the App
Store tends to be an old and buggy one.  One developer told me:
<blockquote>
  As a result of their process, the App Store is full of half-baked
  applications. I make a new version almost every day that I release
  to beta users. The version on the App Store feels old and crappy.
  I&apos;m sure that a lot of developers feel this way: One emotion is
  &quot;I&apos;m not really proud about what&apos;s in the App Store&quot;, and it&apos;s
  combined with the emotion &quot;Really, it&apos;s Apple&apos;s fault.&quot;
</blockquote>
Another wrote:
<blockquote>
  I believe that they think their approval process helps users by
  ensuring quality.  In reality, bugs like ours get through all the
  time and then it can take 4-8 weeks to get that bug fix approved,
  leaving users to think that iPhone apps sometimes just don&apos;t work.
  Worse for Apple, these apps work just fine on other platforms
  that have immediate approval processes.
</blockquote>
Actually I suppose Apple has a third misconception: that all the
complaints about App Store approvals are not a serious problem.
They must hear developers complaining.  But partners and suppliers
are always complaining.  It would be a bad sign if they weren&apos;t;
it would mean you were being too easy on them.  Meanwhile the iPhone
is selling better than ever.  So why do they need to fix anything?<br><br>They get away with maltreating developers, in the short term, because
they make such great hardware.  I just bought a new 27&quot; iMac a
couple days ago.  It&apos;s fabulous.  The screen&apos;s too shiny, and the
disk is surprisingly loud, but it&apos;s so beautiful that you can&apos;t
make yourself care.<br><br>So I bought it, but I bought it, for the first time, with misgivings.
I felt the way I&apos;d feel buying something made in a country with a
bad human rights record.  That was new.  In the past when I bought
things from Apple it was an unalloyed pleasure.  Oh boy!  They make
such great stuff.  This time it felt like a Faustian bargain.  They
make such great stuff, but they&apos;re such assholes.  Do I really want
to support this company?<br><br><center>* * *</center><br><br>Should Apple care what people like me think?  What difference does
it make if they alienate a small minority of their users?<br><br>There are a couple reasons they should care.  One is that these
users are the people they want as employees.  If your company seems
evil, the best programmers won&apos;t work for you.  That hurt Microsoft
a lot starting in the 90s.  Programmers started to feel sheepish
about working there.  It seemed like selling out.  When people from
Microsoft were talking to other programmers and they mentioned where
they worked, there were a lot of self-deprecating jokes about having
gone over to the dark side.  But the real problem for Microsoft
wasn&apos;t the embarrassment of the people they hired.  It was the
people they never got.  And you know who got them?  Google and
Apple.  If Microsoft was the Empire, they were the Rebel Alliance.
And it&apos;s largely because they got more of the best people that
Google and Apple are doing so much better than Microsoft today.<br><br>Why are programmers so fussy about their employers&apos; morals?  Partly
because they can afford to be.  The best programmers can work
wherever they want.  They don&apos;t have to work for a company they
have qualms about.<br><br>But the other reason programmers are fussy, I think, is that evil
begets stupidity.  An organization that wins by exercising power
starts to lose the ability to win by doing better work.  And it&apos;s
not fun for a smart person to work in a place where the best ideas
aren&apos;t the ones that win.  I think the reason Google embraced &quot;Don&apos;t
be evil&quot; so eagerly was not so much to impress the outside world
as to inoculate themselves against arrogance.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>That has worked for Google so far.  They&apos;ve become more
bureaucratic, but otherwise they seem to have held true to their
original principles. With Apple that seems less the case.  When you
look at the famous 
<a href="http://www.uriahcarpenter.info/1984.html">1984 ad</a> 
now, it&apos;s easier to imagine Apple as the
dictator on the screen than the woman with the hammer.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
In fact, if you read the dictator&apos;s speech it sounds uncannily like a
prophecy of the App Store.
<blockquote>
  We have triumphed over the unprincipled dissemination of facts.<br><br>We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of
  pure ideology, where each worker may bloom secure from the pests
  of contradictory and confusing truths.
</blockquote>
The other reason Apple should care what programmers think of them
is that when you sell a platform, developers make or break you.  If
anyone should know this, Apple should.  VisiCalc made the Apple II.<br><br>And programmers build applications for the platforms they use.  Most
applications&#x2014;most startups, probably&#x2014;grow out of personal projects.
Apple itself did.  Apple made microcomputers because that&apos;s what
Steve Wozniak wanted for himself.  He couldn&apos;t have afforded a
minicomputer. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
 Microsoft likewise started out making interpreters
for little microcomputers because
Bill Gates and Paul Allen were interested in using them.  It&apos;s a
rare startup that doesn&apos;t build something the founders use.<br><br>The main reason there are so many iPhone apps is that so many programmers
have iPhones.  They may know, because they read it in an article,
that Blackberry has such and such market share.  But in practice
it&apos;s as if RIM didn&apos;t exist. If they&apos;re going to build something,
they want to be able to use it themselves, and that means building
an iPhone app.<br><br>So programmers continue to develop iPhone apps, even though Apple
continues to maltreat them.  They&apos;re like someone stuck in an abusive
relationship.  They&apos;re so attracted to the iPhone that they can&apos;t
leave.  But they&apos;re looking for a way out.  One wrote:
<blockquote>
  While I did enjoy developing for the iPhone, the control they
  place on the App Store does not give me the drive to develop
  applications as I would like. In fact I don&apos;t intend to make any
  more iPhone applications unless absolutely necessary.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
Can anything break this cycle?  No device I&apos;ve seen so far could.
Palm and RIM haven&apos;t a hope.  The only credible contender is Android.
But Android is an orphan; Google doesn&apos;t really care about it, not
the way Apple cares about the iPhone.  Apple cares about the iPhone
the way Google cares about search.<br><br><center>* * *</center><br><br>Is the future of handheld devices one locked down by Apple?  It&apos;s
a worrying prospect.  It would be a bummer to have another grim
monoculture like we had in the 1990s.  In 1995, writing software
for end users was effectively identical with writing Windows
applications.  Our horror at that prospect was the single biggest
thing that drove us to start building <a href="road.html">web apps</a>.<br><br>At least we know now what it would take to break Apple&apos;s lock.
You&apos;d have to get iPhones out of programmers&apos; hands.  If programmers
used some other device for mobile web access, they&apos;d start to develop
apps for that instead.<br><br>How could you make a device programmers liked better than the iPhone?
It&apos;s unlikely you could make something better designed.  Apple
leaves no room there.  So this alternative device probably couldn&apos;t
win on general appeal.  It would have to win by virtue of some
appeal it had to programmers specifically.<br><br>One way to appeal to programmers is with software.  If you
could think of an application programmers had to have, but that
would be impossible in the circumscribed world of the iPhone, 
you could presumably get them to switch.<br><br>That would definitely happen if programmers started to use handhelds
as development machines&#x2014;if handhelds displaced laptops the
way laptops displaced desktops.  You need more control of a development
machine than Apple will let you have over an iPhone.<br><br>Could anyone make a device that you&apos;d carry around in your pocket
like a phone, and yet would also work as a development machine?
It&apos;s hard to imagine what it would look like.  But I&apos;ve learned
never to say never about technology.  A phone-sized device that
would work as a development machine is no more miraculous by present
standards than the iPhone itself would have seemed by the standards
of 1995.<br><br>My current development machine is a MacBook Air, which I use with
an external monitor and keyboard in my office, and by itself when
traveling.  If there was a version half the size I&apos;d prefer it.
That still wouldn&apos;t be small enough to carry around everywhere like
a phone, but we&apos;re within a factor of 4 or so.  Surely that gap is
bridgeable.  In fact, let&apos;s make it an

that no one would have expected them to be, yet.<br><br>

The dictator in the 1984 ad isn&apos;t Microsoft, incidentally;
it&apos;s IBM.  IBM seemed a lot more frightening in those days, but
they were friendlier to developers than Apple is now.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
He couldn&apos;t even afford a <i>monitor</i>.  That&apos;s why the Apple
I used a TV as a monitor.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Several people I talked to mentioned how much they liked the
iPhone SDK.  The problem is not Apple&apos;s products but their policies.
Fortunately policies are software; Apple can change them instantly
if they want to.  Handy that, isn&apos;t it?<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Ross Boucher,

<p>
April 2010<br><br>The best way to come up with startup ideas is to ask yourself the
question: what do you wish someone would make for you?<br><br>There are two types of startup ideas: those that grow organically
out of your own life, and those that you decide, from afar, are
going to be necessary to some class of users other than you.  Apple
was the first type.  Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a
computer.  Unlike most people who wanted computers, he could design
one, so he did.  And since lots of other people wanted the same
thing, Apple was able to sell enough of them to get the company
rolling.  They still rely on this principle today, incidentally.
The iPhone is the phone Steve Jobs wants.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Our own startup, Viaweb, was of the second type.  We made software
for building online stores.  We didn&apos;t need this software ourselves.
We weren&apos;t direct marketers.  We didn&apos;t even know when we started
that our users were called &quot;direct marketers.&quot;  But we were
comparatively old when we started the company (I was 30 and Robert
Morris was 29), so we&apos;d seen enough to know users would need this
type of software.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>There is no sharp line between the two types of ideas, but
the most successful startups seem to be closer to the Apple type
than the Viaweb type.  When he was writing that first Basic interpreter
for the Altair, Bill Gates was writing something he would use, as
were Larry and Sergey when they wrote the first versions of Google.<br><br>Organic ideas are generally preferable to the made up kind, but
particularly so when the founders are young.  It takes experience
to predict what other people will want.  The worst ideas we see at
Y Combinator are from young founders making things they think other
people will want.<br><br>So if you want to start a startup and don&apos;t know yet what you&apos;re
going to do, I&apos;d encourage you to focus initially on organic ideas.
What&apos;s missing or broken in your daily life?  Sometimes if you just
ask that question you&apos;ll get immediate answers.  It must have seemed
obviously broken to Bill Gates that you could only program the
Altair in machine language.<br><br>You may need to stand outside yourself a bit to see brokenness,
because you tend to get used to it and take it for granted.  You
can be sure it&apos;s there, though.  There are always great ideas sitting
right under our noses.  In 2004 it was ridiculous that Harvard
undergrads were still using a Facebook printed on paper.  Surely
that sort of thing should have been online.<br><br>There are ideas that obvious lying around now.  The reason you&apos;re
overlooking them is the same reason you&apos;d have overlooked the idea
of building Facebook in 2004: organic startup ideas usually don&apos;t
seem like startup ideas at first.  We know now that Facebook was
very successful, but put yourself back in 2004.  Putting undergraduates&apos;
profiles online wouldn&apos;t have seemed like much of a startup idea.
And in fact, it wasn&apos;t initially a startup idea.  When Mark spoke
at a YC dinner this winter he said he wasn&apos;t trying to start a
company when he wrote the first version of Facebook.  It was just
a project.  So was the Apple I when Woz first started working on
it.  He didn&apos;t think he was starting a company.  If these guys had
thought they were starting companies, they might have been tempted
to do something more &quot;serious,&quot; and that would have been a mistake.<br><br>So if you want to come up with organic startup ideas, I&apos;d encourage
you to focus more on the idea part and less on the startup part.
Just fix things that seem broken, regardless of whether it seems
like the problem is important enough to build a company on.  If you
keep pursuing such threads it would be hard not to end up making
something of value to a lot of people, and when you do, surprise,
you&apos;ve got a company.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Don&apos;t be discouraged if what you produce initially is something
other people dismiss as a toy.  In fact, that&apos;s a good sign.
That&apos;s probably why everyone else has been overlooking the idea.  The first
microcomputers were dismissed as toys.  And the first planes, and
the first cars.  At this point, when someone comes to us with
something that users like but that we could envision forum trolls
dismissing as a toy, it makes us especially likely to invest.<br><br>While young founders are at a disadvantage when coming up with
made-up ideas, they&apos;re the best source of organic ones, because
they&apos;re at the forefront of technology.  They use the latest stuff.
They only just decided what to use, so why wouldn&apos;t they?  And
because they use the latest stuff, they&apos;re in a position to discover
valuable types of fixable brokenness first.<br><br>There&apos;s nothing more valuable than an unmet need that is just
becoming fixable.  If you find something broken that you can fix
for a lot of people, you&apos;ve found a gold mine.  As with an actual
gold mine, you still have to work hard to get the gold out of it.
But at least you know where the seam is, and that&apos;s the hard part.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This suggests a way to predict areas where Apple will be weak:
things Steve Jobs doesn&apos;t use.  E.g. I doubt he is much into gaming.<br><br>
[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In retrospect, we should have <i>become</i> direct marketers.  If
I were doing Viaweb again, I&apos;d open our own online store.  If we
had, we&apos;d have understood users a lot better.  I&apos;d encourage anyone
starting a startup to become one of its users, however unnatural it
seems.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Possible exception: It&apos;s hard to compete directly with open source software.
You can build things for programmers, but there has to be some part
you can charge for.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, and Jessica Livingston

spending all their money.  That&apos;s how it happens in books and movies,
because that&apos;s the colorful way to do it.  But in fact the way most
fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through
bad investments.<br><br>It&apos;s hard to spend a fortune without noticing.  Someone with ordinary
tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of
thousands of dollars without thinking &quot;wow, I&apos;m spending a lot of
money.&quot;  Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a
million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an
eye.<br><br>In most people&apos;s minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms
that making investments doesn&apos;t.  Luxuries seem self-indulgent.
And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery,
you&apos;ve already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads
to trouble.  Investing bypasses those alarms.  You&apos;re not spending
the money; you&apos;re just moving it from one asset to another.  Which
is why people trying to sell you expensive things say &quot;it&apos;s an
investment.&quot;<br><br>The solution is to develop new alarms.  This can be a tricky business,
because while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are so
basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you
from making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes
fairly counterintuitive.<br><br>A few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with
time is much the same as with money.  The most dangerous way to
lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake
work.  When you spend time having fun, you know you&apos;re being
self-indulgent.  Alarms start to go off fairly quickly.  If I woke
up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I&apos;d
feel like something was terribly wrong.  Just thinking about it
makes me wince.  I&apos;d start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on
a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.<br><br>And yet I&apos;ve definitely had days when I might as well have sat in
front of a TV all day&#x2014;days at the end of which, if I asked myself
what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically,
nothing.  I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad
as I&apos;d feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV.  If
I spent a whole day watching TV I&apos;d feel like I was descending into
perdition.  But the same alarms don&apos;t go off on the days when I get
nothing done, because I&apos;m doing stuff that seems, superficially,
like real work.  Dealing with email, for example.  You do it sitting
at a desk.  It&apos;s not fun.  So it must be work.<br><br>With time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to
protect you.  It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers,
and perhaps all pre-industrial societies.  So nature and nurture
combine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world has gotten
more complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors
that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more
virtuous types.  And the worst thing is, they&apos;re not even fun.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>
July 2010<br><br>I realized recently that what one thinks about in the shower in the
morning is more important than I&apos;d thought.  I knew it was a good
time to have ideas.  Now I&apos;d go further: now I&apos;d say it&apos;s hard to
do a really good job on anything you don&apos;t think about in the shower.<br><br>Everyone who&apos;s worked on difficult problems is probably familiar
with the phenomenon of working hard to figure something out, failing,
and then suddenly seeing the answer a bit later while doing something
else. There&apos;s a kind of thinking you do without trying to.  I&apos;m
increasingly convinced this type of thinking is not merely helpful
in solving hard problems, but necessary.  The tricky part is, you
can only control it indirectly.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>I think most people have one top idea in their mind at any given
time.  That&apos;s the idea their thoughts will drift toward when they&apos;re
allowed to drift freely.  And this idea will thus tend to get all
the benefit of that type of thinking, while others are starved of
it.  Which means it&apos;s a disaster to let the wrong idea become the
top one in your mind.<br><br>What made this clear to me was having an idea I didn&apos;t want as the
top one in my mind for two long stretches.<br><br>I&apos;d noticed startups got way less done when they started raising
money, but it was not till we ourselves raised money that I understood
why.  The problem is not the actual time it takes to meet with
investors.  The problem is that once you start raising money, raising
money becomes the top idea in your mind.  That becomes what you
think about when you take a shower in the morning.  And that means
other questions aren&apos;t.<br><br>I&apos;d hated raising money when I was running Viaweb, but I&apos;d forgotten
why I hated it so much.  When we raised money for Y Combinator, I
remembered.  Money matters are particularly likely to become the
top idea in your mind.  The reason is that they have to be.  It&apos;s
hard to get money.  It&apos;s not the sort of thing that happens by
default.  It&apos;s not going to happen unless you let it become the
thing you think about in the shower.  And then you&apos;ll make little
progress on anything else you&apos;d rather be working on.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>(I hear similar complaints from friends who are professors.  Professors
nowadays seem to have become professional fundraisers who do a
little research on the side.  It may be time to fix that.)<br><br>The reason this struck me so forcibly is that for most of the
preceding 10 years I&apos;d been able to think about what I wanted.  So
the contrast when I couldn&apos;t was sharp.  But I don&apos;t think this
problem is unique to me, because just about every startup I&apos;ve seen
grinds to a halt when they start raising money&#x2014;or talking
to acquirers.<br><br>You can&apos;t directly control where your thoughts drift.  If you&apos;re
controlling them, they&apos;re not drifting.  But you can control them
indirectly, by controlling what situations you let yourself get
into.  That has been the lesson for me: be careful what you let
become critical to you.  Try to get yourself into situations where
the most urgent problems are ones you want to think about.<br><br>You don&apos;t have complete control, of course.  An emergency could
push other thoughts out of your head.  But barring emergencies you
have a good deal of indirect control over what becomes the top idea
in your mind.<br><br>I&apos;ve found there are two types of thoughts especially worth
avoiding&#x2014;thoughts like the Nile Perch in the way they push
out more interesting ideas.  One I&apos;ve already mentioned: thoughts
about money. Getting money is almost by definition an attention
sink.
The other is disputes.  These too are engaging in the
wrong way: they have the same velcro-like shape as genuinely
interesting ideas, but without the substance.  So avoid disputes
if you want to get real work done.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Even Newton fell into this trap.  After publishing his theory of
colors in 1672 he found himself distracted by disputes for years,
finally concluding that the only solution was to stop publishing:
<blockquote>
  I see I have made myself a slave to Philosophy, but if I get free
  of Mr Linus&apos;s business I will resolutely bid adew to it eternally,
  excepting what I do for my privat satisfaction or leave to come
  out after me.  For I see a man must either resolve to put out
  nothing new or become a slave to defend it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
Linus and his students at Liege were among the more tenacious
critics.  Newton&apos;s biographer Westfall seems to feel he was
overreacting:
<blockquote>
  Recall that at the time he wrote, Newton&apos;s &quot;slavery&quot; consisted
  of five replies to Liege, totalling fourteen printed pages, over
  the course of a year.
</blockquote>
I&apos;m more sympathetic to Newton. The problem was not the 14 pages,
but the pain of having this stupid controversy constantly reintroduced
as the top idea in a mind that wanted so eagerly to think about
other things.<br><br>Turning the other cheek turns out to have selfish advantages.
Someone who does you an injury hurts you twice: first by the injury
itself, and second by taking up your time afterward thinking about
it.  If you learn to ignore injuries you can at least avoid the
second half.  I&apos;ve found I can to some extent avoid thinking about
nasty things people have done to me by telling myself: this doesn&apos;t
deserve space in my head.  I&apos;m always delighted to find I&apos;ve forgotten
the details of disputes, because that means I hadn&apos;t been thinking
about them.  My wife thinks I&apos;m more forgiving than she is, but my
motives are purely selfish.<br><br>I suspect a lot of people aren&apos;t sure what&apos;s the top idea in their
mind at any given time.  I&apos;m often mistaken about it.  I tend to
think it&apos;s the idea I&apos;d want to be the top one, rather than the one
that is.  But it&apos;s easy to figure this out: just take a shower.
What topic do your thoughts keep returning to?  If it&apos;s not what
you want to be thinking about, you may want to change something.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
No doubt there are already names for this type of thinking, but
I call it &quot;ambient thought.&quot;<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
This was made particularly clear in our case, because neither
of the funds we raised was difficult, and yet in both cases the
process dragged on for months.  Moving large amounts of money around
is never something people treat casually.  The attention required
increases with the amount&#x2014;maybe not linearly, but definitely
monotonically.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Corollary: Avoid becoming an administrator, or your job will
consist of dealing with money and disputes.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]

that they&apos;re all more concentrated forms of less addictive predecessors.
Most if not all the things we describe as addictive are.  And the
scary thing is, the process that created them is accelerating.<br><br>We wouldn&apos;t want to stop it.  It&apos;s the same process that cures
diseases: technological progress.  Technological progress means
making things do more of what we want.  When the thing we want is
something we want to want, we consider technological progress good.
If some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, that
seems strictly better.  When progress concentrates something we
don&apos;t want to want&#x2014;when it transforms opium into heroin&#x2014;it seems
bad.  But it&apos;s the same process at work.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>No one doubts this process is accelerating, which means increasing
numbers of things we like will be transformed into things we like
too much.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>As far as I know there&apos;s no word for something we like too much.
The closest is the colloquial sense of &quot;addictive.&quot; That usage has
become increasingly common during my lifetime.  And it&apos;s clear why:
there are an increasing number of things we need it for.  At the
extreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth.  Food has been
transformed by a combination of factory farming and innovations in
food processing into something with way more immediate bang for the
buck, and you can see the results in any town in America.  Checkers
and solitaire have been replaced by World of Warcraft and FarmVille.
TV has become much more engaging, and even so it <a href="convergence.html">can&apos;t compete</a> with Facebook.<br><br>The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago.   And unless
the forms of technological progress that produced these things are
subject to different laws than technological progress in general,
the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did
in the last 40.<br><br>The next 40 years will bring us some wonderful things.  I don&apos;t
mean to imply they&apos;re all to be avoided.  Alcohol is a dangerous
drug, but I&apos;d rather live in a world with wine than one without.
Most people can coexist with alcohol; but you have to be careful.
More things we like will mean more things we have to be careful
about.<br><br>Most people won&apos;t, unfortunately.  Which means that as the world
becomes more addictive, the two senses in which one can live a
normal life will be driven ever further apart.  One sense of &quot;normal&quot;
is statistically normal: what everyone else does.  The other is the
sense we mean when we talk about the normal operating range of a
piece of machinery: what works best.<br><br>These two senses are already quite far apart.  Already someone
trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of
the US.  That phenomenon is only going to become more pronounced.
You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that if
people don&apos;t think you&apos;re weird, you&apos;re living badly.<br><br>Societies eventually develop antibodies to addictive new things.
I&apos;ve seen that happen with cigarettes.  When cigarettes first
appeared, they spread the way an infectious disease spreads through
a previously isolated population.  Smoking rapidly became a
(statistically) normal thing.  There were ashtrays everywhere.  We
had ashtrays in our house when I was a kid, even though neither of
my parents smoked.  You had to for guests.<br><br>As knowledge spread about the dangers of smoking, customs changed.
In the last 20 years, smoking has been transformed from something
that seemed totally normal into a rather seedy habit: from something
movie stars did in publicity shots to something small huddles of
addicts do outside the doors of office buildings.  A lot of the
change was due to legislation, of course, but the legislation
couldn&apos;t have happened if customs hadn&apos;t already changed.<br><br>It took a while though&#x2014;on the order of 100 years.  And unless the
rate at which social antibodies evolve can increase to match the
accelerating rate at which technological progress throws off new
addictions, we&apos;ll be increasingly unable to rely on customs to
protect us.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Unless we want to be canaries in the coal mine
of each new addiction&#x2014;the people whose sad example becomes a
lesson to future generations&#x2014;we&apos;ll have to figure out for ourselves
what to avoid and how.  It will actually become a reasonable strategy
(or a more reasonable strategy) to suspect 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet">everything new</a>.<br><br>In fact, even that won&apos;t be enough.  We&apos;ll have to worry not just
about new things, but also about existing things becoming more
addictive.  That&apos;s what bit me.  I&apos;ve avoided most addictions, but
the Internet got me because it became addictive while I was using
it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Most people I know have problems with Internet addiction.  We&apos;re
all trying to figure out our own customs for getting free of it.
That&apos;s why I don&apos;t have an iPhone, for example; the last thing I
want is for the Internet to follow me out into the world.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
My latest trick is taking long hikes.  I used to think running was a
better form of exercise than hiking because it took less time.  Now
the slowness of hiking seems an advantage, because the longer I
spend on the trail, the longer I have to think without interruption.<br><br>Sounds pretty eccentric, doesn&apos;t it?  It always will when you&apos;re
trying to solve problems where there are no customs yet to guide
you.  Maybe I can&apos;t plead Occam&apos;s razor; maybe I&apos;m simply eccentric.
But if I&apos;m right about the acceleration of addictiveness, then this
kind of lonely squirming to avoid it will increasingly be the fate
of anyone who wants to get things done.  We&apos;ll increasingly be
defined by what we say no to.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Could you restrict technological progress to areas where you
wanted it?  Only in a limited way, without becoming a police state.
And even then your restrictions would have undesirable side effects.
&quot;Good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; technological progress aren&apos;t sharply differentiated,
so you&apos;d find you couldn&apos;t slow the latter without also slowing the
former.  And in any case, as Prohibition and the &quot;war on drugs&quot;
show, bans often do more harm than good.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Technology has always been accelerating.  By Paleolithic
standards, technology evolved at a blistering pace in the Neolithic
period.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Unless we mass produce social customs.  I suspect the recent
resurgence of evangelical Christianity in the US is partly a reaction
to drugs.  In desperation people reach for the sledgehammer; if
their kids won&apos;t listen to them, maybe they&apos;ll listen to God.  But
that solution has broader consequences than just getting kids to
say no to drugs.  You end up saying no to 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbXgsMxOPtI">science</a> as well.
<!-- "A rare look inside a bible belt classroom." --><br><br>I worry we may be heading for a future in which only a few people
plot their own itinerary through no-land, while everyone else books
a package tour.  Or worse still, has one booked for them by the
government.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
People commonly use the word &quot;procrastination&quot; to describe
what they do on the Internet.  It seems to me too mild to describe
what&apos;s happening as merely not-doing-work.  We don&apos;t call it
procrastination when someone gets drunk instead of working.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Several people have told me they like the iPad because it
lets them bring the Internet into situations where a laptop would
be too conspicuous.  In other words, it&apos;s a hip flask.  (This is
true of the iPhone too, of course, but this advantage isn&apos;t as
obvious because it reads as a phone, and everyone&apos;s used to those.)<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, and

<p>
August 2010<br><br>Two years ago I
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/googles.html#next">wrote</a> about what I called &quot;<xa href="http://www.paulgraham.com/googles.html#next">a huge, unexploited
opportunity in startup funding:&quot; the growing disconnect between
VCs, whose current business model requires them to invest large
amounts, and a large class of startups that need less than they
used to.  Increasingly, startups want a couple hundred thousand
dollars, not a couple million. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The opportunity is a lot less unexploited now.  Investors have
poured into this territory from both directions.  VCs are much more
likely to make angel-sized investments than they were a year ago.
And meanwhile the past year has seen a dramatic increase in a new
type of investor: the super-angel, who operates like an angel, but
using other people&apos;s money, like a VC.<br><br>Though a lot of investors are entering this territory, there is
still room for more.  The distribution of investors should mirror
the distribution of startups, which has the usual power law dropoff.
So there should be a lot more people investing tens or hundreds of
thousands than millions. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>In fact, it may be good for angels that there are more people doing
angel-sized deals, because if angel rounds become more legitimate,
then startups may start to opt for angel rounds even when they
could, if they wanted, raise series A rounds from VCs.  One reason
startups prefer series A rounds is that they&apos;re more prestigious.
But if angel investors become more active and better known, they&apos;ll
increasingly be able to compete with VCs in brand.<br><br>Of course, prestige isn&apos;t the main reason to prefer a series A
round.  A startup will probably get more attention from investors
in a series A round than an angel round.  So if a startup is choosing
between an angel round and an A round from a good VC fund, I usually
advise them to take the A round. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>But while series A rounds aren&apos;t going away, I think VCs should be
more worried about super-angels than vice versa.  Despite their
name, the super-angels are really mini VC funds, and they clearly
have existing VCs in their sights.<br><br>They would seem to have history on their side.  
The pattern here seems the same
one we see when startups and established companies enter a new
market.  Online video becomes possible, and YouTube plunges right
in, while existing media companies embrace it only half-willingly,
driven more by fear than hope, and aiming more to protect their
turf than to do great things for users.  Ditto for PayPal.  This
pattern is repeated over and over, and it&apos;s usually the invaders
who win. In this case the super-angels are the invaders.  Angel
rounds are their whole business, as online video was for YouTube.
Whereas VCs who make angel investments mostly do it as a way to
generate deal flow for series A rounds.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>On the other hand, startup investing is a very strange business.
Nearly all the returns are concentrated in a few big winners.  If
the super-angels merely fail to invest in (and to some extent
produce) the big winners, they&apos;ll be out of business, even if they
invest in all the others.<br><br><b>VCs</b><br><br>Why don&apos;t VCs start doing smaller series A rounds?  The sticking
point is board seats.  In a traditional series A round, the partner
whose deal it is takes a seat on the startup&apos;s board.  If we assume
the average startup runs for 6 years and a partner can bear to be
on 12 boards at once, then a VC fund can do 2 series A deals per
partner per year.<br><br>It has always seemed to me the solution is to take fewer board
seats.  You don&apos;t have to be on the board to help a startup.  Maybe
VCs feel they need the power that comes with board membership to
ensure their money isn&apos;t wasted.  But have they tested that theory?
Unless they&apos;ve tried not taking board seats and found their returns
are lower, they&apos;re not bracketing the problem.<br><br>I&apos;m not saying VCs don&apos;t help startups.  The good ones help them a
lot.  What I&apos;m saying is that the kind of help that matters, you
may not have to be a board member to give.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>How will this all play out?  Some VCs will probably adapt, by doing
more, smaller deals.  I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if by streamlining
their selection process and taking fewer board seats, VC funds could
do 2 to 3 times as many series A rounds with no loss of quality.<br><br>But other VCs will make no more than superficial changes.  VCs are
conservative, and the threat to them isn&apos;t mortal.  The VC funds
that don&apos;t adapt won&apos;t be violently displaced.  They&apos;ll edge gradually
into a different business without realizing it.  They&apos;ll still do
what they will call series A rounds, but these will increasingly
be de facto series B rounds.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>In such rounds they won&apos;t get the 25 to 40% of the company they do
now.  You don&apos;t give up as much of the company in later rounds
unless something is seriously wrong.  Since the VCs who don&apos;t adapt
will be investing later, their returns from winners may be smaller.
But investing later should also mean they have fewer losers.  So
their ratio of risk to return may be the same or even better.
They&apos;ll just have become a different, more conservative, type of
investment.<br><br><b>Angels</b><br><br>In the big angel rounds that increasingly compete with series A
rounds, the investors won&apos;t take as much equity as VCs do now.  And
VCs who try to compete with angels by doing more, smaller deals
will probably find they have to take less equity to do it. Which
is good news for founders: they&apos;ll get to keep more of the company.<br><br>The deal terms of angel rounds will become less restrictive
too&#x2014;not just less restrictive than series A terms, but less
restrictive than angel terms have traditionally been.<br><br>In the future, angel rounds will less often be for specific amounts
or have a lead investor.  In the old days, the standard m.o. for
startups was to find one angel to act as the lead investor.  You&apos;d
negotiate a round size and valuation with the lead, who&apos;d supply
some but not all of the money.  Then the startup and the lead would
cooperate to find the rest.<br><br>The future of angel rounds looks more like this: instead of a fixed
round size, startups will do a rolling close, where they take money
from investors one at a time till they feel they have enough.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
And though there&apos;s going to be one investor who gives them the first
check, and his or her help in recruiting other investors will
certainly be welcome, this initial investor will no longer be the
lead in the old sense of managing the round.  The startup will now
do that themselves.<br><br>There will continue to be lead investors in the sense of investors
who take the lead in <i>advising</i> a startup.  They may also make
the biggest investment.  But they won&apos;t always have to be the one
terms are negotiated with, or be the first money in, as they have
in the past.  Standardized paperwork will do away with the need to
negotiate anything except the valuation, and that will get easier
too.<br><br>If multiple investors have to share a valuation, it will be whatever
the startup can get from the first one to write a check, limited
by their guess at whether this will make later investors balk.  But
there may not have to be just one valuation.  Startups are increasingly
raising money on convertible notes, and convertible notes have not
valuations but at most valuation <i>caps</i>: caps on what the
effective valuation will be when the debt converts to equity (in a
later round, or upon acquisition if that happens first).  That&apos;s
an important difference because it means a startup could do multiple
notes at once with different caps.  This is now starting to happen,
and I predict it will become more common.<br><br><b>Sheep</b><br><br>The reason things are moving this way is that the old way sucked
for startups.  Leads could (and did) use a fixed size round as a
legitimate-seeming way of saying what all founders hate to hear:
I&apos;ll invest if other people will.  Most investors, unable to judge
startups for themselves, rely instead on the opinions of other
investors.  If everyone wants in, they want in too; if not, not.
Founders hate this because it&apos;s a recipe for deadlock, and delay
is the thing a startup can least afford.  Most investors know this
m.o. is lame, and few say openly that they&apos;re doing it.  But the
craftier ones achieve the same result by offering to lead rounds
of fixed size and supplying only part of the money.  If the startup
can&apos;t raise the rest, the lead is out too.  How could they go ahead
with the deal?  The startup would be underfunded!<br><br>In the future, investors will increasingly be unable to offer
investment subject to contingencies like other people investing.
Or rather, investors who do that will get last place in line.
Startups will go to them only to fill up rounds that are mostly
subscribed.  And since hot startups tend to have rounds that are
oversubscribed, being last in line means they&apos;ll probably miss the
hot deals.  Hot deals and successful startups are not identical,
but there is a significant correlation. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font>
So investors who won&apos;t invest unilaterally will have lower returns.<br><br>Investors will probably find they do better when deprived of this
crutch anyway.   Chasing hot deals doesn&apos;t make investors choose
better; it just makes them feel better about their choices.  I&apos;ve
seen feeding frenzies both form and fall apart many times, and as
far as I can tell they&apos;re mostly random. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font>
If investors can
no longer rely on their herd instincts, they&apos;ll have to think more
about each startup before investing.  They may be surprised how
well this works.<br><br>Deadlock wasn&apos;t the only disadvantage of letting a lead investor
manage an angel round.  The investors would not infrequently collude
to push down the valuation.  And rounds took too long to close,
because however motivated the lead was to get the round closed, he
was not a tenth as motivated as the startup.<br><br>Increasingly, startups are taking charge of their own angel rounds.
Only a few do so far, but I think we can already declare the old
way dead, because those few are the best startups.  They&apos;re the
ones in a position to tell investors how the round is going to work.
And if the startups you want to invest in do things a certain way,
what difference does it make what the others do?<br><br><b>Traction</b><br><br>In fact, it may be slightly misleading to say that angel rounds
will increasingly take the place of series A rounds.  What&apos;s really
happening is that startup-controlled rounds are taking the place
of investor-controlled rounds.<br><br>This is an instance of a very important meta-trend, one that Y
Combinator itself has been based on from the beginning: founders
are becoming increasingly powerful relative to investors.  So if
you want to predict what the future of venture funding will be like,
just ask: how would founders like it to be?  One by one, all the
things founders dislike about raising money are going to get
eliminated. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>Using that heuristic, I&apos;ll predict a couple more things.  One is
that investors will increasingly be unable to wait for startups to
have &quot;traction&quot; before they put in significant money.  It&apos;s hard
to predict in advance which startups will succeed.  So most investors
prefer, if they can, to wait till the startup is already succeeding,
then jump in quickly with an offer.  Startups hate this as well,
partly because it tends to create deadlock, and partly because it
seems kind of slimy.  If you&apos;re a promising startup but don&apos;t yet
have significant growth, all the investors are your friends in
words, but few are in actions.  They all say they love you, but
they all wait to invest. Then when you start to see growth, they
claim they were your friend all along, and are aghast at the thought
you&apos;d be so disloyal as to leave them out of your round.  If founders
become more powerful, they&apos;ll be able to make investors give them
more money upfront.<br><br>(The worst variant of this behavior is the tranched deal, where the
investor makes a small initial investment, with more to follow if
the startup does well.  In effect, this structure gives the investor
a free option on the next round, which they&apos;ll only take if it&apos;s
worse for the startup than they could get in the open market.
Tranched deals are an abuse.  They&apos;re increasingly rare, and they&apos;re
going to get rarer.) 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>Investors don&apos;t like trying to predict which startups will succeed,
but increasingly they&apos;ll have to.  Though the way that happens won&apos;t
necessarily be that the behavior of existing investors will change;
it may instead be that they&apos;ll be replaced by other investors with
different behavior&#x2014;that investors who understand startups
well enough to take on the hard problem of predicting their trajectory
will tend to displace suits whose skills lie more in raising money
from LPs.<br><br><b>Speed</b><br><br>The other thing founders hate most about fundraising is how long
it takes.  So as founders become more powerful, rounds should start
to close faster.<br><br>Fundraising is still terribly distracting for startups. If you&apos;re
a founder in the middle of raising a round, the round is the <a href="top.html">top idea in your mind</a>, which means working on the
company isn&apos;t.  If a round takes 2 months to close, which is
reasonably fast by present standards, that means 2 months during
which the company is basically treading water.  That&apos;s the worst
thing a startup could do.<br><br>So if investors want to get the best deals, the way to do it will
be to close faster.   Investors don&apos;t need weeks to make up their
minds anyway.  We decide based on about 10 minutes of reading an
application plus 10 minutes of in person interview, and we only
regret about 10% of our decisions.  If we can decide in 20 minutes,
surely the next round of investors can decide in a couple days.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>There are a lot of institutionalized delays in startup funding: the
multi-week mating dance with investors; the distinction between
termsheets and deals; the fact that each series A has enormously
elaborate, custom paperwork.  Both founders and investors tend to
take these for granted.  It&apos;s the way things have always been.  But
ultimately the reason these delays exist is that they&apos;re to the
advantage of investors.  More time gives investors more information
about a startup&apos;s trajectory, and it also tends to make startups
more pliable in negotiations, since they&apos;re usually short of money.<br><br>These conventions weren&apos;t designed to drag out the funding process,
but that&apos;s why they&apos;re allowed to persist.  Slowness is to the
advantage of investors, who have in the past been the ones with the
most power.  But there is no need for rounds to take months or even
weeks to close, and once founders realize that, it&apos;s going to stop.
Not just in angel rounds, but in series A rounds too.  The future
is simple deals with standard terms, done quickly.<br><br>One minor abuse that will get corrected in the process is option
pools.  In a traditional series A round, before the VCs invest they
make the company set aside a block of stock for future hires&#x2014;usually
between 10 and 30% of the company.  The point is to ensure this
dilution is borne by the existing shareholders.  The practice isn&apos;t
dishonest; founders know what&apos;s going on.  But it makes deals
unnecessarily complicated.  In effect the valuation is 2 numbers.
There&apos;s no need to keep doing this.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>The final thing founders want is to be able to sell some of
their own stock in later rounds.  This won&apos;t be a change, 
because the practice is now quite common.  A lot of investors
hated the idea, but the world hasn&apos;t exploded as a result,
so it will happen more, and more openly.<br><br><b>Surprise</b><br><br>I&apos;ve talked here about a bunch of changes that will be forced on
investors as founders become more powerful.  Now the good news:
investors may actually make more money as a result.<br><br>A couple days ago an interviewer 
<a href="http://techcrunch.tv/watch?id=Q3amZtMTryrpiP80cbUtsV2ah92eZP2m">asked 
me</a> if founders having more
power would be better or worse for the world.  I was surprised,
because I&apos;d never considered that question.  Better or worse, it&apos;s
happening.  But after a second&apos;s reflection, the answer seemed
obvious.  Founders understand their companies better than investors,
and it has to be better if the people with more knowledge have more
power.<br><br>One of the mistakes novice pilots make is overcontrolling the
aircraft: applying corrections too vigorously, so the aircraft
oscillates about the desired configuration instead of approaching
it asymptotically.  It seems probable that investors have till now
on average been overcontrolling their portfolio companies.  In a
lot of startups, the biggest source of stress for the founders is
not competitors but investors.  Certainly it was for us at Viaweb.
And this is not a new phenomenon: investors were James Watt&apos;s biggest
problem too.   If having less power prevents investors from
overcontrolling startups, it should be better not just for founders
but for investors too.<br><br>Investors may end up with less stock per startup, but startups will
probably do better with founders more in control, and there will
almost certainly be more of them.  Investors all compete with one
another for deals, but they aren&apos;t one another&apos;s main competitor.
Our main competitor is employers.  And so far that competitor is
crushing us.  Only a tiny fraction of people who could start a
startup do.  Nearly all customers choose the competing product, a
job.  Why?  Well, let&apos;s look at the product we&apos;re offering.  An
unbiased review would go something like this:
<blockquote>
  Starting a startup gives you more freedom and the opportunity to
  make a lot more money than a job, but it&apos;s also hard work and at
  times very stressful.
</blockquote>
Much of the stress comes from dealing with investors.  If reforming
the investment process removed that stress, we&apos;d make our product
much more attractive.  The kind of people who make good startup
founders don&apos;t mind dealing with technical problems&#x2014;they enjoy
technical problems&#x2014;but they hate the type of problems investors
cause.<br><br>Investors have no
idea that when they maltreat one startup, they&apos;re preventing 10
others from happening, but they are.  Indirectly, but they are.  So
when investors stop trying to squeeze a little more out of their
existing deals, they&apos;ll find they&apos;re net ahead, because so many
more new deals appear.<br><br>One of our axioms at Y Combinator is not to think of deal flow as
a zero-sum game.  Our main focus is to encourage more startups to happen,
not to win a larger share of the existing stream.  We&apos;ve found this
principle very useful, and we think as it spreads outward it will
help later stage investors as well.<br><br>&quot;Make something people want&quot;
applies to us too.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
In this essay I&apos;m talking mainly about software startups.
These points don&apos;t apply to types of startups that are still expensive
to start, e.g. in energy or biotech.<br><br>Even the cheap kinds of startups will generally raise large amounts
at some point, when they want to hire a lot of people.  What has
changed is how much they can get done before that.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
It&apos;s not the distribution of good startups that has a power
law dropoff, but the distribution of potentially good startups,
which is to say, good deals.  There are lots of potential winners,
from which a few actual winners emerge with hyperlinear certainty.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
As I was writing this, I asked some founders who&apos;d taken
series A rounds from top VC funds whether it was worth it, and they
unanimously said yes.<br><br>The quality of investor is more important than the type of round,
though.  I&apos;d take an angel round from good angels over a series A
from a mediocre VC.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Founders also worry that taking an angel investment from a
VC means they&apos;ll look bad if the VC declines to participate in the
next round.  The trend of VC angel investing is so new that it&apos;s
hard to say how justified this worry is.<br><br>Another danger, pointed out by Mitch Kapor, is that if VCs are only
doing angel deals to generate series A deal flow, then their
incentives aren&apos;t aligned with the founders&apos;.  The founders want
the valuation of the next round to be high, and the VCs want it to
be low.  Again, hard to say yet how much of a problem this will be.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Josh Kopelman pointed out that another way to be on fewer
boards at once is to take board seats for shorter periods.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Google was in this respect as so many others the pattern for
the future.  It would be great for VCs if the similarity extended
to returns.  That&apos;s probably too much to hope for, but the returns
may be somewhat higher, as I explain later.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Doing a rolling close doesn&apos;t mean the company is always
raising money.  That would be a distraction.  The point of a rolling
close is to make fundraising take less time, not more.  With a
classic fixed sized round, you don&apos;t get any money till all the
investors agree, and that often creates a situation where they all
sit waiting for the others to act.  A rolling close usually prevents
this.<br><br><!-- [<a name="f8n"><font color=#000000>8</font></a>]
Jeff Clavier pointed out a tax disadvantage of convertible
notes: they don't start the long term capital gains clock.  So
perhaps the ultimate solution, after investors have been conditioned
to do simpler deals with multiple caps by convertible notes, is
eventually to do equity rounds that approach the same simplicity
and flexibility.
-->
[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
There are two (non-exclusive) causes of hot deals: the quality
of the company, and domino effects among investors.  The former is
obviously a better predictor of success.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Some of the randomness is concealed by the fact that investment
is a self fulfilling prophecy.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
The shift in power to founders is exaggerated now because
it&apos;s a seller&apos;s market.  On the next downtick it will seem like I
overstated the case.  But on the next uptick after that, founders
will seem more powerful than ever.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
More generally, it will become less common for the same
investor to invest in successive rounds, except when exercising an
option to maintain their percentage.  When the same investor invests
in successive rounds, it often means the startup isn&apos;t getting
market price.  They may not care; they may prefer to work with an
investor they already know; but as the investment market becomes
more efficient, it will become increasingly easy to get market price
if they want it.  Which in turn means the investment community will
tend to become more stratified.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
The two 10 minuteses have 3 weeks between them so founders
can get cheap plane tickets, but except for that they could be
adjacent.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
I&apos;m not saying option pools themselves will go away.  They&apos;re
an administrative convenience.  What will go away is investors
requiring them.<br><br><br><br>

<p>
August 2010<br><br>When I went to work for Yahoo after they bought our startup in 1998,
it felt like the center of the world.  It was supposed to be the
next big thing.  It was supposed to be what Google turned out to
be.<br><br>What went wrong?  The problems that hosed Yahoo go back a long time,
practically to the beginning of the company.  They were already
very visible when I got there in 1998.  Yahoo had two problems
Google didn&apos;t: easy money, and ambivalence about being a technology
company.<br><br><b>Money</b><br><br>The first time I met Jerry Yang, we thought we were meeting for
different reasons.  He thought we were meeting so he could check
us out in person before buying us. I thought we were meeting so we
could show him our new technology, Revenue Loop.   It was a way of
sorting shopping search results.  Merchants bid a percentage of
sales for traffic, but the results were sorted not by the bid but
by the bid times the average amount a user would buy.  It was
like the algorithm Google uses now to sort ads, but this was in the
spring of 1998, before Google was founded.<br><br>Revenue Loop was the optimal sort for shopping search, in the sense
that it sorted in order of how much money Yahoo would make from
each link.  But it wasn&apos;t just optimal in that sense.  Ranking
search results by user behavior also makes search better.  Users
train the search: you can start out finding matches based on mere
textual similarity, and as users buy more stuff the search results
get better and better.<br><br>Jerry didn&apos;t seem to care.  I was confused.  I was showing him
technology that extracted the maximum value from search traffic,
and he didn&apos;t care?  I couldn&apos;t tell whether I was explaining it
badly, or he was just very poker faced.<br><br>I didn&apos;t realize the answer till later, after I went to work at
Yahoo.  It was neither of my guesses.  The reason Yahoo didn&apos;t care
about a technique that extracted the full value of traffic was that
advertisers were already overpaying for it.  If Yahoo merely extracted
the actual value, they&apos;d have made less.<br><br>Hard as it is to believe now, the big money then was in banner ads.
Advertisers were willing to pay ridiculous amounts for banner ads.
So Yahoo&apos;s sales force had evolved to exploit this source of revenue.
Led by a large and terrifyingly formidable man called Anil Singh,
Yahoo&apos;s sales guys would fly out to Procter &amp; Gamble and come back
with million dollar orders for banner ad impressions.<br><br>The prices seemed cheap compared to print, which was what advertisers,
for lack of any other reference, compared them to.  But they were
expensive compared to what they were worth.  So these big, dumb
companies were a dangerous source of revenue to depend on.  But
there was another source even more dangerous: other Internet startups.<br><br>By 1998, Yahoo was the beneficiary of a de facto Ponzi scheme.
Investors were excited about the Internet.  One reason they were
excited was Yahoo&apos;s revenue growth.  So they invested in new Internet
startups.  The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to
get traffic.  Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and
further convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in.
When I realized this one day, sitting in my cubicle, I jumped up
like Archimedes in his bathtub, except instead of &quot;Eureka!&quot; I was
shouting &quot;Sell!&quot;<br><br>Both the Internet startups and the Procter &amp; Gambles were doing
brand advertising.  They didn&apos;t care about targeting.  They just
wanted lots of people to see their ads.  So traffic became the thing
to get at Yahoo.  It didn&apos;t matter what type.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>It wasn&apos;t just Yahoo.  All the search engines were doing it.  This
was why they were trying to get people to start calling them &quot;portals&quot;
instead of &quot;search engines.&quot; Despite the actual meaning of the word
portal, what they meant by it was a site where users would find
what they wanted on the site itself, instead of just passing through
on their way to other destinations, as they did at a search engine.<br><br>I remember telling David Filo in late 1998 or early 1999 that Yahoo
should buy Google, because I and most of the other programmers in
the company were using it instead of Yahoo for search.  He told me
that it wasn&apos;t worth worrying about.  Search was only 6% of our
traffic, and we were growing at 10% a month.   It wasn&apos;t worth doing
better.<br><br>I didn&apos;t say &quot;But search traffic is worth more than other traffic!&quot;
I said &quot;Oh, ok.&quot;  Because I didn&apos;t realize either how much search
traffic was worth.  I&apos;m not sure even Larry and Sergey did then.
If they had, Google presumably wouldn&apos;t have expended any effort
on enterprise search.<br><br>If circumstances had been different, the people running Yahoo might
have realized sooner how important search was.  But they had the
most opaque obstacle in the world between them and the truth: money.
As long as customers were writing big checks for banner ads, it was
hard to take search seriously.  Google didn&apos;t have that to distract
them.<br><br><b>Hackers</b><br><br>But Yahoo also had another problem that made it hard to change
directions.  They&apos;d been thrown off balance from the start by their
ambivalence about being a technology company.<br><br>One of the weirdest things about Yahoo when I went to work there
was the way they insisted on calling themselves a &quot;media company.&quot;
If you walked around their offices, it seemed like a software
company.  The cubicles were full of programmers writing code, product
managers thinking about feature lists and ship dates, support people
(yes, there were actually support people) telling users to restart
their browsers, and so on, just like a software company.  So why
did they call themselves a media company?<br><br>One reason was the way they made money: by selling ads.  In 1995
it was hard to imagine a technology company making money that way.
Technology companies made money by selling their software to users.
Media companies sold ads.  So they must be a media company.<br><br>Another big factor was the fear of Microsoft.   If anyone at Yahoo
considered the idea that they should be a technology company, the
next thought would have been that Microsoft would crush them.<br><br>It&apos;s hard for anyone much younger than me to understand the fear
Microsoft still inspired in 1995.  Imagine a company with several
times the power Google has now, but way meaner.  It was perfectly
reasonable to be afraid of them.  Yahoo watched them crush the first
hot Internet company, Netscape.  It was reasonable to worry that
if they tried to be the next Netscape, they&apos;d suffer the same fate.
How were they to know that Netscape would turn out to be Microsoft&apos;s
last victim?<br><br>It would have been a clever move to pretend to be a media company
to throw Microsoft off their scent.  But unfortunately Yahoo actually
tried to be one, sort of.  Project managers at Yahoo were called
&quot;producers,&quot; for example, and the different parts of the company
were called &quot;properties.&quot; But what Yahoo really needed to be was a
technology company, and by trying to be something else, they ended
up being something that was neither here nor there.  That&apos;s why
Yahoo as a company has never had a sharply defined identity.<br><br>The worst consequence of trying to be a media company was that they
didn&apos;t take programming seriously enough.  Microsoft (back in the
day), Google, and Facebook have all had hacker-centric cultures.
But Yahoo treated programming as a commodity.  At Yahoo, user-facing software
was controlled by product managers and designers.  The job of
programmers was just to take the work of the product managers and
designers the final step, by translating it into code.<br><br>One obvious result of this practice was that when Yahoo built things,
they often weren&apos;t very good. But that wasn&apos;t the worst problem.
The worst problem was that they hired bad programmers.<br><br>Microsoft (back in the day), Google, and Facebook have all been
obsessed with hiring the best programmers.  Yahoo wasn&apos;t.  They
preferred good programmers to bad ones, but they didn&apos;t have the
kind of single-minded, almost obnoxiously elitist focus on hiring
the smartest people that the big winners have had.  And when you
consider how much competition there was for programmers when they
were hiring, during the Bubble, it&apos;s not surprising that the quality
of their programmers was uneven.<br><br>In technology, once you have bad programmers, you&apos;re doomed.  I
can&apos;t think of an instance where a company has sunk into technical
mediocrity and recovered. Good programmers want to work with other
good programmers.  So once the quality of programmers at your company
starts to drop, you enter a death spiral from which there is no
recovery.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>At Yahoo this death spiral started early.  If there was ever a time when
Yahoo was a Google-style talent magnet, it was over by the time I
got there in 1998.<br><br>The company felt prematurely old.  Most technology companies
eventually get taken over by suits and middle managers.  At Yahoo
it felt as if they&apos;d deliberately accelerated this process.  They
didn&apos;t want to be a bunch of hackers.  They wanted to be suits.  A
media company should be run by suits.<br><br>The first time I visited Google, they had about 500 people, the
same number Yahoo had when I went to work there.  But boy did things
seem different.  It was still very much a hacker-centric culture.
I remember talking to some programmers in the cafeteria about the
problem of gaming search results (now known as SEO), and they asked
&quot;what should we do?&quot;  Programmers at Yahoo wouldn&apos;t have asked that.
Theirs was not to reason why; theirs was to build what product
managers spec&apos;d.  I remember coming away from Google thinking &quot;Wow,
it&apos;s still a startup.&quot;<br><br>There&apos;s not much we can learn from Yahoo&apos;s first fatal flaw. It&apos;s
probably too much to hope any company could avoid being damaged by
depending on a bogus source of revenue.  But startups can learn an
important lesson from the second one.  In the software business,
you can&apos;t afford not to have a hacker-centric culture.<br><br>Probably the most impressive commitment I&apos;ve heard to having a
hacker-centric culture came from Mark Zuckerberg, when he spoke at
Startup School in 2007.  He said that in the early days Facebook
made a point of hiring programmers even for jobs that would not
ordinarily consist of programming, like HR and marketing.<br><br>So which companies need to have a hacker-centric culture?  Which
companies are &quot;in the software business&quot; in this respect?  As Yahoo
discovered, the area covered by this rule is bigger than most people
realize.  The answer is: any company that needs to have good software.<br><br>Why would great programmers want to work for a company that didn&apos;t
have a hacker-centric culture, as long as there were others that
did?  I can imagine two reasons: if they were paid a huge amount,
or if the domain was interesting and none of the companies in it
were hacker-centric.  Otherwise you can&apos;t attract good programmers
to work in a suit-centric culture.  And without good programmers
you won&apos;t get good software, no matter how many people you put on
a task, or how many procedures you establish to ensure &quot;quality.&quot;<br><br><a href="gba.html">Hacker culture</a> 
often seems kind of irresponsible.  That&apos;s why people
proposing to destroy it use phrases like &quot;adult supervision.&quot; That
was the phrase they used at Yahoo.  But there are worse things than
seeming irresponsible.  Losing, for example.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

In theory you could beat the death spiral by buying good
programmers instead of hiring them.  You can get programmers
who would never have come to you as employees by buying their 
startups. But so far the only companies smart enough
to do this are companies smart enough not to need to.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and

September 2010<br><br>The reason startups have been using 
<a href="http://twitter.com/paulg/status/22319113993">more convertible notes</a> in angel
rounds is that they make deals close faster.  By making it easier
for startups to give different prices to different investors, they
help them break the sort of deadlock that happens when investors
all wait to see who else is going to invest.<br><br>By far the biggest influence on investors&apos; opinions of a startup
is the opinion of other investors.  There are very, very few who
simply decide for themselves.  Any startup founder can tell you the
most common question they hear from investors is not about the
founders or the product, but &quot;who else is investing?&quot;<br><br>That tends to produce deadlocks.  Raising an old-fashioned 
fixed-size equity round can take weeks, because all the angels sit around
waiting for the others to commit, like competitors in a bicycle
sprint who deliberately ride slowly at the start so they can follow
whoever breaks first.<br><br>Convertible notes let startups beat such deadlocks by rewarding
investors willing to move first with lower (effective) valuations.
Which they deserve because they&apos;re taking more risk.  It&apos;s much
safer to invest in a startup Ron Conway has already invested in;
someone who comes after him should pay a higher price.<br><br>The reason convertible notes allow more flexibility in price is
that valuation caps aren&apos;t actual valuations, and notes are cheap
and easy to do.  So you can do high-resolution fundraising: if you
wanted you could have a separate note with a different cap for each
investor.<br><br>That cap need not simply rise monotonically.  A startup could 
also give better deals to investors they expected to help
them most.  The point is simply that different investors, 
whether because of the help they offer or their willingness to
commit, have different values for
startups, and their terms should reflect that.<br><br>Different terms for different investors is
clearly the way of the future.  Markets always evolve toward higher
resolution.  You may not need to use convertible notes to do it.
With sufficiently lightweight standardized equity terms (and some
changes in investors&apos; and lawyers&apos; expectations about equity rounds)
you might be able to do the same thing with equity instead of debt.
Either would be fine with startups, so long as they can easily
change their valuation.<br><br>Deadlocks weren&apos;t the only problem with fixed-size equity rounds.
Another was that startups had to decide in advance how much to
raise.  I think it&apos;s a mistake for a startup to fix upon a specific
number. If investors are easily convinced, the startup should raise more
now, and if investors are skeptical, the startup should take a
smaller amount and use that to get the company to the point where
it&apos;s more convincing.<br><br>It&apos;s just not reasonable to expect startups to pick an optimal round
size in advance, because that depends on the reactions of investors,
and those are impossible to predict.<br><br>Fixed-size, multi-investor angel rounds are such a bad idea for
startups that one wonders why things were ever done that way.  One
possibility is that this custom reflects the way investors like to
collude when they can get away with it.  But I think the actual
explanation is less sinister.  I think angels (and their lawyers)
organized rounds this way in unthinking imitation of VC series A
rounds.  In a series A, a fixed-size equity round with a lead makes
sense, because there is usually just one big investor, who is
unequivocally the lead.  Fixed-size series A rounds already are
high res.  But the more investors you have in a round, the less
sense it makes for everyone to get the same price.<br><br>The most interesting question here may be what high res fundraising
will do to the world of investors.  Bolder investors will now get
rewarded with lower prices.  But more important, in a
hits-driven business, is that they&apos;ll be able to get into the deals
they want.  Whereas the &quot;who else is investing?&quot; type of investors
will not only pay higher prices, but may not be able to get into
the best deals at all.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Immad Akhund, Sam Altman, John Bautista, Pete Koomen,

<p>
October 2010<br><br>Silicon Valley proper is mostly suburban sprawl.  At first glance
it doesn&apos;t seem there&apos;s anything to see.  It&apos;s not the sort of place
that has conspicuous monuments.  But if you look, there are subtle
signs you&apos;re in a place that&apos;s different from other places.<br><br><b>1. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=stanford+university">Stanford
University</a></b><br><br>Stanford is a strange place.  Structurally it is to an ordinary
university what suburbia is to a city.  It&apos;s enormously spread out,
and feels surprisingly empty much of the time.  But notice the
weather.  It&apos;s probably perfect.  And notice the beautiful mountains
to the west.  And though you can&apos;t see it, cosmopolitan San Francisco
is 40 minutes to the north.  That combination is much of the reason
Silicon Valley grew up around this university and not some other
one.<br><br><b>2. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=university+and+ramona+palo+alto">University
Ave</a></b><br><br>A surprising amount of the work of the Valley is done in the cafes
on or just off University Ave in Palo Alto.  If you visit on a
weekday between 10 and 5, you&apos;ll often see founders pitching
investors.  In case you can&apos;t tell, the founders are the ones leaning
forward eagerly, and the investors are the ones sitting back with
slightly pained expressions.<br><br><b>3.  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=165+university+ave+palo+alto">The Lucky
Office</a></b><br><br>The office at 165 University Ave was Google&apos;s first.  Then it was
Paypal&apos;s.  (Now it&apos;s <a href="http://wepay.com">Wepay</a>&apos;s.)  The interesting thing about it is
the location.  It&apos;s a smart move to put a startup in a place with
restaurants and people walking around instead of in an office park,
because then the people who work there want to stay there, instead
of fleeing as soon as conventional working hours end.  They go out
for dinner together, talk about ideas, and then come back and
implement them.<br><br>It&apos;s important to realize that Google&apos;s current location in an
office park is not where they started; it&apos;s just where they were
forced to move when they needed more space.  Facebook was till
recently across the street, till they too had to move because they
needed more space.<br><br><b>4. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=old+palo+alto">Old
Palo Alto</a></b><br><br>Palo Alto was not originally a suburb.  For the first 100 years or
so of its existence, it was a college town out in the countryside.
Then in the mid 1950s it was engulfed in a wave of suburbia that
raced down the peninsula.  But Palo Alto north of Oregon expressway
still feels noticeably different from the area around it.  It&apos;s one
of the nicest places in the Valley.  The buildings are old (though
increasingly they are being torn down and replaced with generic
McMansions) and the trees are tall.  But houses are very
expensive&#x2014;around $1000 per square foot. This is post-exit
Silicon Valley.<br><br>
<b>5. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2900+sand+hill+road+menlo+park">Sand
Hill Road</a></b><br><br>It&apos;s interesting to see the VCs&apos; offices on the north side of Sand
Hill Road precisely because they&apos;re so boringly uniform.  The
buildings are all more or less the same, their exteriors express
very little, and they are arranged in a confusing maze.  (I&apos;ve been
visiting them for years and I still occasionally get lost.) It&apos;s
not a coincidence.  These buildings are a pretty accurate reflection
of the VC business.<br><br>If you go on a weekday you may see groups of founders there to meet
VCs. But mostly you won&apos;t see anyone; bustling is the last word
you&apos;d use to describe the atmos.  Visiting Sand Hill Road reminds
you that the opposite of &quot;down and dirty&quot; would be &quot;up and clean.&quot;<br><br><b>6.  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=castro+and+villa+mountain+view">Castro
Street</a></b><br><br>It&apos;s a tossup whether Castro Street or University Ave should be
considered the heart of the Valley now.  University Ave would have
been 10 years ago.  But Palo Alto is getting expensive.  Increasingly
startups are located in Mountain View, and Palo Alto is a place
they come to meet investors.  Palo Alto has a lot of different
cafes, but there is one that clearly dominates in Mountain View:
<a href="http://maps.google.com/places/us/ca/mountain-view/castro-st/201/-red-rock-coffee">Red
Rock</a>.<br><br><b>7. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=charleston+road+mountain+view">Google</a></b><br><br>Google spread out from its first building in Mountain View 
to a lot of the surrounding ones.  But because the
buildings were built at different times by different people,
the place doesn&apos;t have the sterile, walled-off feel that a typical
large company&apos;s headquarters have.  It definitely has a flavor of
its own though.  You sense there is something afoot.  The general
atmos is vaguely utopian; there are lots of Priuses, and people who
look like they drive them.<br><br>You can&apos;t get into Google unless you know someone there.  It&apos;s very
much worth seeing inside if you can, though.   Ditto for Facebook,
at the end of California Ave in Palo Alto, though there is nothing
to see outside.<br><br><b>8.  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=skylonda">Skyline
Drive</a></b><br><br>Skyline Drive runs along the crest of the Santa Cruz mountains.  On
one side is the Valley, and on the other is the sea&#x2014;which
because it&apos;s cold and foggy and has few harbors, plays surprisingly
little role in the lives of people in the Valley, considering how
close it is.  Along some parts of Skyline the dominant trees are
huge redwoods, and in others they&apos;re live oaks.  Redwoods mean those
are the parts where the fog off the coast comes in at night; redwoods
condense rain out of fog.  The MROSD manages a collection of <a href="http://www.openspace.org/">great walking trails</a> off
Skyline.<br><br><b>9. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=interstate+280+san+mateo">280</a></b><br><br>Silicon Valley has two highways running the length of it: 101, which
is pretty ugly, and 280, which is one of the more beautiful highways
in the world.  I always take 280 when I have a choice.  Notice the
long narrow lake to the west? That&apos;s the San Andreas Fault.  It
runs along the base of the hills, then heads uphill through Portola
Valley.  One of the MROSD trails runs <a href="http://www.openspace.org/preserves/pr_los_trancos.asp">right along
the fault</a>.  A string of rich neighborhoods runs along the
foothills to the west of 280: Woodside, Portola Valley, Los Altos
Hills, Saratoga, Los Gatos.<br><br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/38037974@N00/3890299362/">SLAC</a> goes right under 280 a little bit south of Sand Hill Road.  And a couple miles south of that is the Valley&apos;s equivalent of the &quot;Welcome to Las Vegas&quot; sign: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulbarroga/3443486941/">The Dish</a>.<br><br><br><br>

History Museum</a> because this is a list of where to see the Valley
itself, not where to see artifacts from it.  I also skipped San
Jose.  San Jose calls itself the capital of Silicon Valley, but
when people in the Valley use the phrase &quot;the city,&quot; they mean San
Francisco.  San Jose is a dotted line on a map.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, and Jessica Livingston

<p>
October 2010<br><br>After barely changing at all for decades, the startup funding
business is now in what could, at least by comparison, be called
turmoil.  At Y Combinator we&apos;ve seen dramatic changes in the funding
environment for startups.  Fortunately one of them is much higher
valuations.<br><br>The trends we&apos;ve been seeing are probably not YC-specific.  I wish
I could say they were, but the main cause is probably just that we
see trends first&#x2014;partly because the startups we fund are very
plugged into the Valley and are quick to take advantage of anything
new, and partly because we fund so many that we have enough data
points to see patterns clearly.<br><br>What we&apos;re seeing now, everyone&apos;s probably going to be seeing in
the next couple years.  So I&apos;m going to explain what we&apos;re seeing,
and what that will mean for you if you try to raise money.<br><br><b>Super-Angels</b><br><br>Let me start by describing what the world of startup funding used
to look like.  There used to be two sharply differentiated types
of investors: angels and venture capitalists.  Angels are individual
rich people who invest small amounts of their own money, while VCs
are employees of funds that invest large amounts of other people&apos;s.<br><br>For decades there were just those two types of investors, but now
a third type has appeared halfway between them: the so-called
super-angels. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
  And VCs have been provoked by their arrival
into making a lot of angel-style investments themselves.  So the
previously sharp line between angels and VCs has become hopelessly
blurred.<br><br>There used to be a no man&apos;s land between angels and VCs.  Angels
would invest $20k to $50k apiece, and VCs usually a million or more.
So an angel round meant a collection of angel investments that
combined to maybe $200k, and a VC round meant a series A round in
which a single VC fund (or occasionally two) invested $1-5 million.<br><br>The no man&apos;s land between angels and VCs was a very inconvenient
one for startups, because it coincided with the amount many wanted
to raise.  Most startups coming out of Demo Day wanted to raise
around $400k.  But it was a pain to stitch together that much out
of angel investments, and most VCs weren&apos;t interested in investments
so small.  That&apos;s the fundamental reason the super-angels have
appeared.  They&apos;re responding to the market.<br><br>The arrival of a new type of investor is big news for startups,
because there used to be only two and they rarely competed with one
another.  Super-angels compete with both angels and VCs.  That&apos;s
going to change the rules about how to raise money.  I don&apos;t know
yet what the new rules will be, but it looks like most of the changes
will be for the better.<br><br>A super-angel has some of the qualities of an angel, and some of
the qualities of a VC.  They&apos;re usually individuals, like angels.
In fact many of the current super-angels were initially angels of
the classic type.  But like VCs, they invest other people&apos;s money.
This allows them to invest larger amounts than angels:  a typical
super-angel investment is currently about $100k.  They make investment
decisions quickly, like angels.  And they make a lot more investments
per partner than VCs&#x2014;up to 10 times as many.<br><br>The fact that super-angels invest other people&apos;s money makes them
doubly alarming to VCs. They don&apos;t just compete for startups; they
also compete for investors.  What super-angels really are is a new
form of fast-moving, lightweight VC fund.   And those of us in the
technology world know what usually happens when something comes
along that can be described in terms like that.  Usually it&apos;s the
replacement.<br><br>Will it be?  As of now, few of the startups that take money from
super-angels are ruling out taking VC money.  They&apos;re just postponing
it.  But that&apos;s still a problem for VCs.  Some of the startups that
postpone raising VC money may do so well on the angel money they
raise that they never bother to raise more.  And those who do raise
VC rounds will be able to get higher valuations when they do.  If
the best startups get 10x higher valuations when they raise series
A rounds, that would cut VCs&apos; returns from winners at least tenfold.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>So I think VC funds are seriously threatened by the super-angels.
But one thing that may save them to some extent is the uneven
distribution of startup outcomes: practically all the returns are
concentrated in a few big successes.  The expected value of a startup
is the percentage chance it&apos;s Google.  So to the extent that winning
is a matter of absolute returns, the super-angels could win practically
all the battles for individual startups and yet lose the war, if
they merely failed to get those few big winners.  And there&apos;s a
chance that could happen, because the top VC funds have better
brands, and can also do more for their portfolio companies.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Because super-angels make more investments per partner, they have
less partner per investment.  They can&apos;t pay as much attention to
you as a VC on your board could.  How much is that extra attention
worth?  It will vary enormously from one partner to another.  There&apos;s
no consensus yet in the general case.  So for now this is something
startups are deciding individually.<br><br>Till now, VCs&apos; claims about how much value they added were sort of
like the government&apos;s.  Maybe they made you feel better, but you
had no choice in the matter, if you needed money on the scale only
VCs could supply.  Now that VCs have competitors, that&apos;s going to
put a market price on the help they offer.  The interesting thing
is, no one knows yet what it will be.<br><br>Do startups that want to get really big need the sort of advice and
connections only the top VCs can supply?  Or would super-angel money
do just as well?  The VCs will say you need them, and the super-angels
will say you don&apos;t.  But the truth is, no one knows yet, not even
the VCs and super-angels themselves.   All the super-angels know
is that their new model seems promising enough to be worth trying,
and all the VCs know is that it seems promising enough to worry
about.<br><br><b>Rounds</b><br><br>Whatever the outcome, the conflict between VCs and super-angels is
good news for founders.  And not just for the obvious reason that
more competition for deals means better terms.  The whole shape of
deals is changing.<br><br>One of the biggest differences between angels and VCs is the amount
of your company they want.  VCs want a lot.  In a series A round
they want a third of your company, if they can get it.  They don&apos;t
care much how much they pay for it, but they want a lot because the
number of series A investments they can do is so small.  In a
traditional series A investment, at least one partner from the VC
fund takes a seat on your board.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
 Since board seats last about
5 years and each partner can&apos;t handle more than about 10 at once,
that means a VC fund can only do about 2 series A deals per partner
per year. And that means they need to get as much of the company
as they can in each one.  You&apos;d have to be a very promising startup
indeed to get a VC to use up one of his 10 board seats for only a
few percent of you.<br><br>Since angels generally don&apos;t take board seats, they don&apos;t have this
constraint.  They&apos;re happy to buy only a few percent of you.  And
although the super-angels are in most respects mini VC funds, they&apos;ve
retained this critical property of angels.  They don&apos;t take board
seats, so they don&apos;t need a big percentage of your company.<br><br>Though that means you&apos;ll get correspondingly less attention from
them, it&apos;s good news in other respects.  Founders never really liked
giving up as much equity as VCs wanted.  It was a lot of the company
to give up in one shot.  Most founders doing series A deals would
prefer to take half as much money for half as much stock, and then
see what valuation they could get for the second half of the stock
after using the first half of the money to increase its value.  But
VCs never offered that option.<br><br>Now startups have another alternative.  Now it&apos;s easy to raise angel
rounds about half the size of series A rounds.  Many of the startups
we fund are taking this route, and I predict that will be true of
startups in general.<br><br>A typical big angel round might be $600k on a convertible note with
a valuation cap of $4 million premoney.  Meaning that when the note
converts into stock (in a later round, or upon acquisition), the
investors in that round will get .6 / 4.6, or 13% of the company.
That&apos;s a lot less than the 30 to 40% of the company you usually
give up in a series A round if you do it so early.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>But the advantage of these medium-sized rounds is not just that
they cause less dilution.  You also lose less control.  After an
angel round, the founders almost always still have control of the
company, whereas after a series A round they often don&apos;t.  The
traditional board structure after a series A round is two founders,
two VCs, and a (supposedly) neutral fifth person.  Plus series A
terms usually give the investors a veto over various kinds of
important decisions, including selling the company.  Founders usually
have a lot of de facto control after a series A, as long as things
are going well.  But that&apos;s not the same as just being able to do
what you want, like you could before.<br><br>A third and quite significant advantage of angel rounds is that
they&apos;re less stressful to raise.  Raising a traditional series A
round has in the past taken weeks, if not months.  When a VC firm
can only do 2 deals per partner per year, they&apos;re careful about
which they do.  To get a traditional series A round you have to go
through a series of meetings, culminating in a full partner meeting
where the firm as a whole says yes or no.  That&apos;s the really scary
part for founders: not just that series A rounds take so long, but
at the end of this long process the VCs might still say no.  The
chance of getting rejected after the full partner meeting averages
about 25%.  At some firms it&apos;s over 50%.<br><br>Fortunately for founders, VCs have been getting a lot faster.
Nowadays Valley VCs are more likely to take 2 weeks than 2 months.
But they&apos;re still not as fast as angels and super-angels, the most
decisive of whom sometimes decide in hours.<br><br>Raising an angel round is not only quicker, but you get feedback
as it progresses.  An angel round is not an all or nothing thing
like a series A.  It&apos;s composed of multiple investors with varying
degrees of seriousness, ranging from the upstanding ones who commit
unequivocally to the jerks who give you lines like &quot;come back to
me to fill out the round.&quot; You usually start collecting money from
the most committed investors and work your way out toward the
ambivalent ones, whose interest increases as the round fills up.<br><br>But at each point you know how you&apos;re doing.  If investors turn
cold you may have to raise less, but when investors in an angel
round turn cold the process at least degrades gracefully, instead
of blowing up in your face and leaving you with nothing, as happens
if you get rejected by a VC fund after a full partner meeting.
Whereas if investors seem hot, you can not only close the round
faster, but now that convertible notes are becoming the norm,
actually <a href="hiresfund.html">raise the price</a> to reflect demand.<br><br><b>Valuation</b><br><br>However, the VCs have a weapon they can use against the super-angels,
and they have started to use it.   VCs have started making angel-sized
investments too.  The term &quot;angel round&quot; doesn&apos;t mean that all the
investors in it are angels; it just describes the structure of the
round.  Increasingly the participants include VCs making investments
of a hundred thousand or two.  And when VCs invest in angel rounds
they can do things that super-angels don&apos;t like.  VCs are quite
valuation-insensitive in angel rounds&#x2014;partly because they are
in general, and partly because they don&apos;t care that much about the
returns on angel rounds, which they still view mostly as a way to
recruit startups for series A rounds later.  So VCs who invest in
angel rounds can blow up the valuations for angels and super-angels
who invest in them. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Some super-angels seem to care about valuations.  Several turned
down YC-funded startups after Demo Day because their valuations
were too high.  This was not a problem for the startups; by definition
a high valuation means enough investors were willing to accept it.
But it was mysterious to me that the super-angels would quibble
about valuations.  Did they not understand that the big returns
come from a few big successes, and that it therefore mattered far
more which startups you picked than how much you paid for them?<br><br>After thinking about it for a while and observing certain other
signs, I have a theory that explains why the super-angels may be
smarter than they seem.  It would make sense for super-angels to
want low valuations if they&apos;re hoping to invest in startups that
get bought early.  If you&apos;re hoping to hit the next Google, you
shouldn&apos;t care if the valuation is 20 million.  But if you&apos;re looking
for companies that are going to get bought for 30 million, you care.
If you invest at 20 and the company gets bought for 30, you only
get 1.5x.  You might as well buy Apple.<br><br>So if some of the super-angels were looking for companies that could
get acquired quickly, that would explain why they&apos;d care about
valuations.  But why would they be looking for those?   Because
depending on the meaning of &quot;quickly,&quot; it could actually be very
profitable.  A company that gets acquired for 30 million is a failure
to a VC, but it could be a 10x return for an angel, and moreover,
a <i>quick</i> 10x return.  Rate of return is what matters in
investing&#x2014;not the multiple you get, but the multiple per year.
If a super-angel gets 10x in one year, that&apos;s a higher rate of
return than a VC could ever hope to get from a company that took 6
years to go public.  To get the same rate of return, the VC would
have to get a multiple of 10^6&#x2014;one million x.  Even Google
didn&apos;t come close to that.<br><br>So I think at least some super-angels are looking for companies
that will get bought.  That&apos;s the only rational explanation for
focusing on getting the right valuations, instead of the right
companies.  And if so they&apos;ll be different to deal with than VCs.
They&apos;ll be tougher on valuations, but more accommodating if you want
to sell early.<br><br><b>Prognosis</b><br><br>Who will win, the super-angels or the VCs?  I think the answer to
that is, some of each.  They&apos;ll each become more like one another.
The super-angels will start to invest larger amounts, and the VCs
will gradually figure out ways to make more, smaller investments
faster.  A decade from now the players will be hard to tell apart,
and there will probably be survivors from each group.<br><br>What does that mean for founders?  One thing it means is that the
high valuations startups are presently getting may not last forever.
To the extent that valuations are being driven up by price-insensitive
VCs, they&apos;ll fall again if VCs become more like super-angels and
start to become more miserly about valuations.  Fortunately if this
does happen it will take years.<br><br>The short term forecast is more competition between investors, which
is good news for you.  The super-angels will try to undermine the
VCs by acting faster, and the VCs will try to undermine the
super-angels by driving up valuations.  Which for founders will
result in the perfect combination: funding rounds that close fast,
with high valuations.<br><br>But remember that to get that combination, your startup will have
to appeal to both super-angels and VCs.  If you don&apos;t seem like you
have the potential to go public, you won&apos;t be able to use VCs to
drive up the valuation of an angel round.<br><br>There is a danger of having VCs in an angel round: the so-called
signalling risk.  If VCs are only doing it in the hope of investing
more later, what happens if they don&apos;t?  That&apos;s a signal to everyone
else that they think you&apos;re lame.<br><br>How much should you worry about that?  The seriousness of signalling
risk depends on how far along you are.  If by the next time you
need to raise money, you have graphs showing rising revenue or
traffic month after month, you don&apos;t have to worry about any signals
your existing investors are sending.  Your results will speak for
themselves.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Whereas if the next time you need to raise money you won&apos;t yet have
concrete results, you may need to think more about the message your
investors might send if they don&apos;t invest more.  I&apos;m not sure yet
how much you have to worry, because this whole phenomenon of VCs
doing angel investments is so new. But my instincts tell me you
don&apos;t have to worry much.  Signalling risk smells like one of those
things founders worry about that&apos;s not a real problem.  As a rule,
the only thing that can kill a good startup is the startup itself.
Startups hurt themselves way more often than competitors hurt them,
for example.  I suspect signalling risk is in this category too.<br><br>One thing YC-funded startups have been doing to mitigate the risk
of taking money from VCs in angel rounds is not to take too much
from any one VC.  Maybe that will help, if you have the luxury of
turning down money.<br><br>Fortunately, more and more startups will.  After decades of competition
that could best be described as intramural, the startup funding
business is finally getting some real competition.  That should
last several years at least, and maybe a lot longer. Unless there&apos;s
some huge market crash, the next couple years are going to be a
good time for startups to raise money.  And that&apos;s exciting because
it means lots more startups will happen.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I&apos;ve also heard them called &quot;Mini-VCs&quot; and &quot;Micro-VCs.&quot; I
don&apos;t know which name will stick.<br><br>There were a couple predecessors.  Ron Conway had angel funds
starting in the 1990s, and in some ways First Round Capital is closer to a
super-angel than a VC fund.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
It wouldn&apos;t cut their overall returns tenfold, because investing
later would probably (a) cause them to lose less on investments
that failed, and (b) not allow them to get as large a percentage
of startups as they do now.  So it&apos;s hard to predict precisely what
would happen to their returns.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The brand of an investor derives mostly from the success of
their portfolio companies.  The top VCs thus have a big brand
advantage over the super-angels.  They could make it self-perpetuating
if they used it to get all the best new startups.  But I don&apos;t think
they&apos;ll be able to.  To get all the best startups, you have to do
more than make them want you.  You also have to want them; you have
to recognize them when you see them, and that&apos;s much harder.
Super-angels will snap up stars that VCs miss.  And that will cause
the brand gap between the top VCs and the super-angels gradually
to erode.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Though in a traditional series A round VCs put two partners
on your board, there are signs now that VCs may begin to conserve
board seats by switching to what used to be considered an angel-round
board, consisting of two founders and one VC.  Which is also to the
founders&apos; advantage if it means they still control the company.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
In a series A round, you usually have to give up more than
the actual amount of stock the VCs buy, because they insist you
dilute yourselves to set aside an &quot;option pool&quot; as well.  I predict
this practice will gradually disappear though.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
The best thing for founders, if they can get it, is a convertible
note with no valuation cap at all.  In that case the money invested
in the angel round just converts into stock at the valuation of the
next round, no matter how large.  Angels and super-angels tend not
to like uncapped notes. They have no idea how much of the company
they&apos;re buying.  If the company does well and the valuation of the
next round is high, they may end up with only a sliver of it.  So
by agreeing to uncapped notes, VCs who don&apos;t care about valuations
in angel rounds can make offers that super-angels hate to match.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Obviously signalling risk is also not a problem if you&apos;ll
never need to raise more money.  But startups are often mistaken
about that.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, John Bautista, Patrick Collison, James

<p>
October 2010
</p><p>
<i>(I wrote this for Forbes, who asked me to write something
about the qualities we look for in founders.  In print they had to cut
the last item because they didn&apos;t have room.)</i><br><br><b>1. Determination</b><br><br>This has turned out to be the most important quality in startup
founders.  We thought when we started Y Combinator that the most
important quality would be intelligence.  That&apos;s the myth in the
Valley. And certainly you don&apos;t want founders to be stupid.  But
as long as you&apos;re over a certain threshold of intelligence, what
matters most is determination.  You&apos;re going to hit a lot of
obstacles.  You can&apos;t be the sort of person who gets <a href="die.html">demoralized</a>
easily.<br><br>Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman of <a href="http://wepay.com">WePay</a> 
are a good example.  They&apos;re
doing a finance startup, which means endless negotiations with big,
bureaucratic companies.  When you&apos;re starting a startup that depends
on deals with big companies to exist, it often feels like they&apos;re
trying to ignore you out of existence.  But when Bill Clerico starts
calling you, you may as well do what he asks, because he is not
going away.<br><br>
<b>2. Flexibility</b><br><br>You do not however want the sort of determination implied by phrases
like &quot;don&apos;t give up on your dreams.&quot;  The world of startups is so
unpredictable that you need to be able to modify your dreams on the
fly.  The best metaphor I&apos;ve found for the combination of determination
and flexibility you need is a <a href="relres.html">running back</a>.  
He&apos;s determined to get
downfield, but at any given moment he may need to go sideways or
even backwards to get there.<br><br>The current record holder for flexibility may be Daniel Gross of
<a href="http://greplin.com">Greplin</a>.  He applied to YC with 
some bad ecommerce idea.  We told
him we&apos;d fund him if he did something else.  He thought for a second,
and said ok.  He then went through two more ideas before settling
on Greplin.  He&apos;d only been working on it for a couple days when
he presented to investors at Demo Day, but he got a lot of interest.
He always seems to land on his feet.<br><br>
<b>3. Imagination</b><br><br>Intelligence does matter a lot of course.  It seems like the type
that matters most is imagination.  It&apos;s not so important to be able
to solve predefined problems quickly as to be able to come up with
surprising new ideas.  In the startup world, most good ideas 
<a href="googles.html">seem
bad</a> initially.  If they were obviously good, someone would already
be doing them.  So you need the kind of intelligence that produces
ideas with just the right level of craziness.<br><br><a href="http://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a> is that kind of idea.  
In fact, when we funded Airbnb, we
thought it was too crazy.  We couldn&apos;t believe large numbers of
people would want to stay in other people&apos;s places.  We funded them
because we liked the founders so much.  As soon as we heard they&apos;d
been supporting themselves by selling Obama and McCain branded
breakfast cereal, they were in.  And it turned out the idea was on
the right side of crazy after all.<br><br>
<b>4. Naughtiness</b><br><br>Though the most successful founders are usually good people, they
tend to have a piratical gleam in their eye.  They&apos;re not Goody
Two-Shoes type good.  Morally, they care about getting the big
questions right, but not about observing proprieties.  That&apos;s why
I&apos;d use the word naughty rather than evil.  They delight in 
<a href="gba.html">breaking
rules</a>, but not rules that matter.  This quality may be redundant
though; it may be implied by imagination.<br><br>Sam Altman of <a href="http://loopt.com">Loopt</a> 
is one of the most successful alumni, so we
asked him what question we could put on the Y Combinator application
that would help us discover more people like him.  He said to ask
about a time when they&apos;d hacked something to their advantage&#x2014;hacked in the sense of beating the system, not breaking into
computers.  It has become one of the questions we pay most attention
to when judging applications.<br><br>
<b>5. Friendship</b><br><br>Empirically it seems to be hard to start a startup with just 
<a href="startupmistakes.html">one
founder</a>.  Most of the big successes have two or three.  And the
relationship between the founders has to be strong.  They must
genuinely like one another, and work well together.  Startups do
to the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock:
if it can be pulled apart, it will be.<br><br>Emmett Shear and Justin Kan of <a href="http://justin.tv">Justin.tv</a> 
are a good example of close
friends who work well together.  They&apos;ve known each other since
second grade.  They can practically read one another&apos;s minds.  I&apos;m
sure they argue, like all founders, but I have never once sensed
any unresolved tension between them.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston and Chris Steiner for reading drafts of this.<br><br></p></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="tablets">Tablets</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">December 2010<br><br>I was thinking recently how inconvenient it was not to have a general
term for iPhones, iPads, and the corresponding things running
Android.  The closest to a general term seems to be &quot;mobile devices,&quot;
but that (a) applies to any mobile phone, and (b) doesn&apos;t really
capture what&apos;s distinctive about the iPad.<br><br>After a few seconds it struck me that what we&apos;ll end up calling
these things is tablets.  The only reason we even consider calling
them &quot;mobile devices&quot; is that the iPhone preceded the iPad.  If the
iPad had come first, we wouldn&apos;t think of the iPhone as a phone;
we&apos;d think of it as a tablet small enough to hold up to your ear.<br><br>The iPhone isn&apos;t so much a phone as a replacement for a phone.
That&apos;s an important distinction, because it&apos;s an early instance of
what will become a common pattern.  Many if not most of the
special-purpose objects around us are going to be replaced by apps
running on tablets.<br><br>This is already clear in cases like GPSes, music players, and
cameras.  But I think it will surprise people how many things are
going to get replaced.  We funded one startup that&apos;s 
<a href="http://lockitron.com/">replacing keys</a>.
The fact that you can change font sizes easily means the iPad
effectively replaces reading glasses.  I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if
by playing some clever tricks with the accelerometer you could even
replace the bathroom scale.<br><br>The advantages of doing things in software on a single device are
so great that everything that can get turned into software will.
So for the next couple years, a good <a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs8.html">recipe for startups</a>
will be to look around you for things that people haven&apos;t realized
yet can be made unnecessary by a tablet app.<br><br>In 1938 Buckminster Fuller coined the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeralization">ephemeralization</a> to
describe the increasing tendency of physical machinery to be replaced
by what we would now call software.  The reason tablets are going
to take over the world is not (just) that Steve Jobs and Co are
industrial design wizards, but because they have this force behind
them.  The iPhone and the iPad have effectively drilled a hole that
will allow ephemeralization to flow into a lot of new areas.  No one
who has studied the history of technology would want to underestimate
the power of that force.<br><br>I worry about the power Apple could have with this force behind
them.  I don&apos;t want to see another era of client monoculture like
the Microsoft one in the 80s and 90s.  But if ephemeralization is
one of the main forces driving the spread of tablets, that suggests
a way to compete with Apple: be a better platform for it.<br><br>It has turned out to be a great thing that Apple tablets have
accelerometers in them.  Developers have used the accelerometer in
ways Apple could never have imagined.  That&apos;s the nature of platforms.
The more versatile the tool, the less you can predict how people
will use it.  So tablet makers should be thinking: what else can
we put in there?  Not merely hardware, but software too.  What else
can we give developers access to?  Give hackers an inch and they&apos;ll
take you a mile.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>
December 2010<br><br>Someone we funded is talking to VCs now, and asked me how common
it was for a startup&apos;s founders to retain control of the board after
a series A round.  He said VCs told him this almost never happened.<br><br>Ten years ago that was true.  In the past, founders rarely kept
control of the board through a series A.  The traditional series A
board consisted of two founders, two VCs, and one independent member.
More recently the recipe is often one founder, one VC, and one
independent.  In either case the founders lose their majority.<br><br>But not always.  Mark Zuckerberg kept control of Facebook&apos;s board
through the series A and still has it today.  Mark Pincus has kept
control of Zynga&apos;s too.  But are these just outliers?  How common
is it for founders to keep control after an A round?  I&apos;d heard of
several cases among the companies we&apos;ve funded, but I wasn&apos;t sure
how many there were, so I emailed the ycfounders list.<br><br>The replies surprised me.  In a dozen companies we&apos;ve funded, the
founders still had a majority of the board seats after the series
A round.<br><br>I feel like we&apos;re at a tipping point here.  A lot of VCs still act
as if founders retaining board control after a series A is unheard-of.
A lot of them try to make you feel bad if you even ask&#x2014;as if
you&apos;re a noob or a control freak for wanting such a thing.  But the
founders I heard from aren&apos;t noobs or control freaks.  Or if they
are, they are, like Mark Zuckerberg, the kind of noobs and control
freaks VCs should be trying to fund more of.<br><br>Founders retaining control after a series A is clearly heard-of.
And barring financial catastrophe, I think in the coming year it
will become the norm.<br><br>Control of a company is a more complicated matter than simply
outvoting other parties in board meetings.  Investors usually get
vetos over certain big decisions, like selling the company, regardless
of how many board seats they have.  And board votes are rarely
split.  Matters are decided in the discussion preceding the vote,
not in the vote itself, which is usually unanimous.  But if opinion
is divided in such discussions, the side that knows it would lose
in a vote will tend to be less insistent.  That&apos;s what board control
means in practice.  You don&apos;t simply get to do whatever you want;
the board still has to act in the interest of the shareholders; but
if you have a majority of board seats, then your opinion about
what&apos;s in the interest of the shareholders will tend to prevail.<br><br>So while board control is not total control, it&apos;s not imaginary
either.  There&apos;s inevitably a difference in how things feel within
the company.  Which means if it becomes the norm for founders to
retain board control after a series A, that will change the way
things feel in the whole startup world.<br><br>The switch to the new norm may be surprisingly fast, because the
startups that can retain control tend to be the best ones.  They&apos;re
the ones that set the trends, both for other startups and for VCs.<br><br>A lot of the reason VCs are harsh when negotiating with startups
is that they&apos;re embarrassed to go back to their partners looking
like they got beaten.  When they sign a termsheet, they want to be
able to brag about the good terms they got.  A lot of them don&apos;t
care that much personally about whether founders keep board control.
They just don&apos;t want to seem like they had to make concessions.
Which means if letting the founders keep control stops being perceived
as a concession, it will rapidly become much more common.<br><br>Like a lot of changes that have been forced on VCs, this change
won&apos;t turn out to be as big a problem as they might think. VCs will
still be able to convince; they just won&apos;t be able to compel.  And
the startups where they have to resort to compulsion are not the
ones that matter anyway.  VCs make most of their money from a few
big hits, and those aren&apos;t them.<br><br>Knowing that founders will keep control of the board may even help
VCs pick better.  If they know they can&apos;t fire the founders, they&apos;ll
have to choose founders they can trust.  And that&apos;s who they should
have been choosing all along.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, John Bautista, Trevor Blackwell, Paul

investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio

problem without waiting for the government.<br><br>I&apos;ve never been 100% sure whether patents help or hinder technological
progress.  When I was a kid I thought they helped.  I thought they
protected inventors from having their ideas stolen by big companies.
Maybe that was truer in the past, when more things were physical.
But regardless of whether patents are in general a good thing, there
do seem to be bad ways of using them.  And since bad uses of patents
seem to be increasing, there is an increasing call for patent reform.<br><br>The problem with patent reform is that it has to go through the
government.  That tends to be slow.  But recently I realized we can
also attack the problem downstream.  As well as pinching off the
stream of patents at the point where they&apos;re issued, we may in some
cases be able to pinch it off at the point where they&apos;re used.<br><br>One way of using patents that clearly does not encourage innovation
is when established companies with bad products use patents to
suppress small competitors with good products.  This is the type
of abuse we may be able to decrease without having to go through
the government.<br><br>The way to do it is to get the companies that are above pulling
this sort of trick to pledge publicly not to.  Then the ones that
won&apos;t make such a pledge will be very conspicuous.  Potential
employees won&apos;t want to work for them.  And investors, too, will
be able to see that they&apos;re the sort of company that competes by
litigation rather than by making good products.<br><br>Here&apos;s the pledge:
<blockquote>
    No first use of software patents against companies with less 
    than 25 people.
</blockquote>
I&apos;ve deliberately traded precision for brevity.  The patent pledge
is not legally binding.  It&apos;s like Google&apos;s &quot;Don&apos;t be evil.&quot; They
don&apos;t define what evil is, but by publicly saying that, they&apos;re
saying they&apos;re willing to be held to a standard that, say, Altria
is not.  And though constraining, &quot;Don&apos;t be evil&quot; has been good for
Google. Technology companies win by attracting the most productive
people, and the most productive people are attracted to employers
who hold themselves to a higher standard than the law requires.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The patent pledge is in effect a narrower but open source &quot;Don&apos;t
be evil.&quot;  I encourage every technology company to adopt it.  If
you want to help fix patents, encourage your employer to.<br><br>Already most technology companies wouldn&apos;t sink to using patents
on startups.  You don&apos;t see Google or Facebook suing startups for
patent infringement. They don&apos;t need to.  So for the better technology
companies, the patent pledge requires no change in behavior.  They&apos;re
just promising to do what they&apos;d do anyway.  And when all the
companies that won&apos;t use patents on startups have said so, the
holdouts will be very conspicuous.<br><br>The patent pledge doesn&apos;t fix every problem with patents.  It won&apos;t
stop patent trolls, for example; they&apos;re already pariahs.  But the
problem the patent pledge does fix may be more serious than the
problem of patent trolls.  Patent trolls are just parasites.  A
clumsy parasite may occasionally kill the host, but that&apos;s not its
goal.  Whereas companies that sue startups for patent infringement
generally do it with explicit goal of keeping their product off the
market.<br><br>Companies that use patents on startups are attacking innovation at
the root.  Now there&apos;s something any individual can do about this
problem, without waiting for the government: ask companies where
they stand.<br><br><br><br>
<a href="http://thepatentpledge.org">Patent Pledge Site</a><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes:</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Because the pledge is deliberately vague, we&apos;re going to need
common sense when intepreting it.  And even more vice versa: the
pledge is vague in order to make people use common sense when
interpreting it.<br><br>So for example I&apos;ve deliberately avoided saying whether the 25
people have to be employees, or whether contractors count too.  If
a company has to split hairs that fine about whether a suit would
violate the patent pledge, it&apos;s probably still a dick move.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2272_1423" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://k9ventures.com/blog/2011/04/27/modista/">The Investment That Didn&apos;t Happen</a><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></td></tr></table><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="hubs">Why Startup Hubs Work</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">
<p>
October 2011<br><br>If you look at a list of US cities sorted by population, the number
of successful startups per capita varies by orders of magnitude.
Somehow it&apos;s as if most places were sprayed with startupicide.<br><br>I wondered about this for years.  I could see the average town was
like a roach motel for startup ambitions: smart, ambitious people
went in, but no startups came out.  But I was never able to figure
out exactly what happened inside the motel&#x2014;exactly what was
killing all the potential startups.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>A couple weeks ago I finally figured it out. I was framing the
question wrong.  The problem is not that most towns kill startups.
It&apos;s that death is the <a href="die.html">default</a> for startups,
and most towns don&apos;t save them.  Instead of thinking of most places
as being sprayed with startupicide, it&apos;s more accurate to think of
startups as all being poisoned, and a few places being sprayed with
the antidote.<br><br>Startups in other places are just doing what startups naturally do:
fail.  The real question is, what&apos;s <i>saving</i> startups in places
like Silicon Valley?
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Environment</b><br><br>I think there are two components to the antidote: being in a place
where startups are the cool thing to do, and chance meetings with
people who can help you.  And what drives them both is the number
of startup people around you.<br><br>The first component is particularly helpful in the first stage of
a startup&apos;s life, when you go from merely having an interest in
starting a company to actually doing it.  It&apos;s quite a leap to start
a startup.  It&apos;s an unusual thing to do. But in Silicon Valley it
seems normal.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>In most places, if you start a startup, people treat you as if
you&apos;re unemployed.  People in the Valley aren&apos;t automatically
impressed with you just because you&apos;re starting a company, but they
pay attention.  Anyone who&apos;s been here any amount of time knows not
to default to skepticism, no matter how inexperienced you seem or
how unpromising your idea sounds at first, because they&apos;ve all seen
inexperienced founders with unpromising sounding ideas who a few
years later were billionaires.<br><br>Having people around you care about what you&apos;re doing is an
extraordinarily <a href="cities.html">powerful</a> force.  Even the
most willful people are susceptible to it.  About a year after we
started Y Combinator I said something to a partner at a well known
VC firm that gave him the (mistaken) impression I was considering
starting another startup.  He responded so eagerly that for about
half a second I found myself considering doing it.<br><br>In most other cities, the prospect of starting a startup just doesn&apos;t
seem real.  In the Valley it&apos;s not only real but fashionable.  That
no doubt causes a lot of people to start startups who shouldn&apos;t.
But I think that&apos;s ok.  Few people are suited to running a startup,
and it&apos;s very hard to predict beforehand which are (as I know all
too well from being in the business of trying to predict beforehand),
so lots of people starting startups who shouldn&apos;t is probably the
optimal state of affairs.  As long as you&apos;re at a point in your
life when you can bear the risk of failure, the best way to find
out if you&apos;re suited to running a startup is to <a href="notnot.html">try
it</a>.<br><br><b>Chance</b><br><br>The second component of the antidote is chance meetings with people
who can help you.  This force works in both phases: both in the
transition from the desire to start a startup to starting one, and
the transition from starting a company to succeeding.  The power
of chance meetings is more variable than people around you caring
about startups, which is like a sort of background radiation that
affects everyone equally, but at its strongest it is far stronger.<br><br>Chance meetings produce miracles to compensate for the disasters
that characteristically befall startups.  In the Valley, terrible
things happen to startups all the time, just like they do to startups
everywhere.  The reason startups are more likely to make it here
is that great things happen to them too.  In the Valley, lightning
has a sign bit.<br><br>For example, you start a site for college students and you decide
to move to the Valley for the summer to work on it.  And then on a
random suburban street in Palo Alto you happen to run into Sean
Parker, who understands the domain really well because he started
a similar startup himself, and also knows all the investors.  And
moreover has advanced views, for 2004, on founders retaining <a href="control.html">control</a> of their companies.<br><br>You can&apos;t say precisely what the miracle will be, or even for sure
that one will happen.  The best one can say is: if you&apos;re in a
startup hub, unexpected good things will probably happen to you,
especially if you deserve them.<br><br>I bet this is true even for startups we fund.  Even with us working
to make things happen for them on purpose rather than by accident,
the frequency of helpful chance meetings in the Valley is so high
that it&apos;s still a significant increment on what we can deliver.<br><br>Chance meetings play a role like the role relaxation plays in having
ideas.  Most people have had the experience of working hard on some
problem, not being able to solve it, giving up and going to bed,
and then thinking of the answer in the shower in the morning.  What
makes the answer appear is letting your thoughts <a href="top.html">drift</a> a bit&#x2014;and thus drift off the wrong
path you&apos;d been pursuing last night and onto the right one adjacent
to it.<br><br>Chance meetings let your acquaintance drift in the same way taking
a shower lets your thoughts drift. The critical thing in both cases
is that they drift just the right amount.  The meeting between Larry
Page and Sergey Brin was a good example.  They let their acquaintance
drift, but only a little; they were both meeting someone they had
a lot in common with.<br><br>For Larry Page the most important component of the antidote was
Sergey Brin, and vice versa.  The antidote is 
<a href="siliconvalley.html">people</a>.  It&apos;s not the
physical infrastructure of Silicon Valley that makes it work, or
the weather, or anything like that.  Those helped get it started,
but now that the reaction is self-sustaining what drives it is the
people.<br><br>Many observers have noticed that one of the most distinctive things
about startup hubs is the degree to which people help one another
out, with no expectation of getting anything in return.  I&apos;m not
sure why this is so.  Perhaps it&apos;s because startups are less of a
zero sum game than most types of business; they are rarely killed
by competitors.  Or perhaps it&apos;s because so many startup founders
have backgrounds in the sciences, where collaboration is encouraged.<br><br>A large part of YC&apos;s function is to accelerate that process.  We&apos;re
a sort of Valley within the Valley, where the density of people
working on startups and their willingness to help one another are
both artificially amplified.<br><br><b>Numbers</b><br><br>Both components of the antidote&#x2014;an environment that encourages
startups, and chance meetings with people who help you&#x2014;are
driven by the same underlying cause: the number of startup people
around you.  To make a startup hub, you need a <i>lot</i> of people
interested in startups.<br><br>There are three reasons. The first, obviously, is that if you don&apos;t
have enough density, the chance meetings don&apos;t happen.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
The second is that different startups need such different things, so
you need a lot of people to supply each startup with what they need
most.  Sean Parker was exactly what Facebook needed in 2004.  Another
startup might have needed a database guy, or someone with connections
in the movie business.<br><br>This is one of the reasons we fund such a large number of companies,
incidentally.  The bigger the community, the greater the chance it
will contain the person who has that one thing you need most.<br><br>The third reason you need a lot of people to make a startup hub is
that once you have enough people interested in the same problem,
they start to set the social norms.  And it is a particularly
valuable thing when the atmosphere around you encourages you to do
something that would otherwise seem too ambitious.  In most places
the atmosphere pulls you back toward the mean.<br><br>I flew into the Bay Area a few days ago.  I notice this every time
I fly over the Valley: somehow you can sense something is going on.  
Obviously you can sense prosperity in how well kept a
place looks.  But there are different kinds of prosperity.  Silicon
Valley doesn&apos;t look like Boston, or New York, or LA, or DC.  I tried
asking myself what word I&apos;d use to describe the feeling the Valley
radiated, and the word that came to mind was optimism.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s impossible to succeed in a city with few
other startups, just harder.  If you&apos;re sufficiently good at
generating your own morale, you can survive without external
encouragement.  Wufoo was based in Tampa and they succeeded.  But
the Wufoos are exceptionally disciplined.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Incidentally, this phenomenon is not limited to startups.  Most
unusual ambitions fail, unless the person who has them manages to
find the right sort of community.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Starting a company is common, but starting a startup is rare.
I&apos;ve talked about the distinction between the two elsewhere, but
essentially a startup is a new business designed for scale.  Most
new businesses are service businesses and except in rare cases those
don&apos;t scale.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
As I was writing this, I had a demonstration of the density of
startup people in the Valley.  Jessica and I bicycled to University
Ave in Palo Alto to have lunch at the fabulous Oren&apos;s Hummus.  As
we walked in, we met Charlie Cheever sitting near the door.  Selina
Tobaccowala stopped to say hello on her way out.  Then Josh Wilson
came in to pick up a take out order.  After lunch we went to get
frozen yogurt.  On the way we met Rajat Suri.  When we got to the
yogurt place, we found Dave Shen there, and as we walked out we ran
into Yuri Sagalov.  We walked with him for a block or so and we ran
into Muzzammil Zaveri, and then a block later we met Aydin Senkut.
This is everyday life in Palo Alto.  I wasn&apos;t trying to meet people;
I was just having lunch.  And I&apos;m sure for every startup founder
or investor I saw that I knew, there were 5 more I didn&apos;t.  If Ron
Conway had been with us he would have met 30 people he knew.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, and

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberCash,_Inc.">Cybercash</a>,
since if we lacked that feature we&apos;d have gotten beaten up in product

were so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/cybercash.html">talk merchants

colocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things
went wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or
more precisely, in Trevor&apos;s office.  In return for the unique

the version number <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/rel4.html">an
integer</a>.  That &quot;version 4.0&quot; icon was generated by our own
button generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made
with our software, even though it wasn&apos;t an online store, because
we wanted to experience what our users did.<br><br>At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search
engine called <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/shoprel.html">Shopfind</a>.  It
was pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler
that could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out
the products.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="schlep">Schlep Blindness</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">
<p>
January 2012<br><br>There are great startup ideas lying around unexploited right under
our noses.  One reason we don&apos;t see them is a phenomenon I call
<i>schlep blindness</i>.  Schlep was originally a Yiddish word but has
passed into general use in the US.  It means a tedious, unpleasant
task.<br><br>No one likes schleps, but hackers especially dislike them.  
Most hackers who start startups wish they could do it by just writing
some clever software, putting it on a server somewhere, and watching
the money roll in&#x2014;without ever having to talk to users, or negotiate
with other companies, or deal with other people&apos;s broken code.
Maybe that&apos;s possible, but I haven&apos;t seen it.<br><br>One of the many things we do at Y Combinator is teach hackers about
the inevitability of schleps.  No, you can&apos;t start a startup by
just writing code.  I remember going through this realization myself.
There was a point in 1995 when I was still trying to convince myself
I could start a company by just writing code.  But I soon learned
from experience that schleps are not merely inevitable, but pretty
much what business consists of.  A company is defined by the schleps
it will undertake.  And schleps should be dealt with the same way
you&apos;d deal with a cold swimming pool: just jump in.  Which is not
to say you should seek out unpleasant work per se, but that you
should never shrink from it if it&apos;s on the path to something great.<br><br>The most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps is that much
of it is unconscious.  Your unconscious won&apos;t even let you see ideas
that involve painful schleps.  That&apos;s schlep blindness.<br><br>The phenomenon isn&apos;t limited to startups.  Most people don&apos;t
consciously decide not to be in as good physical shape as Olympic
athletes, for example.  Their unconscious mind decides for them,
shrinking from the work involved.<br><br>The most striking example I know of schlep blindness is 
<a href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, or
rather Stripe&apos;s idea.  For over a decade, every hacker who&apos;d ever
had to process payments online knew how painful the experience was.
Thousands of people must have known about this problem.  And yet
when they started startups, they decided to build recipe sites, or
aggregators for local events.  Why?  Why work on problems few care
much about and no one will pay for, when you could fix one of the
most important components of the world&apos;s infrastructure?  Because
schlep blindness prevented people from even considering the idea
of fixing payments.<br><br>Probably no one who applied to Y Combinator to work on a recipe
site began by asking &quot;should we fix payments, or build a recipe
site?&quot; and chose the recipe site.  Though the idea of fixing payments
was right there in plain sight, they never saw it, because their
unconscious mind shrank from the complications involved.  You&apos;d
have to make deals with banks.  How do you do that?  Plus you&apos;re
moving money, so you&apos;re going to have to deal with fraud, and people
trying to break into your servers.  Plus there are probably all
sorts of regulations to comply with.  It&apos;s a lot more intimidating
to start a startup like this than a recipe site.<br><br>That scariness makes ambitious ideas doubly valuable.  In addition
to their intrinsic value, they&apos;re like undervalued stocks in the
sense that there&apos;s less demand for them among founders.  If you
pick an ambitious idea, you&apos;ll have less competition, because
everyone else will have been frightened off by the challenges
involved.  (This is also true of starting a startup generally.)<br><br>How do you overcome schlep blindness?  Frankly, the most valuable
antidote to schlep blindness is probably ignorance.  Most successful
founders would probably say that if they&apos;d known when they were
starting their company about the obstacles they&apos;d have to overcome,
they might never have started it.  Maybe that&apos;s one reason the most
successful startups of all so often have young founders.<br><br>In practice the founders grow with the problems.  But no one seems
able to foresee that, not even older, more experienced founders.
So the reason younger founders have an advantage is that they make
two mistakes that cancel each other out.  They don&apos;t know how much
they can grow, but they also don&apos;t know how much they&apos;ll need to.
Older founders only make the first mistake.<br><br>Ignorance can&apos;t solve everything though.  Some ideas so obviously
entail alarming schleps that anyone can see them.  How do you see
ideas like that?  The trick I recommend is to take yourself out of
the picture.  Instead of asking &quot;what problem should I solve?&quot; ask
&quot;what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?&quot;  If someone
who had to process payments before Stripe had tried asking that,
Stripe would have been one of the first things they wished for.<br><br>It&apos;s too late now to be Stripe, but there&apos;s plenty still broken in
the world, if you know how to see it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison,

<p>
January 2012<br><br>A year ago I noticed a pattern in the least successful startups
we&apos;d funded: they all seemed hard to talk to.  It felt as if there
was some kind of wall between us.  I could never quite tell if they
understood what I was saying.<br><br>This caught my attention because earlier we&apos;d noticed a pattern
among the most successful startups, and it seemed to hinge on a
different quality.  We found the startups that did best were the
ones with the sort of founders about whom we&apos;d say &quot;they can take
care of themselves.&quot;  The startups that do best are fire-and-forget
in the sense that all you have to do is give them a lead, and they&apos;ll
close it, whatever type of lead it is.  When they&apos;re raising money,
for example, you can do the initial intros knowing that if you
wanted to you could stop thinking about it at that point.  You won&apos;t
have to babysit the round to make sure it happens.  That type of
founder is going to come back with the money; the only question is
how much on what terms.<br><br>It seemed odd that the outliers at the two ends of the spectrum
could be detected by what appeared to be unrelated tests.  You&apos;d
expect that if the founders at one end were distinguished by the
presence of quality x, at the other end they&apos;d be distinguished by
lack of x.  Was there some kind of inverse relation between
<a href="relres.html">resourcefulness</a> and being hard to talk to?<br><br>It turns out there is, and the key to the mystery is the old adage
&quot;a word to the wise is sufficient.&quot;   Because this phrase is not
only overused, but overused in an indirect way (by prepending the
subject to some advice), most people who&apos;ve heard it don&apos;t know
what it means.  What it means is that if someone is wise, all you
have to do is say one word to them, and they&apos;ll understand immediately.
You don&apos;t have to explain in detail; they&apos;ll chase down all the
implications.<br><br>In much the same way that all you have to do is give the right sort
of founder a one line intro to a VC, and he&apos;ll chase down the money.
That&apos;s the connection.  Understanding all the implications&#x2014;even the
inconvenient implications&#x2014;of what someone tells you is a subset of
resourcefulness.  It&apos;s conversational resourcefulness.<br><br>Like real world resourcefulness, conversational resourcefulness
often means doing things you don&apos;t want to.  Chasing down all the
implications of what&apos;s said to you can sometimes lead to uncomfortable
conclusions.  The best word to describe the failure to do so is
probably &quot;denial,&quot; though that seems a bit too narrow.  A better
way to describe the situation would be to say that the unsuccessful
founders had the sort of conservatism that comes from weakness.
They traversed idea space as gingerly as a very old person
traverses the physical world.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The unsuccessful founders weren&apos;t stupid.  Intellectually they
were as capable as
the successful founders of following all the implications of what
one said to them.  They just weren&apos;t eager to.<br><br>So being hard to talk to was not what was killing the
unsuccessful startups.  It
was a sign of an underlying lack of resourcefulness.  That&apos;s what
was killing them.  As well as
failing to chase down the implications of what was said to them,
the unsuccessful founders would also fail to chase down funding,
and users, and sources of new ideas.  But the most immediate evidence
I had that something was amiss was that I couldn&apos;t talk to them.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]

<p>
March 2012<br><br>One of the more surprising things I&apos;ve noticed while working
on Y Combinator is how frightening the most ambitious startup
ideas are.  In this essay I&apos;m going to demonstrate
this phenomenon by describing some.  Any one of them
could make you a billionaire.  That might sound like an attractive
prospect, and yet when I describe these ideas you may
notice you find yourself shrinking away from them.<br><br>Don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not a sign of weakness.  Arguably it&apos;s a sign of
sanity.  The biggest startup ideas are terrifying.  And not just
because they&apos;d be a lot of work.  The biggest ideas seem to threaten
your identity: you wonder if you&apos;d have enough ambition to carry
them through.<br><br>There&apos;s a scene in <i>Being John Malkovich</i> where the nerdy hero
encounters a very attractive, sophisticated woman.  She says to
him:
<blockquote>
  Here&apos;s the thing: If you ever got me, you wouldn&apos;t have a clue
  what to do with me.
</blockquote>
That&apos;s what these ideas say to us.<br><br>This phenomenon is one of the most important things you can understand
about startups.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
You&apos;d expect big startup ideas to be
attractive, but actually they tend to repel you.  And that has a
bunch of consequences.  It means these ideas are invisible to most
people who try to think of startup ideas, because their subconscious
filters them out.  Even the most ambitious people are probably best
off approaching them obliquely.<br><br><b>1. A New Search Engine</b><br><br>The best ideas are just on the right side of impossible.  I don&apos;t
know if this one is possible, but there are signs it might be.
Making a new search engine means competing with Google, and recently
I&apos;ve noticed some cracks in their fortress.<br><br>The point when it became clear to me that Microsoft had lost their
way was when they decided to get into the search business.  That
was not a natural move for Microsoft.  They did it because they
were afraid of Google, and Google was in the search business.  But
this meant (a) Google was now setting Microsoft&apos;s agenda, and (b)
Microsoft&apos;s agenda consisted of stuff they weren&apos;t good at.<br><br>Microsoft : Google :: Google : Facebook.<br><br>That does not by itself mean
there&apos;s room for a new search engine, but lately when using Google
search I&apos;ve found myself nostalgic for the old days, when
Google was true to its own slightly aspy self.  Google used to give
me a page of the right answers, fast, with no clutter.  Now the
results seem inspired by the Scientologist principle that what&apos;s
true is what&apos;s true for you.  And the pages don&apos;t have the
clean, sparse feel they used to.  Google search results used to
look like the output of a Unix utility.  Now if I accidentally put
the cursor in the wrong place, anything might happen.<br><br>The way to win here is to build the search engine all the hackers
use.  A search engine whose users consisted of the top 10,000 hackers
and no one else would be in a very powerful position despite its
small size, just as Google was when it was that search engine.  And
for the first time in over a decade the idea of switching seems
thinkable to me.<br><br>Since anyone capable of starting this company is one of those 10,000
hackers, the route is at least straightforward: make the search
engine you yourself want.  Feel free to make it excessively hackerish.
Make it really good for code search, for example.  Would you like
search queries to be Turing complete?  Anything that gets you those
10,000 users is ipso facto good.<br><br>Don&apos;t worry if something you want to do will constrain you in the
long term, because if you don&apos;t get that initial core of users,
there won&apos;t be a long term.  If you can just build something that
you and your friends genuinely prefer to Google, you&apos;re already
about 10% of the way to an IPO, just as Facebook was (though they
probably didn&apos;t realize it) when they got all the Harvard undergrads.<br><br><b>2. Replace Email</b><br><br>Email was not designed to be used the way we use it now.  Email is
not a messaging protocol.  It&apos;s a todo list.  Or rather, my inbox
is a todo list, and email is the way things get onto it.  But it
is a disastrously bad todo list.<br><br>I&apos;m open to different types of solutions to this problem, but I
suspect that tweaking the inbox is not enough, and that email has
to be replaced with a new protocol. 
This new protocol should be a todo list protocol, not
a messaging protocol, although there is a degenerate case where
what someone wants you to do is: read the following text.<br><br>As a todo list protocol, the new protocol should give more power
to the recipient than email does.  I want there to be more restrictions
on what someone can put on my todo list.  And when someone can put
something on my todo list, I want them to tell me more about what
they want from me.  Do they want me to do something beyond just
reading some text?  How important is it?  (There obviously has to
be some mechanism to prevent people from saying everything is
important.)  When does it have to be done?<br><br>This is one of those ideas that&apos;s like an irresistible force meeting
an immovable object.  On one hand, entrenched protocols are impossible
to replace.  On the other, it seems unlikely that people in
100 years will still be living in the same email hell we do now.
And if email is going to get replaced eventually, why not now?<br><br>If you do it right, you may be able to avoid the usual chicken 
and egg problem new protocols face, because some of the most powerful
people in the world will be among the first to switch to it.  
They&apos;re all at the mercy of email too.<br><br>Whatever you build, make it fast.  GMail has become painfully slow.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
If you made something no better than GMail, but fast, that
alone would let you start to pull users away from GMail.<br><br>GMail is slow because Google can&apos;t afford to spend a lot on it.
But people will pay for this.  I&apos;d have no problem paying $50 a month.
Considering how much time I spend in email, it&apos;s kind of scary to
think how much I&apos;d be justified in paying.  At least $1000 a month.
If I spend several hours a day reading and writing email, that would
be a cheap way to make my life better.<br><br><b>3. Replace Universities</b><br><br>People are all over this idea lately, and I think they&apos;re onto
something.  I&apos;m reluctant to suggest that an institution that&apos;s
been around for a millennium is finished just because of some mistakes
they made in the last few decades, but certainly in the last few
decades US universities seem to have been headed down the wrong
path.  One could do a lot better for a lot less money.<br><br>I don&apos;t think universities will disappear.  They won&apos;t be replaced
wholesale.  They&apos;ll just lose the de facto monopoly on certain types
of learning that they once had.  There will be many different ways
to learn different things, and some may look quite different from
universities.   Y Combinator itself is arguably one of them.<br><br>Learning is such a big problem that changing the way people do it
will have a wave of secondary effects.  For example, the name of
the university one went to is treated by a lot of people (correctly
or not) as a credential in its own right.  If learning breaks up
into many little pieces, credentialling may separate from it.  There
may even need to be replacements for campus social life (and oddly
enough, YC even has aspects of that).<br><br>You could replace high schools too, but there you face bureaucratic
obstacles that would slow down a startup.  Universities seem the
place to start.<br><br><b>4. Internet Drama</b><br><br>Hollywood has been slow to embrace the Internet.  That was a 
mistake, because I think we can now call a winner in the race between
delivery mechanisms, and it is the Internet, not cable.<br><br>A lot of the reason is the horribleness of cable clients, also known
as TVs.  Our family didn&apos;t wait for Apple TV.  We hated our last
TV so much that a few months ago we replaced it with an iMac bolted
to the wall.  It&apos;s a little inconvenient to control it with a
wireless mouse, but the overall experience is much better than the
nightmare UI we had to deal with before.<br><br>Some of the attention people currently devote to watching
movies and TV can be stolen by things that seem completely unrelated,
like social networking apps.  More can be stolen by things that are
a little more closely related, like games.  But there will probably
always remain some residual demand for conventional drama, where
you sit passively and watch as a plot happens.  So how do you deliver
drama via the Internet?  Whatever you make will have to be on a
larger scale than Youtube clips.  When people sit down to watch a
show, they want to know what they&apos;re going to get: either part
of a series with familiar characters, or a single longer &quot;movie&quot;
whose basic premise they know in advance.<br><br>There are two ways delivery and payment could play out.  Either
some company like Netflix or Apple will be the app store for
entertainment, and you&apos;ll reach audiences through them.  Or the
would-be app stores will be too overreaching, or too technically
inflexible, and companies will arise to supply payment and streaming
a la carte to the producers of drama.  If that&apos;s the way things
play out, there will also be a need for such infrastructure companies.<br><br><b>5. The Next Steve Jobs</b><br><br>I was talking recently to someone who knew Apple well, and I asked
him if the people now running the company would be able to keep
creating new things the way Apple had under Steve Jobs.  His answer
was simply &quot;no.&quot;  I already feared that would be the answer.  I
asked more to see how he&apos;d qualify it.  But he didn&apos;t qualify it
at all.  No, there will be no more great new stuff beyond whatever&apos;s
currently in the pipeline.  Apple&apos;s
revenues may continue to rise for a long time, but as Microsoft
shows, revenue is a lagging indicator in the technology business.<br><br>So if Apple&apos;s not going to make the next iPad, who is?  None of the
existing players.  None of them are run by product visionaries, and
empirically you can&apos;t seem to get those by hiring them.  Empirically
the way you get a product visionary as CEO is for him to found the
company and not get fired.  So the company that creates the next
wave of hardware is probably going to have to be a startup.<br><br>I realize it sounds preposterously ambitious for a startup to try
to become as big as Apple.  But no more ambitious than it was for
Apple to become as big as Apple, and they did it.  Plus a startup
taking on this problem now has an advantage the original Apple
didn&apos;t: the example of Apple.  Steve Jobs has shown us what&apos;s
possible.  That helps would-be successors both directly, as Roger
Bannister did, by showing how much better you can do than people
did before, and indirectly, as Augustus did, by lodging the idea
in users&apos; minds that a single person could unroll the future 
for them. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Now Steve is gone there&apos;s a vacuum we can all feel.  If a new company
led boldly into the future of hardware, users would follow.  The
CEO of that company, the &quot;next Steve Jobs,&quot; might not measure up
to Steve Jobs. But he wouldn&apos;t have to.  He&apos;d just have to do a
better job than Samsung and HP and Nokia, and that seems pretty
doable.<br><br><b>6. Bring Back Moore&apos;s Law</b><br><br>The last 10 years have reminded us what Moore&apos;s Law actually says.
Till about 2002 you could safely misinterpret it as promising that
clock speeds would double every 18 months.  Actually what it says
is that circuit densities will double every 18 months.  It used to
seem pedantic to point that out.  Not any more.  Intel can no longer
give us faster CPUs, just more of them.<br><br>This Moore&apos;s Law is not as good as the old one.  Moore&apos;s Law used
to mean that if your software was slow, all you had to do was wait,
and the inexorable progress of hardware would solve your problems.
Now if your software is slow you have to rewrite it to do more
things in parallel, which is a lot more work than waiting.<br><br>It would be great if a startup could give us something of the old
Moore&apos;s Law back, by writing software that could make a large number
of CPUs look to the developer like one very fast CPU.  There are
several ways to approach this problem.  The most ambitious is to
try to do it automatically: to write a compiler that will parallelize
our code for us.  There&apos;s a name for this compiler, <i>the sufficiently
smart compiler,</i> and it is a byword for impossibility.  But is
it really impossible?  Is there no configuration of the bits in
memory of a present day computer that is this compiler?  If you
really think so, you should try to prove it, because that would be
an interesting result.  And if it&apos;s not impossible but simply very
hard, it might be worth trying to write it.  The expected value
would be high even if the chance of succeeding was low.<br><br>The reason the expected value is so high is web services.  If you
could write software that gave programmers the convenience of the
way things were in the old days, you could offer it to them as a
web service.  And that would in turn mean that you got practically
all the users.<br><br>Imagine there was another processor manufacturer that could still translate
increased circuit densities into increased clock speeds. They&apos;d
take most of Intel&apos;s business.  And since web services mean that
no one sees their processors anymore, by writing the sufficiently
smart compiler you could create a situation indistinguishable from
you being that manufacturer, at least for the server market.<br><br>The least ambitious way of approaching the problem is to start from
the other end, and offer programmers more parallelizable Lego blocks
to build programs out of, like Hadoop and MapReduce.   Then the
programmer still does much of the work of optimization.<br><br>There&apos;s an intriguing middle ground where you build a semi-automatic
weapon&#x2014;where there&apos;s a human in the loop.  You make something
that looks to the user like the sufficiently smart compiler, but
inside has people, using highly developed optimization tools to
find and eliminate bottlenecks in users&apos; programs.   These people
might be your employees, or you might create a marketplace for
optimization.<br><br>An optimization marketplace would be a way to generate the sufficiently
smart compiler piecemeal, because participants would immediately
start writing bots.  It would be a curious state of affairs if you
could get to the point where everything could be done by bots,
because then you&apos;d have made the sufficiently smart compiler, but
no one person would have a complete copy of it.<br><br>I realize how crazy all this sounds.  In fact, what I like about
this idea is all the different ways in which it&apos;s wrong.  The whole
idea of focusing on optimization is counter to the general trend
in software development for the last several decades.  Trying to
write the sufficiently smart compiler is by definition a mistake.
And even if it weren&apos;t, compilers are the sort of software that&apos;s
supposed to be created by open source projects, not companies.  Plus
if this works it will deprive all the programmers who take pleasure
in making multithreaded apps of so much amusing complexity. The
forum troll I have by now internalized doesn&apos;t even know where to
begin in raising objections to this project.  Now that&apos;s what I
call a startup idea.<br><br><b>7. Ongoing Diagnosis</b><br><br>But wait, here&apos;s another that could face even greater resistance:
ongoing, automatic medical diagnosis.<br><br>One of my tricks for generating startup ideas is to imagine the
ways in which we&apos;ll seem backward to future generations.  And I&apos;m
pretty sure that to people 50 or 100 years in the future, it will
seem barbaric that people in our era waited till they had symptoms
to be diagnosed with conditions like heart disease and cancer.<br><br>For example, in 2004 Bill Clinton found he was feeling short of
breath.  Doctors discovered that several of his arteries were over
90% blocked and 3 days later he had a quadruple bypass.  It seems
reasonable to assume Bill Clinton has the best medical care available.
And yet even he had to wait till his arteries were over 90% blocked
to learn that the number was over 90%.  Surely at some point in the
future we&apos;ll know these numbers the way we now know something like
our weight.  Ditto for cancer.  It will seem preposterous to future
generations that we wait till patients have physical symptoms to
be diagnosed with cancer.  Cancer will show up on some sort of radar
screen immediately.<br><br>(Of course, what shows up on the radar screen may be different from
what we think of now as cancer.  I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if at any
given time we have ten or even hundreds of microcancers going at
once, none of which normally amount to anything.)<br><br>A lot of the obstacles to ongoing diagnosis will come from the fact
that it&apos;s going against the grain of the medical profession.  The
way medicine has always worked is that patients come to doctors
with problems, and the doctors figure out what&apos;s wrong.  A lot of
doctors don&apos;t like the idea of going on the medical equivalent of
what lawyers call a &quot;fishing expedition,&quot; where you go looking for
problems without knowing what you&apos;re looking for.  They call the
things that get discovered this way &quot;incidentalomas,&quot; and they are
something of a nuisance.<br><br>For example, a friend of mine once had her brain scanned as part
of a study.  She was horrified when the doctors running the study
discovered what appeared to be a large tumor.  After further testing,
it turned out to be a harmless cyst.  But it cost her a few days
of terror. A lot of doctors worry that if you start scanning people
with no symptoms, you&apos;ll get this on a giant scale: a huge number
of false alarms that make patients panic and require expensive and
perhaps even dangerous tests to resolve.  But I think that&apos;s just
an artifact of current limitations.  If people were scanned all the
time and we got better at deciding what was a real problem, my
friend would have known about this cyst her whole life and known
it was harmless, just as we do a birthmark.<br><br>There is room for a lot of startups here.  
In addition to the technical obstacles all
startups face, and the bureaucratic obstacles all medical startups
face, they&apos;ll be going against thousands of years of medical
tradition.  But it will happen, and it will be a great thing&#x2014;so
great that people in the future will feel as sorry for us as we do
for the generations that lived before anaesthesia and antibiotics.<br><br><b>Tactics</b><br><br>Let me conclude with some tactical advice.  If you want to take on
a problem as big as the ones I&apos;ve discussed, don&apos;t make a direct
frontal attack on it.  Don&apos;t say, for example, that you&apos;re going
to replace email.  If you do that you raise too many expectations.
Your employees and investors will constantly be asking &quot;are we there
yet?&quot; and you&apos;ll have an army of haters waiting to see you fail.
Just say you&apos;re building todo-list software.  That sounds harmless.
People can notice you&apos;ve replaced email when it&apos;s a <i>fait accompli</i>.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Empirically, the way to do really big things seems to be to start
with deceptively small things.  Want to dominate microcomputer
software?  Start by writing a Basic interpreter for a machine with
a few thousand users.  Want to make the universal web site?  Start
by building a site for Harvard undergrads to stalk one another.<br><br>Empirically, it&apos;s not just for other people that you need to start
small.  You need to for your own sake.  Neither Bill Gates nor Mark
Zuckerberg knew at first how big their companies were going to get.
All they knew was that they were onto something.  Maybe it&apos;s a bad
idea to have really big ambitions initially, because the bigger
your ambition, the longer it&apos;s going to take, and the further you
project into the future, the more likely you&apos;ll get it wrong.<br><br>I think the way to use these big ideas is not to try to identify a
precise point in the future and then ask yourself how to get from
here to there, like the popular image of a visionary.  You&apos;ll be
better off if you operate like Columbus and just head in a general
westerly direction.  Don&apos;t try to construct the future like a
building, because your current blueprint is almost certainly mistaken.
Start with something you know works, and when you expand, expand
westward.<br><br>The popular image of the visionary is someone with a clear view of
the future, but empirically it may be better to have a blurry one.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
It&apos;s also one of the most important things VCs fail to
understand about startups.  Most expect founders to walk in with a
clear plan for the future, and judge them based on that.  Few
consciously realize that in the biggest successes there is the least
correlation between the initial plan and what the startup eventually
becomes.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]

century Japan called Ooka Tadasuke.  One of the cases he decided
was brought by the owner of a food shop.  A poor student who could
afford only rice was eating his rice while enjoying the delicious
cooking smells coming from the food shop.  The owner wanted the
student to pay for the smells he was enjoying.  The student was
stealing his smells!<br><br>This story often comes to mind when I hear the RIAA and MPAA accusing
people of stealing music and movies.<br><br>It sounds ridiculous to us to treat smells as property.  But I can
imagine scenarios in which one could charge for smells.  Imagine
we were living on a moon base where we had to buy air by the
liter.  I could imagine air suppliers adding scents at an extra
charge.<br><br>The reason it seems ridiculous to us to treat smells as property
is that it wouldn&apos;t work to.  It would work on a moon base, though.<br><br>What counts as property depends on what works to treat as property.
And that not only can change, but has changed.  Humans may always
(for some definition of human and always) have treated small items
carried on one&apos;s person as property.  But hunter gatherers didn&apos;t
treat land, for example, as property in the way we do.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The reason so many people think of property as having a single
unchanging definition is that its definition changes very slowly.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
But we are in the midst of such a change now.  The record
labels and movie studios used to distribute what they made like air
shipped through tubes on a moon base.  But with the arrival of
networks, it&apos;s as if we&apos;ve moved to a planet with a breathable
atmosphere.  Data moves like smells now.  And through a combination
of wishful thinking and short-term greed, the labels and studios
have put themselves in the position of the food shop owner, accusing
us all of stealing their smells.<br><br>(The reason I say short-term greed is that the underlying problem
with the labels and studios is that the people who run them are
driven by bonuses rather than equity.  If they were driven by equity
they&apos;d be looking for ways to take advantage of technological change
instead of fighting it.  But building new things takes too long.
Their bonuses depend on this year&apos;s revenues, and the best way to
increase those is to extract more money from stuff they do already.)<br><br>So what does this mean?  Should people not be able to charge for
content?  There&apos;s not a single yes or no answer to that question.
People should be able to charge for content when it works to charge
for content.<br><br>But by &quot;works&quot; I mean something more subtle than &quot;when they can get
away with it.&quot;  I mean when people can charge for content without
warping society in order to do it.  After all, the companies selling
smells on the moon base could continue to sell them on the Earth,
if they lobbied successfully for laws requiring us all to continue
to breathe through tubes down here too, even though we no longer
needed to.<br><br>The crazy legal measures that the labels and studios have been
taking have a lot of that flavor.  Newspapers and magazines are
just as screwed, but they are at least declining gracefully.  The
RIAA and MPAA would make us breathe through tubes if they could.<br><br>Ultimately it comes down to common sense.  When you&apos;re abusing the
legal system by trying to use mass lawsuits against randomly chosen
people as a form of exemplary punishment, or lobbying for laws
that would break the Internet if they passed, that&apos;s ipso facto
evidence you&apos;re using a definition of property that doesn&apos;t work.<br><br>This is where it&apos;s helpful to have working democracies and multiple
sovereign countries.  If the world had a single, autocratic government,
the labels and studios could buy laws making the definition of
property be whatever they wanted.  But fortunately there are still
some countries that are not copyright colonies of the US, and even
in the US, <a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/congress-on-sopa-done.png">politicians</a>
still seem to be afraid of actual voters, in sufficient numbers.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The people running the US may not like it when voters or other
countries refuse to bend to their will, but ultimately it&apos;s in all
our interest that there&apos;s not a single point of attack for people
trying to warp the law to serve their own purposes.  Private property
is an extremely useful idea&#x2014;arguably one of our greatest inventions.
So far, each new definition of it has brought us increasing material
wealth.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
It seems reasonable to suppose the newest one will
too.  It would be a disaster if we all had to keep running an
obsolete version just because a few powerful people were too lazy
to upgrade.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
If you want to learn more about hunter gatherers I strongly
recommend Elizabeth Marshall Thomas&apos;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harmless-People-Elizabeth-Marshall-Thomas/dp/0394427793"><i>The
Harmless People</i></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Old-Way-Story-First-People/dp/0374225524"><i>The
Old Way</i></a>.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Change in the definition of property is driven mostly by
technological progress, however, and since technological progress
is accelerating, so presumably will the rate of change in the
definition of property.  Which means it&apos;s all the more important
for societies to be able to respond gracefully to such changes,
because they will come at an ever increasing rate.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
As far as I know, the term &quot;copyright colony&quot; was first used
by <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/australia-us-copyright-colony-or-just-a-good-friend-120121/">Myles
Peterson</a>.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
The state of technology isn&apos;t simply a function of
the definition of property.  They each constrain the other.  But
that being so, you can&apos;t mess with the definition of property without
affecting (and probably harming) the state of technology.  The
history of the USSR offers a vivid illustration of that.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts

I say &quot;um&quot; a lot. Sometimes I have
to pause when I lose my train of thought.  I wish I were a better
speaker.  But I don&apos;t wish I were a better speaker like I wish I
were a better writer.  What I really want is to have good ideas,
and that&apos;s a much bigger part of being a good writer than being a
good speaker.<br><br>Having good ideas is most of writing well.  If you know what you&apos;re
talking about, you can say it in the plainest words and you&apos;ll be
perceived as having a good style.  With speaking it&apos;s the opposite:
having good ideas is an alarmingly small component of being a good
speaker.<br><br>I first noticed this at a conference several years ago.
There was another speaker who was much better than me.
He had all of us roaring with laughter.  I seemed awkward and
halting by comparison.  Afterward I put my talk online like I usually
do.  As I was doing it I tried to imagine what a transcript of the
other guy&apos;s talk would be like, and it was only then I realized he
hadn&apos;t said very much.<br><br>Maybe this would have been obvious to someone who knew more about
speaking, but it was a revelation to me how much less ideas mattered
in speaking than writing.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>A few years later I heard a talk by someone who was not merely a
better speaker than me, but a famous speaker.  Boy was he good.  So
I decided I&apos;d pay close attention to what he said, to learn how he
did it.  After about ten sentences I found myself thinking &quot;I don&apos;t
want to be a good speaker.&quot;<br><br>Being a really good speaker is not merely orthogonal to having good ideas,
but in many ways pushes you in the opposite direction.  For example,
when I give a talk I usually write it out beforehand.  I know that&apos;s
a mistake; I know delivering a 
<nota href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc">prewritten 
talk makes it harder to
engage with an audience.  The way to get the attention of an audience
is to give them <i>your</i> full attention, and when you&apos;re delivering
a prewritten talk your attention is always divided between the
audience and the talk&#x2014;even if you&apos;ve memorized it.  If you want
to engage an audience it&apos;s better to start with no more than an outline
of what you want to say and 
<nota href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmG9jzCHtSQ">ad lib the individual sentences.  But
if you do that you could spend no more time thinking about each
sentence than it takes to say it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Occasionally the stimulation
of talking to a live audience makes you think of new things, but
in general this is not going to generate ideas as well as writing
does, where you can spend as long on each sentence as you want.<br><br>If you rehearse a prewritten speech enough, you can get
asymptotically close to the sort of engagement you get when speaking
ad lib.  Actors do.  But here again there&apos;s a tradeoff between
smoothness and ideas.  All the time you spend practicing a talk,
you could instead spend making it better.  Actors don&apos;t face
that temptation except in the rare cases where they&apos;ve written the
script, but any speaker does.  Before I give a talk I can usually
be found sitting in a corner somewhere with a copy printed out on
paper, trying to rehearse it in my head.  But I always end up
spending most of the time rewriting it instead.  Every talk I give
ends up being given from a manuscript full of things crossed out
and rewritten.  Which of course makes me um even more, because I
haven&apos;t had any time at all to practice the new bits.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Depending on your audience, there are even worse tradeoffs than
these.  Audiences like to be flattered; they like jokes; they like
to be swept off their feet by a vigorous stream of words.  As you
decrease the intelligence of the audience, being a good speaker is
increasingly a matter of being a good bullshitter.  That&apos;s true in
writing too of course, but the descent is steeper with talks.  Any
given person is dumber as a member of an audience than as a reader.
Just as a speaker ad libbing can only spend as long thinking about
each sentence as it takes to say it, a person hearing a talk can
only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to hear
it.  Plus people in an audience are always affected by the reactions
of those around them, and the reactions that spread from person to
person in an audience are disproportionately the more brutish sort,
just as low notes travel through walls better than high ones.  Every
audience is an incipient mob, and a good speaker uses that.  Part
of the reason I laughed so much at the talk by the good speaker at
that conference was that everyone else did.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>So are talks useless?  They&apos;re certainly inferior to the written
word as a source of ideas.  But that&apos;s not all talks are good for.
When I go to a talk, it&apos;s usually because I&apos;m interested in the
speaker.  Listening to a talk is the closest most of us can get to
having a conversation with someone like the president, who doesn&apos;t
have time to meet individually with all the people who want to meet
him.<br><br>Talks are also good at motivating me to do things.  It&apos;s probably
no coincidence that so many famous speakers are described as
motivational speakers.  That may be what public speaking is really
for.  It&apos;s probably what it was originally for.  The emotional
reactions you can elicit with a talk can be a powerful force.
I wish I could say that force was more often used for good than
ill, but I&apos;m not sure.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I&apos;m not talking here about academic talks, which are a 
different type of thing.  While the
audience at an academic talk might appreciate a joke, they will (or
at least should) make a conscious effort to see what new ideas
you&apos;re presenting.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
That&apos;s the lower bound.  In practice you can often do better,
because talks are usually about things you&apos;ve written or talked
about before, and when you ad lib you end up reproducing some of
those sentences.  Like early medieval architecture, impromptu talks
are made of spolia.  Which feels a bit dishonest, incidentally,
because you have to deliver these sentences as if you&apos;d just thought
of them.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Robert Morris points out that there is a way in which practicing
talks makes them better: reading a talk out loud can expose awkward
parts.  I agree and in fact I read most things I write out loud at
least once for that reason.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
For sufficiently small audiences, it may not be true that being
part of an audience makes people dumber.  The real decline seems
to set in when the audience gets too big for the talk to feel like
a conversation&#x2014;maybe around 10 people.<br><br>

<p>
September 2012<br><br>I&apos;ve done several types of work over the years but I don&apos;t know
another as counterintuitive as startup investing.<br><br>The two most important things to understand about startup investing,
as a business, are (1) that effectively all the returns are
concentrated in a few big winners, and (2) that the best ideas look
initially like bad ideas.<br><br>The first rule I knew intellectually, but didn&apos;t really grasp till
it happened to us.  The total value of the companies we&apos;ve funded
is around 10 billion, give or take a few.  But just two companies,
Dropbox and Airbnb, account for about three quarters of it.<br><br>In startups, the big winners are big to a degree that violates our
expectations about variation.  I don&apos;t know whether these expectations
are innate or learned, but whatever the cause, we are just not
prepared for the 1000x variation in outcomes that one finds in
startup investing.<br><br>That yields all sorts of strange consequences.  For example, in
purely financial terms, there is probably at most one company in
each YC batch that will have a significant effect on our returns,
and the rest are just a cost of doing business.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
I haven&apos;t
really assimilated that fact, partly because it&apos;s so counterintuitive,
and partly because we&apos;re not doing this just for financial reasons;
YC would be a pretty lonely place if we only had one company per
batch.  And yet it&apos;s true.<br><br>To succeed in a domain that violates your intuitions, you need to
be able to turn them off the way a pilot does when flying through
clouds. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
  You need to do what you know intellectually to be
right, even though it feels wrong.<br><br>It&apos;s a constant battle for us.  It&apos;s hard to make ourselves take
enough risks. When you interview a startup and think &quot;they seem
likely to succeed,&quot; it&apos;s hard not to fund them.  And yet, financially
at least, there is only one kind of success: they&apos;re either going
to be one of the really big winners or not, and if not it doesn&apos;t
matter whether you fund them, because even if they succeed the
effect on your returns will be insignificant.  In the same day of
interviews you might meet some smart 19 year olds who aren&apos;t even
sure what they want to work on. Their chances of succeeding seem
small.  But again, it&apos;s not their chances of succeeding that matter
but their chances of succeeding really big.  The probability that
any group will succeed really big is microscopically small, but the
probability that those 19 year olds will might be higher than that
of the other, safer group.<br><br>The probability that a startup will make it big is not simply a
constant fraction of the probability that they will succeed at all.
If it were, you could fund everyone who seemed likely to succeed
at all, and you&apos;d get that fraction of big hits.  Unfortunately
picking winners is harder than that.  You have to ignore the elephant
in front of you, the likelihood they&apos;ll succeed, and focus instead
on the separate and almost invisibly intangible question of whether
they&apos;ll succeed really big.<br><br><b>Harder</b><br><br>That&apos;s made harder by the fact that the best startup ideas seem at
first like bad ideas.  I&apos;ve written about this before: if a good
idea were obviously good, someone else would already have done it.
So the most successful founders tend to work on ideas that few
beside them realize are good.  Which is not that far from a description
of insanity, till you reach the point where you see results.<br><br>The first time Peter Thiel spoke at YC he drew a Venn diagram that
illustrates the situation perfectly.  He drew two intersecting
circles, one labelled &quot;seems like a bad idea&quot; and the other &quot;is a
good idea.&quot;  The intersection is the sweet spot for startups.<br><br>This concept is a simple one and yet seeing it as a Venn diagram
is illuminating.  It reminds you that there is an intersection&#x2014;that
there are good ideas that seem bad.  It also reminds you that the
vast majority of ideas that seem bad are bad.<br><br>The fact that the best ideas seem like bad ideas makes it even
harder to recognize the big winners.  It means the probability of
a startup making it really big is not merely not a constant fraction
of the probability that it will succeed, but that the startups with
a high probability of the former will seem to have a disproportionately
low probability of the latter.<br><br>History tends to get rewritten by big successes, so that in retrospect
it seems obvious they were going to make it big.  For that reason
one of my most valuable memories is how lame Facebook sounded to
me when I first heard about it.  A site for college students to
waste time?  It seemed the perfect bad idea: a site (1) for a niche
market (2) with no money (3) to do something that didn&apos;t matter.<br><br>One could have described Microsoft and Apple in exactly the same
terms.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Harder Still</b><br><br>Wait, it gets worse.  You not only have to solve this hard problem,
but you have to do it with no indication of whether you&apos;re succeeding.
When you pick a big winner, you won&apos;t know it for two years.<br><br>Meanwhile, the one thing you <i>can</i> measure is dangerously
misleading.  The one thing we can track precisely is how well the
startups in each batch do at fundraising after Demo Day.  But we
know that&apos;s the wrong metric.  There&apos;s no correlation between the
percentage of startups that raise money and the metric that does
matter financially, whether that batch of startups contains a big
winner or not.<br><br>Except an inverse one.  That&apos;s the scary thing: fundraising is not
merely a useless metric, but positively misleading.  We&apos;re in a
business where we need to pick unpromising-looking outliers, and
the huge scale of the successes means we can afford to spread our
net very widely.  The big winners could generate 10,000x returns.
That means for each big winner we could pick a thousand companies
that returned nothing and still end up 10x ahead.<br><br>If we ever got to the point where 100% of the startups we funded
were able to raise money after Demo Day, it would almost certainly
mean we were being too conservative.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>It takes a conscious effort not to do that too.  After 15 cycles
of preparing startups for investors and then watching how they do,
I can now look at a group we&apos;re interviewing through Demo Day
investors&apos; eyes.  But those are the wrong eyes to look through!<br><br>We can afford to take at least 10x as much risk as Demo Day investors.
And since risk is usually proportionate to reward, if you can afford
to take more risk you should.  What would it mean to take 10x more
risk than Demo Day investors?  We&apos;d have to be willing to fund 10x
more startups than they would.  Which means that even if we&apos;re
generous to ourselves and assume that YC can on average triple a
startup&apos;s expected value, we&apos;d be taking the right amount of risk
if only 30% of the startups were able to raise significant funding
after Demo Day.<br><br>I don&apos;t know what fraction of them currently raise more after Demo
Day.  I deliberately avoid calculating that number, because if you
start measuring something you start optimizing it, and I know it&apos;s
the wrong thing to optimize.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
But the percentage is certainly
way over 30%.  And frankly the thought of a 30% success rate at
fundraising makes my stomach clench.  A Demo Day where only 30% of
the startups were fundable would be a shambles.  Everyone would
agree that YC had jumped the shark. We ourselves would feel that
YC had jumped the shark.  And yet we&apos;d all be wrong.<br><br>For better or worse that&apos;s never going to be more than a thought
experiment.  We could never stand it.  How about that for
counterintuitive?  I can lay out what I know to be the right thing
to do, and still not do it.  I can make up all sorts of plausible
justifications.  It would hurt YC&apos;s brand (at least among the
innumerate) if we invested in huge numbers of risky startups that
flamed out.  It might dilute the value of the alumni network.
Perhaps most convincingly, it would be demoralizing for us to be
up to our chins in failure all the time.  But I know the real reason
we&apos;re so conservative is that we just haven&apos;t assimilated the fact
of 1000x variation in returns.<br><br>We&apos;ll probably never be able to bring ourselves to take risks
proportionate to the returns in this business.  The best we can
hope for is that when we interview a group and find ourselves
thinking &quot;they seem like good founders, but what are investors going
to think of this crazy idea?&quot; we&apos;ll continue to be able to say &quot;who
cares what investors think?&quot;  That&apos;s what we thought about Airbnb,
and if we want to fund more Airbnbs we have to stay good at thinking
it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I&apos;m not saying that the big winners are all that matters, just
that they&apos;re all that matters financially for investors.  Since
we&apos;re not doing YC mainly for financial reasons, the big winners
aren&apos;t all that matters to us.  We&apos;re delighted to have funded
Reddit, for example. Even though we made comparatively little from
it, Reddit has had a big effect on the world, and it introduced us
to Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, both of whom have become good
friends.<br><br>Nor do we push founders to try to become one of the big winners if
they don&apos;t want to. We didn&apos;t &quot;swing for the fences&quot; in our own
startup (Viaweb, which was acquired for $50 million), and it would
feel pretty bogus to press founders to do something we didn&apos;t do.
Our rule is that it&apos;s up to the founders.  Some want to take over
the world, and some just want that first few million.  But we invest
in so many companies that we don&apos;t have to sweat any one outcome.
In fact, we don&apos;t have to sweat whether startups have exits at all.
The biggest exits are the only ones that matter financially, and
those are guaranteed in the sense that if a company becomes big
enough, a market for its shares will inevitably arise.  Since the
remaining outcomes don&apos;t have a significant effect on returns, it&apos;s
cool with us if the founders want to sell early for a small amount,
or grow slowly and never sell (i.e. become a so-called lifestyle
business), or even shut the company down.  We&apos;re sometimes disappointed
when a startup we had high hopes for doesn&apos;t do well, but this
disappointment is mostly the ordinary variety that anyone feels
when that happens.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Without visual cues (e.g. the horizon) you can&apos;t distinguish
between gravity and acceleration.  Which means if you&apos;re flying
through clouds you can&apos;t tell what the attitude of
the aircraft is.  You could feel like you&apos;re flying straight and
level while in fact you&apos;re descending in a spiral.  The solution
is to ignore what your body is telling you and listen only to your
instruments.  But it turns out to be very hard to ignore what your
body is telling you.  Every pilot knows about this 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation">problem</a> and yet
it is still a leading cause of accidents.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Not all big hits follow this pattern though. The reason Google
seemed a bad idea was that there were already lots of search engines
and there didn&apos;t seem to be room for another.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
A startup&apos;s success at fundraising is a function of two things:
what they&apos;re selling and how good they are at selling it.  And while
we can teach startups a lot about how to appeal to investors, even
the most convincing pitch can&apos;t sell an idea that investors don&apos;t
like.  I was genuinely worried that Airbnb, for example, would not
be able to raise money after Demo Day.  I couldn&apos;t convince <a href="airbnb.html">Fred Wilson</a> to fund them.  They might not
have raised money at all but for the coincidence that Greg Mcadoo,
our contact at Sequoia, was one of a handful of VCs who understood
the vacation rental business, having spent much of the previous two
years investigating it.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
I calculated it once for the last batch before a consortium of
investors started offering investment automatically to every startup
we funded, summer 2010.  At the time it was 94% (33 of 35 companies
that tried to raise money succeeded, and one didn&apos;t try because
they were already profitable).  Presumably it&apos;s lower now because
of that investment; in the old days it was raise after Demo Day or
die.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, Jessica

<p>
September 2012<br><br>A startup is a company designed to grow fast.  Being newly founded
does not in itself make a company a startup.  Nor is it necessary
for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or
have some sort of &quot;exit.&quot;  The only essential thing is growth.
Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.<br><br>If you want to start one it&apos;s important to understand that. Startups
are so hard that you can&apos;t be pointed off to the side and hope to
succeed.  You have to know that growth is what you&apos;re after.  The
good news is, if you get growth, everything else tends to fall into
place.  Which means you can use growth like a compass to make almost
every decision you face.<br><br>
<b>Redwoods</b><br><br>Let&apos;s start with a distinction that should be obvious but is often
overlooked: not every newly founded company is a startup.  Millions
of companies are started every year in the US.  Only a tiny fraction
are startups.  Most are service businesses&#x2014;restaurants, barbershops,
plumbers, and so on.  These are not startups, except in a few unusual
cases.  A barbershop isn&apos;t designed to grow fast.  Whereas a search
engine, for example, is.<br><br>When I say startups are designed to grow fast, I mean it in two
senses.  Partly I mean designed in the sense of intended, because
most startups fail.  But I also mean startups are different by
nature, in the same way a redwood seedling has a different destiny
from a bean sprout.<br><br>That difference is why there&apos;s a distinct word, &quot;startup,&quot; for
companies designed to grow fast.  If all companies were essentially
similar, but some through luck or the efforts of their founders
ended up growing very fast, we wouldn&apos;t need a separate word.  We
could just talk about super-successful companies and less successful
ones.  But in fact startups do have a different sort of DNA from
other businesses.  Google is not just a barbershop whose founders
were unusually lucky and hard-working.  Google was different from
the beginning.<br><br>To grow rapidly, you need to make something you can sell to a big
market.  That&apos;s the difference between Google and a barbershop.  A
barbershop doesn&apos;t scale.<br><br>For a company to grow really big, it must (a) make something lots
of people want, and (b) reach and serve all those people.  Barbershops
are doing fine in the (a) department.  Almost everyone needs their
hair cut.  The problem for a barbershop, as for any retail
establishment, is (b).  A barbershop serves customers in person,
and few will travel far for a haircut.  And even if they did the
barbershop couldn&apos;t accomodate them. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>
Writing software is a great way to solve (b), but you can still end
up constrained in (a).  If you write software to teach Tibetan to
Hungarian speakers, you&apos;ll be able to reach most of the people who
want it, but there won&apos;t be many of them.   If you make software
to teach English to Chinese speakers, however, you&apos;re in startup
territory.<br><br>Most businesses are tightly constrained in (a) or (b).  The distinctive
feature of successful startups is that they&apos;re not.<br><br>
<b>Ideas</b><br><br>It might seem that it would always be better to start a startup
than an ordinary business.  If you&apos;re going to start a company, why
not start the type with the most potential?  The catch is that this
is a (fairly) efficient market.   If you write software to teach
Tibetan to Hungarians, you won&apos;t have much competition.  If you
write software to teach English to Chinese speakers, you&apos;ll face
ferocious competition, precisely because that&apos;s such a larger prize.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The constraints that limit ordinary companies also protect them.
That&apos;s the tradeoff.  If you start a barbershop, you only have to
compete with other local barbers.  If you start a search engine you
have to compete with the whole world.<br><br>The most important thing that the constraints on a normal business
protect it from is not competition, however, but the difficulty of
coming up with new ideas.  If you open a bar in a particular
neighborhood, as well as limiting your potential and protecting you
from competitors, that geographic constraint also helps define your
company.  Bar + neighborhood is a sufficient idea for a small
business.  Similarly for companies constrained in (a).  Your niche
both protects and defines you.<br><br>Whereas if you want to start a startup, you&apos;re probably going to
have to think of something fairly novel.  A startup has to make
something it can deliver to a large market, and ideas of that type
are so valuable that all the obvious ones are already taken.<br><br>That space of ideas has been so thoroughly picked over that a startup
generally has to work on something everyone else has overlooked.
I was going to write that one has to make a conscious effort to
find ideas everyone else has overlooked.  But that&apos;s not how most
startups get started.  Usually successful startups happen because
the founders are sufficiently different from other people that ideas
few others can see seem obvious to them.  Perhaps later they step
back and notice they&apos;ve found an idea in everyone else&apos;s blind spot,
and from that point make a deliberate effort to stay there. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
But at the moment when successful startups get started, much of the
innovation is unconscious.<br><br>What&apos;s different about successful founders is that they can see
different problems.  It&apos;s a particularly good combination both to
be good at technology and to face problems that can be solved by
it, because technology changes so rapidly that formerly bad ideas
often become good without anyone noticing.  Steve Wozniak&apos;s problem
was that he wanted his own computer.  That was an unusual problem
to have in 1975.  But technological change was about to make it a
much more common one.  Because he not only wanted a computer but
knew how to build them, Wozniak was able to make himself one.  And
the problem he solved for himself became one that Apple solved for
millions of people in the coming years.  But by the time it was
obvious to ordinary people that this was a big market, Apple was
already established.<br><br>Google has similar origins.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted to
search the web.  But unlike most people they had the technical
expertise both to notice that existing search engines were not as
good as they could be, and to know how to improve them.  Over the
next few years their problem became everyone&apos;s problem, as the web
grew to a size where you didn&apos;t have to be a picky search expert
to notice the old algorithms weren&apos;t good enough.  But as happened
with Apple, by the time everyone else realized how important search
was, Google was entrenched.<br><br>That&apos;s one connection between startup ideas and technology.  Rapid
change in one area uncovers big, soluble problems in other areas.
Sometimes the changes are advances, and what they change is solubility.
That was the kind of change that yielded Apple; advances in chip
technology finally let Steve Wozniak design a computer he could
afford.  But in Google&apos;s case the most important change was the
growth of the web. What changed there was not solubility but bigness.<br><br>The other connection between startups and technology is that startups
create new ways of doing things, and new ways of doing things are,
in the broader sense of the word, new technology.  
When a startup both begins with an
idea exposed by technological change and makes a product consisting
of technology in the narrower sense (what used to be called &quot;high
technology&quot;), it&apos;s easy to conflate the two.  But the two connections
are distinct and in principle one could start a startup that was
neither driven by technological change, nor whose product consisted
of technology except in the broader sense. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Rate</b><br><br>How fast does a company have to grow to be considered a startup?
There&apos;s no precise answer to that.  &quot;Startup&quot; is a pole, not a
threshold.  Starting one is at first no more than a declaration of
one&apos;s ambitions.  You&apos;re committing not just to starting a company,
but to starting a fast growing one, and you&apos;re thus committing to
search for one of the rare ideas of that type.  But at first you
have no more than commitment.  Starting a startup is like being an
actor in that respect.  &quot;Actor&quot; too is a pole rather than a threshold.
At the beginning of his career, an actor is a waiter who goes to
auditions.  Getting work makes him a successful actor, but he doesn&apos;t
only become an actor when he&apos;s successful.<br><br>So the real question is not what growth rate makes a company a
startup, but what growth rate successful startups tend to have.
For founders that&apos;s more than a theoretical question, because it&apos;s
equivalent to asking if they&apos;re on the right path.<br><br>The growth of a successful startup usually has three phases:
<ol>
<li> There&apos;s an initial period of slow or no growth while the startup
  tries to figure out what it&apos;s doing.<br><br></li><li> As the startup figures out how to make something lots of people
  want and how to reach those people, there&apos;s a period of rapid
  growth.<br><br></li><li> Eventually a successful startup will grow into a big company.
  Growth will slow, partly due to internal limits and partly because
  the company is starting to bump up against the limits of the
  markets it serves.  
  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
</li></ol>
Together these three phases produce an S-curve.  The phase whose
growth defines the startup is the second one, the ascent.  Its
length and slope determine how big the company will be.<br><br>The slope is the company&apos;s growth rate.  If there&apos;s one number every
founder should always know, it&apos;s the company&apos;s growth rate.  That&apos;s
the measure of a startup.  If you don&apos;t know that number, you don&apos;t
even know if you&apos;re doing well or badly.<br><br>When I first meet founders and ask what their growth rate is,
sometimes they tell me &quot;we get about a hundred new customers a
month.&quot;  That&apos;s not a rate.  What matters is not the absolute number
of new customers, but the ratio of new customers to existing ones.
If you&apos;re really getting a constant number of new customers every
month, you&apos;re in trouble, because that means your growth rate is
decreasing.<br><br>During Y Combinator we measure growth rate per week, partly because
there is so little time before Demo Day, and partly because startups
early on need frequent feedback from their users to tweak what
they&apos;re doing. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>A good growth rate during YC is 5-7% a week.  If you can hit 10% a
week you&apos;re doing exceptionally well.  If you can only manage 1%,
it&apos;s a sign you haven&apos;t yet figured out what you&apos;re doing.<br><br>The best thing to measure the growth rate of is revenue.  The next
best, for startups that aren&apos;t charging initially, is active users.
That&apos;s a reasonable proxy for revenue growth because whenever the
startup does start trying to make money, their revenues will probably
be a constant multiple of active users. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Compass</b><br><br>We usually advise startups to pick a growth rate they think they
can hit, and then just try to hit it every week.  The key word here
is &quot;just.&quot; If they decide to grow at 7% a week and they hit that
number, they&apos;re successful for that week.  There&apos;s nothing more
they need to do.  But if they don&apos;t hit it, they&apos;ve failed in the
only thing that mattered, and should be correspondingly alarmed.<br><br>Programmers will recognize what we&apos;re doing here.  We&apos;re turning
starting a startup into an optimization problem.  And anyone who
has tried optimizing code knows how wonderfully effective that sort
of narrow focus can be.  Optimizing code means taking an existing
program and changing it to use less of something, usually time or
memory.  You don&apos;t have to think about what the program should do,
just make it faster.  For most programmers this is very satisfying
work.  The narrow focus makes it a sort of puzzle, and you&apos;re
generally surprised how fast you can solve it.<br><br>Focusing on hitting a growth rate reduces the otherwise bewilderingly
multifarious problem of starting a startup to a single problem.
You can use that target growth rate to make all your decisions for
you; anything that gets you the growth you need is ipso facto right.
Should you spend two days at a conference?  Should you hire another
programmer?  Should you focus more on marketing?  Should you spend
time courting some big customer?  Should you add x feature? Whatever
gets you your target growth rate. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>Judging yourself by weekly growth doesn&apos;t mean you can look no more
than a week ahead.  Once you experience the pain of missing your
target one week (it was the only thing that mattered, and you failed
at it), you become interested in anything that could spare you such
pain in the future.  So you&apos;ll be willing for example to hire another
programmer, who won&apos;t contribute to this week&apos;s growth but perhaps
in a month will have implemented some new feature that will get you
more users.   But only if (a) the distraction of hiring someone
won&apos;t make you miss your numbers in the short term, and (b) you&apos;re
sufficiently worried about whether you can keep hitting your numbers
without hiring someone new.<br><br>It&apos;s not that you don&apos;t think about the future, just that you think
about it no more than necessary.<br><br>In theory this sort of hill-climbing could get a startup into
trouble.  They could end up on a local maximum.  But in practice
that never happens.  Having to hit a growth number every week forces
founders to act, and acting versus not acting is the high bit of
succeeding.  Nine times out of ten, sitting around strategizing is
just a form of procrastination.  Whereas founders&apos; intuitions about
which hill to climb are usually better than they realize.  Plus the
maxima in the space of startup ideas are not spiky and isolated.
Most fairly good ideas are adjacent to even better ones.<br><br>The fascinating thing about optimizing for growth is that it can
actually discover startup ideas.  You can use the need for growth
as a form of evolutionary pressure.  If you start out with some
initial plan and modify it as necessary to keep hitting, say, 10%
weekly growth, you may end up with a quite different company than
you meant to start.  But anything that grows consistently at 10% a
week is almost certainly a better idea than you started with.<br><br>There&apos;s a parallel here to small businesses.  Just as the constraint
of being located in a particular neighborhood helps define a bar,
the constraint of growing at a certain rate can help define a
startup.<br><br>You&apos;ll generally do best to follow that constraint wherever it leads
rather than being influenced by some initial vision, just as a
scientist is better off following the truth wherever it leads rather
than being influenced by what he wishes were the case.  When Richard
Feynman said that the imagination of nature was greater than the
imagination of man, he meant that if you just keep following the
truth you&apos;ll discover cooler things than you could ever have made
up. For startups, growth is a constraint much like truth. Every
successful startup is at least partly a product of the imagination
of growth.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Value</b><br><br>It&apos;s hard to find something that grows consistently at several
percent a week, but if you do you may have found something surprisingly
valuable.  If we project forward we see why.<br><br><center>

A company that grows at 1% a week will grow 1.7x a year, whereas a
company that grows at 5% a week will grow 12.6x.  A company making
$1000 a month (a typical number early in YC) and growing at 1% a
week will 4 years later be making $7900 a month, which is less than
a good programmer makes in salary in Silicon Valley.  A startup
that grows at 5% a week will in 4 years be making $25 million a
month. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>Our ancestors must rarely have encountered cases of exponential
growth, because our intutitions are no guide here.  What happens
to fast growing startups tends to surprise even the founders.<br><br>Small variations in growth rate produce qualitatively different
outcomes.  That&apos;s why there&apos;s a separate word for startups, and why
startups do things that ordinary companies don&apos;t, like raising money
and getting acquired.  And, strangely enough, it&apos;s also why they
fail so frequently.<br><br>Considering how valuable a successful startup can become, anyone
familiar with the concept of expected value would be surprised if
the failure rate weren&apos;t high.  If a successful startup could make
a founder $100 million, then even if the chance of succeeding were
only 1%, the expected value of starting one would be $1 million.
And the probability of a group of sufficiently smart and determined
founders succeeding on that scale might be significantly over 1%.
For the right people&#x2014;e.g. the young Bill Gates&#x2014;the probability
might be 20% or even 50%.  So it&apos;s not surprising that so many want
to take a shot at it.  In an efficient market, the number of failed
startups should be proportionate to the size of the successes.  And
since the latter is huge the former should be too. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>What this means is that at any given time, the great majority of
startups will be working on something that&apos;s never going to go
anywhere, and yet glorifying their doomed efforts with the grandiose
title of &quot;startup.&quot;<br><br>This doesn&apos;t bother me.  It&apos;s the same with other high-beta vocations,
like being an actor or a novelist.  I&apos;ve long since gotten used to
it.  But it seems to bother a lot of people, particularly those
who&apos;ve started ordinary businesses.  Many are annoyed that these
so-called startups get all the attention, when hardly any of them
will amount to anything.<br><br>If they stepped back and looked at the whole picture they might be
less indignant.  The mistake they&apos;re making is that by basing their
opinions on anecdotal evidence they&apos;re implicitly judging by the
median rather than the average.  If you judge by the median startup,
the whole concept of a startup seems like a fraud.  You have to
invent a bubble to explain why founders want to start them or
investors want to fund them.  But it&apos;s a mistake to use the median
in a domain with so much variation.  If you look at the average
outcome rather than the median, you can understand why investors
like them, and why, if they aren&apos;t median people, it&apos;s a rational
choice for founders to start them.<br><br>
<b>Deals</b><br><br>Why do investors like startups so much?  Why are they so hot to
invest in photo-sharing apps, rather than solid money-making
businesses?  Not only for the obvious reason.<br><br>The test of any investment is the ratio of return to risk.  Startups
pass that test because although they&apos;re appallingly risky, the
returns when they do succeed are so high.  But that&apos;s not the only
reason investors like startups.  An ordinary slower-growing business
might have just as good a ratio of return to risk, if both were
lower.  So why are VCs interested only in high-growth companies?
The reason is that they get paid by getting their capital back,
ideally after the startup IPOs, or failing that when it&apos;s acquired.<br><br>The other way to get returns from an investment is in the form of
dividends.  Why isn&apos;t there a parallel VC industry that invests in
ordinary companies in return for a percentage of their profits?
Because it&apos;s too easy for people who control a private company to
funnel its revenues to themselves (e.g. by buying overpriced
components from a supplier they control) while making it look like
the company is making little profit.  Anyone who invested in private
companies in return for dividends would have to pay close attention
to their books.<br><br>The reason VCs like to invest in startups is not simply the returns,
but also because such investments are so easy to oversee.  The
founders can&apos;t enrich themselves without also enriching the investors.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>Why do founders want to take the VCs&apos; money?  Growth, again.  The
constraint between good ideas and growth operates in both directions.
It&apos;s not merely that you need a scalable idea to grow.  If you have
such an idea and don&apos;t grow fast enough, competitors will.  Growing
too slowly is particularly dangerous in a business with network
effects, which the best startups usually have to some degree.<br><br>Almost every company needs some amount of funding to get started.
But startups often raise money even when they are or could be
profitable.  It might seem foolish to sell stock in a profitable
company for less than you think it will later be worth, but it&apos;s
no more foolish than buying insurance.  Fundamentally that&apos;s how
the most successful startups view fundraising.  They could grow the
company on its own revenues, but the extra money and help supplied
by VCs will let them grow even faster.  Raising money lets you
<i>choose</i> your growth rate.<br><br>Money to grow faster is always at the command of the most successful
startups, because the VCs need them more than they need the VCs.
A profitable startup could if it wanted just grow on its own revenues.
Growing slower might be slightly dangerous, but chances are it
wouldn&apos;t kill them.  Whereas VCs need to invest in startups, and
in particular the most successful startups, or they&apos;ll be out of
business.  Which means that any sufficiently promising startup will
be offered money on terms they&apos;d be crazy to refuse.  And yet because
of the scale of the successes in the startup business, VCs can still
make money from such investments.  You&apos;d have to be crazy to believe
your company was going to become as valuable as a high growth rate
can make it, but some do.<br><br>Pretty much every successful startup will get acquisition offers
too.  Why?  What is it about startups that makes other companies
want to buy them? 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>Fundamentally the same thing that makes everyone else want the stock
of successful startups: a rapidly growing company is valuable.  It&apos;s
a good thing eBay bought Paypal, for example, because Paypal is now
responsible for 43% of their sales and probably more of their growth.<br><br>But acquirers have an additional reason to want startups.  A rapidly
growing company is not merely valuable, but dangerous.  If it keeps
expanding, it might expand into the acquirer&apos;s own territory.  Most
product acquisitions have some component of fear.  Even if an
acquirer isn&apos;t threatened by the startup itself, they might be
alarmed at the thought of what a competitor could do with it.  And
because startups are in this sense doubly valuable to acquirers,
acquirers will often pay more than an ordinary investor would.

<b>Understand</b><br><br>The combination of founders, investors, and acquirers forms a natural
ecosystem.  It works so well that those who don&apos;t understand it are
driven to invent conspiracy theories to explain how neatly things
sometimes turn out.  Just as our ancestors did to explain the
apparently too neat workings of the natural world.  But there is
no secret cabal making it all work.<br><br>If you start from the mistaken assumption that Instagram was
worthless, you have to invent a secret boss to force Mark Zuckerberg
to buy it.  To anyone who knows Mark Zuckerberg that is the reductio
ad absurdum of the initial assumption.  The reason he bought Instagram
was that it was valuable and dangerous, and what made it so was
growth.<br><br>If you want to understand startups, understand growth.  Growth
drives everything in this world.  Growth is why startups usually
work on technology&#x2014;because ideas for fast growing companies are
so rare that the best way to find new ones is to discover those
recently made viable by change, and technology is the best source
of rapid change.  Growth is why it&apos;s a rational choice economically
for so many founders to try starting a startup: growth makes the
successful companies so valuable that the expected value is high
even though the risk is too.  Growth is why VCs want to invest in
startups: not just because the returns are high but also because
generating returns from capital gains is easier to manage than
generating returns from dividends.  Growth explains why the most
successful startups take VC money even if they don&apos;t need to: it
lets them choose their growth rate.  And growth explains why
successful startups almost invariably get acquisition offers.  To
acquirers a fast-growing company is not merely valuable but dangerous
too.<br><br>It&apos;s not just that if you want to succeed in some domain, you have
to understand the forces driving it.  Understanding growth is what
starting a startup <i>consists</i> of.  What you&apos;re really doing (and
to the dismay of some observers, all you&apos;re really doing) when you
start a startup is committing to solve a harder type of problem
than ordinary businesses do.  You&apos;re committing to search for one
of the rare ideas that generates rapid growth.  Because these ideas
are so valuable, finding one is hard.  The startup is the embodiment
of your discoveries so far.  Starting a startup is thus very much
like deciding to be a research scientist: you&apos;re not committing to
solve any specific problem; you don&apos;t know for sure which problems
are soluble; but you&apos;re committing to try to discover something no
one knew before.  A startup founder is in effect an economic research
scientist.  Most don&apos;t discover anything that remarkable, but some
discover relativity.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Strictly speaking it&apos;s not lots of customers you need but a big
market, meaning a high product of number of customers times how
much they&apos;ll pay.  But it&apos;s dangerous to have too few customers
even if they pay a lot, or the power that individual customers have
over you could turn you into a de facto consulting firm.  So whatever
market you&apos;re in, you&apos;ll usually do best to err on the side of
making the broadest type of product for it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
One year at Startup School David Heinemeier Hansson encouraged
programmers who wanted to start businesses to use a restaurant as
a model.  What he meant, I believe, is that it&apos;s fine to start
software companies constrained in (a) in the same way a restaurant
is constrained in (b).  I agree.  Most people should not try to
start startups.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
That sort of stepping back is one of the things we focus on at
Y Combinator.  It&apos;s common for founders to have discovered something
intuitively without understanding all its implications.  That&apos;s
probably true of the biggest discoveries in any field.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
I got it wrong in <a href="wealth.html">&quot;How to Make Wealth&quot;</a> when I said that a
startup was a small company that takes on a hard technical
problem.  That is the most common recipe but not the only one.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
In principle companies aren&apos;t limited by the size of the markets
they serve, because they could just expand into new markets.  But
there seem to be limits on the ability of big companies to do that.
Which means the slowdown that comes from bumping up against the
limits of one&apos;s markets is ultimately just another way in which
internal limits are expressed.<br><br>It may be that some of these limits could be overcome by changing
the shape of the organization&#x2014;specifically by sharding it.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
This is, obviously, only for startups that have already launched
or can launch during YC.  A startup building a new database will
probably not do that.  On the other hand, launching something small
and then using growth rate as evolutionary pressure is such a
valuable technique that any company that could start this way
probably should.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
If the startup is taking the Facebook/Twitter route and building
something they hope will be very popular but from which they don&apos;t
yet have a definite plan to make money, the growth rate has to be
higher, even though it&apos;s a proxy for revenue growth, because such
companies need huge numbers of users to succeed at all.<br><br>Beware too of the edge case where something spreads rapidly but the
churn is high as well, so that you have good net growth till you run
through all the potential users, at which point it suddenly stops.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Within YC when we say it&apos;s ipso facto right to do whatever gets
you growth, it&apos;s implicit that this excludes trickery like buying
users for more than their lifetime value, counting users as active
when they&apos;re really not, bleeding out invites at a regularly
increasing rate to manufacture a perfect growth curve, etc.  Even
if you were able to fool investors with such tricks, you&apos;d ultimately
be hurting yourself, because you&apos;re throwing off your own compass.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Which is why it&apos;s such a dangerous mistake to believe that
successful startups are simply the embodiment of some brilliant
initial idea.  What you&apos;re looking for initially is not so much a
great idea as an idea that could evolve into a great one.   The
danger is that promising ideas are not merely blurry versions of
great ones.  They&apos;re often different in kind, because the early
adopters you evolve the idea upon have different needs from the
rest of the market.  For example, the idea that evolves into Facebook
isn&apos;t merely a subset of Facebook; the idea that evolves into
Facebook is a site for Harvard undergrads.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
What if a company grew at 1.7x a year for a really long time?
Could it not grow just as big as any successful startup?  In principle
yes, of course. If our hypothetical company making $1000 a month
grew at 1% a week for 19 years, it would grow as big as a company
growing at 5% a week for 4 years.  But while such trajectories may
be common in, say, real estate development, you don&apos;t see them much
in the technology business.  In technology, companies that grow
slowly tend not to grow as big.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
Any expected value calculation varies from person to person
depending on their utility function for money.  I.e. the first
million is worth more to most people than subsequent millions.  How
much more depends on the person.  For founders who are younger or
more ambitious the utility function is flatter.  Which is probably
part of the reason the founders of the most successful startups of
all tend to be on the young side.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
More precisely, this is the case in the biggest winners, which
is where all the returns come from.  A startup founder could pull
the same trick of enriching himself at the company&apos;s expense by
selling them overpriced components.  But it wouldn&apos;t be worth it
for the founders of Google to do that.  Only founders of failing
startups would even be tempted, but those are writeoffs from the
VCs&apos; point of view anyway.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
Acquisitions fall into two categories: those where the acquirer
wants the business, and those where the acquirer just wants the
employees.  The latter type is sometimes called an HR acquisition.
Though nominally acquisitions and sometimes on a scale that has a
significant effect on the expected value calculation for potential
founders, HR acquisitions are viewed by acquirers as more akin to
hiring bonuses.<br><br>[<a name="f14n"><font color="#000000">14</font></a>]
I once explained this to some founders who had recently arrived
from Russia.  They found it novel that if you threatened a company
they&apos;d pay a premium for you.  &quot;In Russia they just kill you,&quot; they
said, and they were only partly joking.  Economically, the fact
that established companies can&apos;t simply eliminate new competitors
may be one of the most valuable aspects of the rule of law.  And
so to the extent we see incumbents suppressing competitors via
regulations or patent suits, we should worry, not because it&apos;s a
departure from the rule of law per se but from what the rule of law
is aiming at.<br><br>

October 2012<br><br>One advantage of Y Combinator&apos;s early, broad focus is that we
see trends before most other people.  And one of the most conspicuous
trends in the last batch was the large number of hardware startups.
Out of 84 companies, 7 were making hardware.  On the whole
they&apos;ve done better than the companies that weren&apos;t.<br><br>They&apos;ve faced resistance from investors of course.  Investors have
a deep-seated bias against hardware.  But investors&apos; opinions are
a trailing indicator.  The best founders are better at seeing the
future than the best investors, because the best founders are making
it.<br><br>There is no one single force driving this trend.  Hardware <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/pebble-smartwatch-tops-out-at-10-million-on-kickstarter/">does
well</a> on crowdfunding sites.  The spread of <a href="http://paulgraham.com/tablets.html">tablets</a> makes it
possible to build new things <a href="http://lockitron.com">controlled
by</a> and even <a href="http://doublerobotics.com">incorporating</a>
them.  <a href="http://www.boostedboards.com/">Electric motors</a>
 have improved.
Wireless connectivity of various types can now be taken for granted.
It&apos;s getting more straightforward to get things manufactured.
Arduinos, 3D printing, laser cutters, and more accessible CNC milling are making hardware easier to prototype.
Retailers are less of a bottleneck as customers increasingly buy
online.<br><br>One question I can answer is why hardware is suddenly cool.
It always was cool.
Physical things are great.  They just haven&apos;t
been as great a way to start a <a href="growth.html">rapidly growing</a> business
as software.  But that rule may not be permanent.  It&apos;s not even
that old; it only dates from about 1990.  Maybe the advantage
of software will turn out to have been temporary.  Hackers love to
build hardware, and customers love to buy it.  So if the ease of
shipping hardware even approached the ease of shipping software,
we&apos;d see a lot more hardware startups.<br><br>It wouldn&apos;t be the first time something was a bad idea till it
wasn&apos;t.  And it wouldn&apos;t be the first time investors learned that
lesson from founders.<br><br>So if you want to work on hardware, don&apos;t be deterred from doing
it because you worry investors will discriminate against you.  And
in particular, don&apos;t be deterred from <a href="http://ycombinator.com/apply.html">applying</a> to Y Combinator
with a hardware idea, because we&apos;re especially interested in hardware

<p>
November 2012<br><br>The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup
ideas.  It&apos;s to look for problems, preferably problems you have
yourself.<br><br>The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common:
they&apos;re something the founders themselves want, that they themselves
can build, and that few others realize are worth doing.  Microsoft,
Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began this way.<br><br>
<b>Problems</b><br><br>Why is it so important to work on a problem you have?  Among other
things, it ensures the problem really exists.  It sounds obvious
to say you should only work on problems that exist.  And yet by far
the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one
has.<br><br>I made it myself.  In 1995 I started a company to put art galleries
online.  But galleries didn&apos;t want to be online.  It&apos;s not how the
art business works.  So why did I spend 6 months working on this
stupid idea?  Because I didn&apos;t pay attention to users.  I invented
a model of the world that didn&apos;t correspond to reality, and worked
from that.  I didn&apos;t notice my model was wrong until I tried
to convince users to pay for what we&apos;d built.  Even then I took
embarrassingly long to catch on.  I was attached to my model of the
world, and I&apos;d spent a lot of time on the software.  They had to
want it!<br><br>Why do so many founders build things no one wants?  Because they
begin by trying to think of startup ideas.  That m.o. is doubly
dangerous: it doesn&apos;t merely yield few good ideas; it yields bad
ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them.<br><br>At YC we call these &quot;made-up&quot; or &quot;sitcom&quot; startup ideas.  Imagine
one of the characters on a TV show was starting a startup.  The
writers would have to invent something for it to do.  But coming
up with good startup ideas is hard.  It&apos;s not something you can do
for the asking.  So (unless they got amazingly lucky) the writers
would come up with an idea that sounded plausible, but was actually
bad.<br><br>For example, a social network for pet owners.  It doesn&apos;t sound
obviously mistaken.  Millions of people have pets.  Often they care
a lot about their pets and spend a lot of money on them.  Surely
many of these people would like a site where they could talk to
other pet owners.  Not all of them perhaps, but if just 2 or 3
percent were regular visitors, you could have millions of users.
You could serve them targeted offers, and maybe charge for premium
features. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by your
friends with pets, they don&apos;t say &quot;I would <i>never</i> use this.&quot; They
say &quot;Yeah, maybe I could see using something like that.&quot; Even when
the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people.
They don&apos;t want to use it themselves, at least not right now, but
they could imagine other people wanting it.  Sum that reaction
across the entire population, and you have zero users. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Well</b><br><br>When a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who
really need what they&apos;re making&#x2014;not just people who could see
themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently.  Usually
this initial group of users is small, for the simple reason that
if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed
and that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usually
puts into a version one, it would probably already exist.  Which
means you have to compromise on one dimension: you can either build
something a large number of people want a small amount, or something
a small number of people want a large amount.  Choose the latter.
Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all
good startup ideas are of that type.<br><br>Imagine a graph whose x axis represents all the people who might
want what you&apos;re making and whose y axis represents how much they
want it.  If you invert the scale on the y axis, you can envision
companies as holes.  Google is an immense crater: hundreds of
millions of people use it, and they need it a lot.  A startup just
starting out can&apos;t expect to excavate that much volume.  So you
have two choices about the shape of hole you start with.  You can
either dig a hole that&apos;s broad but shallow, or one that&apos;s narrow
and deep, like a well.<br><br>Made-up startup ideas are usually of the first type.  Lots of people
are mildly interested in a social network for pet owners.<br><br>Nearly all good startup ideas are of the second type.  Microsoft
was a well when they made Altair Basic.  There were only a couple
thousand Altair owners, but without this software they were programming
in machine language.  Thirty years later Facebook had the same
shape.  Their first site was exclusively for Harvard students, of
which there are only a few thousand, but those few thousand users
wanted it a lot.<br><br>When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this
right now?  Who wants this so much that they&apos;ll use it even when
it&apos;s a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they&apos;ve never
heard of?  If you can&apos;t answer that, the idea is probably bad. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>You don&apos;t need the narrowness of the well per se.  It&apos;s depth you
need; you get narrowness as a byproduct of optimizing for depth
(and speed).  But you almost always do get it.  In practice the
link between depth and narrowness is so strong that it&apos;s a good
sign when you know that an idea will appeal strongly to a specific
group or type of user.<br><br>But while demand shaped like a well is almost a necessary condition
for a good startup idea, it&apos;s not a sufficient one.  If Mark
Zuckerberg had built something that could only ever have appealed
to Harvard students, it would not have been a good startup idea.
Facebook was a good idea because it started with a small market
there was a fast path out of.  Colleges are similar enough that if
you build a facebook that works at Harvard, it will work at any
college. So you spread rapidly through all the colleges.  Once you
have all the college students, you get everyone else simply by
letting them in.<br><br>Similarly for Microsoft: Basic for the Altair; Basic for other
machines; other languages besides Basic; operating systems;
applications; IPO.<br><br>
<b>Self</b><br><br>How do you tell whether there&apos;s a path out of an idea?  How do you
tell whether something is the germ of a giant company, or just a
niche product?  Often you can&apos;t. The founders of Airbnb didn&apos;t
realize at first how big a market they were tapping.  Initially
they had a much narrower idea.  They were going to let hosts rent
out space on their floors during conventions.  They didn&apos;t foresee
the expansion of this idea; it forced itself upon them gradually.
All they knew at first is that they were onto something.  That&apos;s
probably as much as Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg knew at first.<br><br>Occasionally it&apos;s obvious from the beginning when there&apos;s a path
out of the initial niche.  And sometimes I can see a path that&apos;s
not immediately obvious; that&apos;s one of our specialties at YC.  But
there are limits to how well this can be done, no matter how much
experience you have.  The most important thing to understand about
paths out of the initial idea is the meta-fact that these are hard
to see.<br><br>So if you can&apos;t predict whether there&apos;s a path out of an idea, how
do you choose between ideas?  The truth is disappointing but
interesting: if you&apos;re the right sort of person, you have the right
sort of hunches.  If you&apos;re at the leading edge of a field that&apos;s
changing fast, when you have a hunch that something is worth doing,
you&apos;re more likely to be right.<br><br>In <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>, Robert Pirsig says:
<blockquote>
  You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It&apos;s easy.  Make
  yourself perfect and then just paint naturally.
</blockquote>
I&apos;ve wondered about that passage since I read it in high school.
I&apos;m not sure how useful his advice is for painting specifically,
but it fits this situation well.  Empirically, the way to have good
startup ideas is to become the sort of person who has them.<br><br>Being at the leading edge of a field doesn&apos;t mean you have to be
one of the people pushing it forward.  You can also be at the leading
edge as a user.  It was not so much because he was a programmer
that Facebook seemed a good idea to Mark Zuckerberg as because he
used computers so much.  If you&apos;d asked most 40 year olds in 2004
whether they&apos;d like to publish their lives semi-publicly on the
Internet, they&apos;d have been horrified at the idea.  But Mark already
lived online; to him it seemed natural.<br><br>Paul Buchheit says that people at the leading edge of a rapidly
changing field &quot;live in the future.&quot;  Combine that with Pirsig and
you get:
<blockquote>
  Live in the future, then build what&apos;s missing.
</blockquote>
That describes the way many if not most of the biggest startups got
started.  Neither Apple nor Yahoo nor Google nor Facebook were even
supposed to be companies at first.  They grew out of things their
founders built because there seemed a gap in the world.<br><br>If you look at the way successful founders have had their ideas,
it&apos;s generally the result of some external stimulus hitting a
prepared mind.  Bill Gates and Paul Allen hear about the Altair and
think &quot;I bet we could write a Basic interpreter for it.&quot; Drew Houston
realizes he&apos;s forgotten his USB stick and thinks &quot;I really need to
make my files live online.&quot; Lots of people heard about the Altair.
Lots forgot USB sticks.  The reason those stimuli caused those
founders to start companies was that their experiences had prepared
them to notice the opportunities they represented.<br><br>The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not
&quot;think up&quot; but &quot;notice.&quot; At YC we call ideas that grow naturally
out of the founders&apos; own experiences &quot;organic&quot; startup ideas.  The
most successful startups almost all begin this way.<br><br>That may not have been what you wanted to hear.  You may have
expected recipes for coming up with startup ideas, and instead I&apos;m
telling you that the key is to have a mind that&apos;s prepared in the
right way.  But disappointing though it may be, this is the truth.
And it is a recipe of a sort, just one that in the worst case takes
a year rather than a weekend.<br><br>If you&apos;re not at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field,
you can get to one.  For example, anyone reasonably smart can
probably get to an edge of programming (e.g. building mobile apps)
in a year.  Since a successful startup will consume at least 3-5
years of your life, a year&apos;s preparation would be a reasonable
investment.  Especially if you&apos;re also looking for a cofounder.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>You don&apos;t have to learn programming to be at the leading edge of a
domain that&apos;s changing fast.  Other domains change fast.  But while
learning to hack is not necessary, it is for the forseeable future
sufficient. As Marc Andreessen put it, software is eating the world,
and this trend has decades left to run.<br><br>Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you&apos;ll be
able to implement them.  That&apos;s not absolutely necessary (Jeff Bezos
couldn&apos;t) but it&apos;s an advantage.  It&apos;s a big advantage, when you&apos;re
considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if
instead of merely thinking &quot;That&apos;s an interesting idea,&quot; you can
think instead &quot;That&apos;s an interesting idea.  I&apos;ll try building an
initial version tonight.&quot;  It&apos;s even better when you&apos;re both a
programmer and the target user, because then the cycle of generating
new versions and testing them on users can happen inside one head.<br><br>
<b>Noticing</b><br><br>Once you&apos;re living in the future in some respect, the way to notice
startup ideas is to look for things that seem to be missing.  If
you&apos;re really at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field, there
will be things that are obviously missing.  What won&apos;t be obvious
is that they&apos;re startup ideas.  So if you want to find startup
ideas, don&apos;t merely turn on the filter &quot;What&apos;s missing?&quot; Also turn
off every other filter, particularly &quot;Could this be a big company?&quot;
There&apos;s plenty of time to apply that test later.  But if you&apos;re
thinking about that initially, it may not only filter out lots
of good ideas, but also cause you to focus on bad ones.<br><br>Most things that are missing will take some time to see.  You almost
have to trick yourself into seeing the ideas around you.<br><br>But you <i>know</i> the ideas are out there.  This is not one of those
problems where there might not be an answer.  It&apos;s impossibly
unlikely that this is the exact moment when technological progress
stops.  You can be sure people are going to build things in the
next few years that will make you think &quot;What did I do before x?&quot;<br><br>And when these problems get solved, they will probably seem flamingly
obvious in retrospect.  What you need to do is turn off the filters
that usually prevent you from seeing them.  The most powerful is
simply taking the current state of the world for granted.  Even the
most radically open-minded of us mostly do that.  You couldn&apos;t get
from your bed to the front door if you stopped to question everything.<br><br>But if you&apos;re looking for startup ideas you can sacrifice some of
the efficiency of taking the status quo for granted and start to
question things.  Why is your inbox overflowing?  Because you get
a lot of email, or because it&apos;s hard to get email out of your inbox?
Why do you get so much email?  What problems are people trying to
solve by sending you email?  Are there better ways to solve them?
And why is it hard to get emails out of your inbox?  Why do you
keep emails around after you&apos;ve read them?  Is an inbox the optimal
tool for that?<br><br>Pay particular attention to things that chafe you.  The advantage
of taking the status quo for granted is not just that it makes life
(locally) more efficient, but also that it makes life more tolerable.
If you knew about all the things we&apos;ll get in the next 50 years but
don&apos;t have yet, you&apos;d find present day life pretty constraining,
just as someone from the present would if they were sent back 50
years in a time machine.  When something annoys you, it could be
because you&apos;re living in the future.<br><br>When you find the right sort of problem, you should probably be
able to describe it as <i>obvious</i>, at least to you.  When we started
Viaweb, all the online stores were built by hand, by web designers
making individual HTML pages.  It was obvious to us as programmers
that these sites would have to be generated by software.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Which means, strangely enough, that coming up with startup ideas
is a question of seeing the obvious.  That suggests how weird this
process is: you&apos;re trying to see things that are obvious, and yet
that you hadn&apos;t seen.<br><br>Since what you need to do here is loosen up your own mind, it may
be best not to make too much of a direct frontal attack on the
problem&#x2014;i.e. to sit down and try to think of ideas.  The best
plan may be just to keep a background process running, looking for
things that seem to be missing.  Work on hard problems, driven
mainly by curiosity, but have a second self watching over your
shoulder, taking note of gaps and anomalies.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Give yourself some time.  You have a lot of control over the rate
at which you turn yours into a prepared mind, but you have less
control over the stimuli that spark ideas when they hit it.  If
Bill Gates and Paul Allen had constrained themselves to come up
with a startup idea in one month, what if they&apos;d chosen a month
before the Altair appeared?  They probably would have worked on a
less promising idea.  Drew Houston did work on a less promising
idea before Dropbox: an SAT prep startup.  But Dropbox was a much
better idea, both in the absolute sense and also as a match for his
skills.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>A good way to trick yourself into noticing ideas is to work on
projects that seem like they&apos;d be cool.  If you do that, you&apos;ll
naturally tend to build things that are missing.  It wouldn&apos;t seem
as interesting to build something that already existed.<br><br>Just as trying to think up startup ideas tends to produce bad ones,
working on things that could be dismissed as &quot;toys&quot; often produces
good ones.  When something is described as a toy, that means it has
everything an idea needs except being important.  It&apos;s cool; users
love it; it just doesn&apos;t matter.  But if you&apos;re living in the future
and you build something cool that users love, it may matter more
than outsiders think.  Microcomputers seemed like toys when Apple
and Microsoft started working on them.  I&apos;m old enough to remember
that era; the usual term for people with their own microcomputers
was &quot;hobbyists.&quot;  BackRub seemed like an inconsequential science
project.  The Facebook was just a way for undergrads to stalk one
another.<br><br>At YC we&apos;re excited when we meet startups working on things that
we could imagine know-it-alls on forums dismissing as toys.  To us
that&apos;s positive evidence an idea is good.<br><br>If you can afford to take a long view (and arguably you can&apos;t afford
not to), you can turn &quot;Live in the future and build what&apos;s missing&quot;
into something even better:
<blockquote>
  Live in the future and build what seems interesting.
</blockquote><br><br>
<b>School</b><br><br>That&apos;s what I&apos;d advise college students to do, rather than trying
to learn about &quot;entrepreneurship.&quot;  &quot;Entrepreneurship&quot; is something
you learn best by doing it.  The examples of the most successful
founders make that clear.  What you should be spending your time
on in college is ratcheting yourself into the future.  College is
an incomparable opportunity to do that.  What a waste to sacrifice
an opportunity to solve the hard part of starting a startup&#x2014;becoming 
the sort of person who can have organic startup ideas&#x2014;by 
spending time learning about the easy part.  Especially since
you won&apos;t even really learn about it, any more than you&apos;d learn
about sex in a class.  All you&apos;ll learn is the words for things.<br><br>The clash of domains is a particularly fruitful source of ideas.
If you know a lot about programming and you start learning about
some other field, you&apos;ll probably see problems that software could
solve.  In fact, you&apos;re doubly likely to find good problems in
another domain: (a) the inhabitants of that domain are not as likely
as software people to have already solved their problems with
software, and (b) since you come into the new domain totally ignorant,
you don&apos;t even know what the status quo is to take it for granted.<br><br>So if you&apos;re a CS major and you want to start a startup, instead
of taking a class on entrepreneurship you&apos;re better off taking a
class on, say, genetics.  Or better still, go work for a biotech
company.  CS majors normally get summer jobs at computer hardware
or software companies.  But if you want to find startup ideas, you
might do better to get a summer job in some unrelated field. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>Or don&apos;t take any extra classes, and just build things.  It&apos;s no
coincidence that Microsoft and Facebook both got started in January.
At Harvard that is (or was) Reading Period, when students have no
classes to attend because they&apos;re supposed to be studying for finals.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>But don&apos;t feel like you have to build things that will become startups.  That&apos;s
premature optimization. Just build things.  Preferably with other
students.  It&apos;s not just the classes that make a university such a
good place to crank oneself into the future.  You&apos;re also surrounded
by other people trying to do the same thing.  If you work together
with them on projects, you&apos;ll end up producing not just organic
ideas, but organic ideas with organic founding teams&#x2014;and that,
empirically, is the best combination.<br><br>Beware of research.  If an undergrad writes something all his friends
start using, it&apos;s quite likely to represent a good startup idea.
Whereas a PhD dissertation is extremely unlikely to.  For some
reason, the more a project has to count as research, the less likely
it is to be something that could be turned into a startup.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font>
I think the reason is that the subset of ideas that count as research
is so narrow that it&apos;s unlikely that a project that satisfied that
constraint would also satisfy the orthogonal constraint of solving
users&apos; problems.  Whereas when students (or professors) build
something as a side-project, they automatically gravitate toward
solving users&apos; problems&#x2014;perhaps even with an additional energy
that comes from being freed from the constraints of research.<br><br>
<b>Competition</b><br><br>Because a good idea should seem obvious, when you have one you&apos;ll
tend to feel that you&apos;re late.  Don&apos;t let that deter you.  Worrying
that you&apos;re late is one of the signs of a good idea.  Ten minutes
of searching the web will usually settle the question.  Even if you
find someone else working on the same thing, you&apos;re probably not
too late.  It&apos;s exceptionally rare for startups to be killed by
competitors&#x2014;so rare that you can almost discount the possibility.
So unless you discover a competitor with the sort of lock-in that
would prevent users from choosing you, don&apos;t discard the idea.<br><br>If you&apos;re uncertain, ask users.  The question of whether you&apos;re too
late is subsumed by the question of whether anyone urgently needs
what you plan to make.  If you have something that no competitor
does and that some subset of users urgently need, you have a
beachhead.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>The question then is whether that beachhead is big enough. Or more
importantly, who&apos;s in it: if the beachhead consists of people doing
something lots more people will be doing in the future, then it&apos;s
probably big enough no matter how small it is.  For example, if
you&apos;re building something differentiated from competitors by the
fact that it works on phones, but it only works on the newest phones,
that&apos;s probably a big enough beachhead.<br><br>Err on the side of doing things where you&apos;ll face competitors.
Inexperienced founders usually give competitors more credit than
they deserve.  Whether you succeed depends far more on you than on
your competitors.  So better a good idea with competitors than a
bad one without.<br><br>You don&apos;t need to worry about entering a &quot;crowded market&quot; so long
as you have a thesis about what everyone else in it is overlooking.
In fact that&apos;s a very promising starting point.  Google was that
type of idea.  Your thesis has to be more precise than &quot;we&apos;re going
to make an x that doesn&apos;t suck&quot; though. You have to be able to
phrase it in terms of something the incumbents are overlooking.
Best of all is when you can say that they didn&apos;t have the courage
of their convictions, and that your plan is what they&apos;d have done
if they&apos;d followed through on their own insights.  Google was that
type of idea too.  The search engines that preceded them shied away
from the most radical implications of what they were doing&#x2014;particularly 
that the better a job they did, the faster users would
leave.<br><br>A crowded market is actually a good sign, because it means both
that there&apos;s demand and that none of the existing solutions are
good enough.  A startup can&apos;t hope to enter a market that&apos;s obviously
big and yet in which they have no competitors.  So any startup that
succeeds is either going to be entering a market with existing
competitors, but armed with some secret weapon that will get them
all the users (like Google), or entering a market that looks small
but which will turn out to be big (like Microsoft).  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Filters</b><br><br>There are two more filters you&apos;ll need to turn off if you want to
notice startup ideas: the unsexy filter and the schlep filter.<br><br>Most programmers wish they could start a startup by just writing
some brilliant code, pushing it to a server, and having users pay
them lots of money.  They&apos;d prefer not to deal with tedious problems
or get involved in messy ways with the real world.  Which is a
reasonable preference, because such things slow you down.  But this
preference is so widespread that the space of convenient startup
ideas has been stripped pretty clean.  If you let your mind wander
a few blocks down the street to the messy, tedious ideas, you&apos;ll
find valuable ones just sitting there waiting to be implemented.<br><br>The schlep filter is so dangerous that I wrote a separate essay
about the condition it induces, which I called 
<a href="schlep.html">schlep blindness</a>.
I gave Stripe as an example of a startup that benefited from turning
off this filter, and a pretty striking example it is.  Thousands
of programmers were in a position to see this idea; thousands of
programmers knew how painful it was to process payments before
Stripe.  But when they looked for startup ideas they didn&apos;t see
this one, because unconsciously they shrank from having to deal
with payments.  And dealing with payments is a schlep for Stripe,
but not an intolerable one.  In fact they might have had net less
pain; because the fear of dealing with payments kept most people
away from this idea, Stripe has had comparatively smooth sailing
in other areas that are sometimes painful, like user acquisition.
They didn&apos;t have to try very hard to make themselves heard by users,
because users were desperately waiting for what they were building.<br><br>The unsexy filter is similar to the schlep filter, except it keeps
you from working on problems you despise rather than ones you fear.
We overcame this one to work on Viaweb. There were interesting
things about the architecture of our software, but we weren&apos;t
interested in ecommerce per se.  We could see the problem was one
that needed to be solved though.<br><br>Turning off the schlep filter is more important than turning off
the unsexy filter, because the schlep filter is more likely to be
an illusion.  And even to the degree it isn&apos;t, it&apos;s a worse form
of self-indulgence.  Starting a successful startup is going to be
fairly laborious no matter what.  Even if the product doesn&apos;t entail
a lot of schleps, you&apos;ll still have plenty dealing with investors,
hiring and firing people, and so on.  So if there&apos;s some idea you
think would be cool but you&apos;re kept away from by fear of the schleps
involved, don&apos;t worry: any sufficiently good idea will have as many.<br><br>The unsexy filter, while still a source of error, is not as entirely
useless as the schlep filter.  If you&apos;re at the leading edge of a
field that&apos;s changing rapidly, your ideas about what&apos;s sexy will
be somewhat correlated with what&apos;s valuable in practice.  Particularly
as you get older and more experienced.  Plus if you find an idea
sexy, you&apos;ll work on it more enthusiastically. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Recipes</b><br><br>While the best way to discover startup ideas is to become the sort
of person who has them and then build whatever interests you,
sometimes you don&apos;t have that luxury.  Sometimes you need an idea
now.  For example, if you&apos;re working on a startup and your initial
idea turns out to be bad.<br><br>For the rest of this essay I&apos;ll talk about tricks for coming up
with startup ideas on demand.  Although empirically you&apos;re better
off using the organic strategy, you could succeed this way. You
just have to be more disciplined.  When you use the organic method,
you don&apos;t even notice an idea unless it&apos;s evidence that something
is truly missing.  But when you make a conscious effort to think
of startup ideas, you have to replace this natural constraint with
self-discipline.  You&apos;ll see a lot more ideas, most of them bad,
so you need to be able to filter them.<br><br>One of the biggest dangers of not using the organic method is the
example of the organic method.  Organic ideas feel like inspirations.
There are a lot of stories about successful startups that began
when the founders had what seemed a crazy idea but &quot;just knew&quot; it
was promising.  When you feel that about an idea you&apos;ve had while
trying to come up with startup ideas, you&apos;re probably mistaken.<br><br>When searching for ideas, look in areas where you have some expertise.
If you&apos;re a database expert, don&apos;t build a chat app for teenagers
(unless you&apos;re also a teenager).  Maybe it&apos;s a good idea, but you
can&apos;t trust your judgment about that, so ignore it.  There have to
be other ideas that involve databases, and whose quality you can
judge.  Do you find it hard to come up with good ideas involving
databases?  That&apos;s because your expertise raises your standards.
Your ideas about chat apps are just as bad, but you&apos;re giving
yourself a Dunning-Kruger pass in that domain.<br><br>The place to start looking for ideas is things you need.  There
<i>must</i> be things you need.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#999999">14</font></a>]</font><br><br>One good trick is to ask yourself whether in your previous job you
ever found yourself saying &quot;Why doesn&apos;t someone make x?  If someone
made x we&apos;d buy it in a second.&quot; If you can think of any x people
said that about, you probably have an idea.  You know there&apos;s demand,
and people don&apos;t say that about things that are impossible to build.<br><br>More generally, try asking yourself whether there&apos;s something unusual
about you that makes your needs different from most other people&apos;s.
You&apos;re probably not the only one.  It&apos;s especially good if you&apos;re
different in a way people will increasingly be.<br><br>If you&apos;re changing ideas, one unusual thing about you is the idea
you&apos;d previously been working on.  Did you discover any needs while
working on it?  Several well-known startups began this way.  Hotmail
began as something its founders wrote to talk about their previous
startup idea while they were working at their day jobs. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#999999">15</font></a>]</font><br><br>A particularly promising way to be unusual is to be young.  Some
of the most valuable new ideas take root first among people in their
teens and early twenties.  And while young founders are at a
disadvantage in some respects, they&apos;re the only ones who really
understand their peers.  It would have been very hard for someone
who wasn&apos;t a college student to start Facebook.  So if you&apos;re a
young founder (under 23 say), are there things you and your friends
would like to do that current technology won&apos;t let you?<br><br>The next best thing to an unmet need of your own is an unmet need
of someone else.  Try talking to everyone you can about the gaps
they find in the world.  What&apos;s missing?  What would they like to
do that they can&apos;t?  What&apos;s tedious or annoying, particularly in
their work?  Let the conversation get general; don&apos;t be trying too
hard to find startup ideas.  You&apos;re just looking for something to
spark a thought.  Maybe you&apos;ll notice a problem they didn&apos;t consciously
realize they had, because you know how to solve it.<br><br>When you find an unmet need that isn&apos;t your own, it may be somewhat
blurry at first.  The person who needs something may not know exactly
what they need.  In that case I often recommend that founders act
like consultants&#x2014;that they do what they&apos;d do if they&apos;d been
retained to solve the problems of this one user.  People&apos;s problems
are similar enough that nearly all the code you write this way will
be reusable, and whatever isn&apos;t will be a small price to start out
certain that you&apos;ve reached the bottom of the well.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#999999">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>One way to ensure you do a good job solving other people&apos;s problems
is to make them your own.  When Rajat Suri of E la Carte decided
to write software for restaurants, he got a job as a waiter to learn
how restaurants worked.  That may seem like taking things to extremes,
but startups are extreme.  We love it when founders do such things.<br><br>In fact, one strategy I recommend to people who need a new idea is
not merely to turn off their schlep and unsexy filters, but to seek
out ideas that are unsexy or involve schleps.  Don&apos;t try to start
Twitter.  Those ideas are so rare that you can&apos;t find them by looking
for them.  Make something unsexy that people will pay you for.<br><br>A good trick for bypassing the schlep and to some extent the unsexy
filter is to ask what you wish someone else would build, so that
you could use it.  What would you pay for right now?<br><br>Since startups often garbage-collect broken companies and industries,
it can be a good trick to look for those that are dying, or deserve
to, and try to imagine what kind of company would profit from their
demise.  For example, journalism is in free fall at the moment.
But there may still be money to be made from something like journalism.
What sort of company might cause people in the future to say &quot;this
replaced journalism&quot; on some axis?<br><br>But imagine asking that in the future, not now.  When one company
or industry replaces another, it usually comes in from the side.
So don&apos;t look for a replacement for x; look for something that
people will later say turned out to be a replacement for x.  And
be imaginative about the axis along which the replacement occurs.
Traditional journalism, for example, is a way for readers to get
information and to kill time, a way for writers to make money and
to get attention, and a vehicle for several different types of
advertising.  It could be replaced on any of these axes (it has
already started to be on most).<br><br>When startups consume incumbents, they usually start by serving
some small but important market that the big players ignore.  It&apos;s
particularly good if there&apos;s an admixture of disdain in the big
players&apos; attitude, because that often misleads them.  For example,
after Steve Wozniak built the computer that became the Apple I, he
felt obliged to give his then-employer Hewlett-Packard the option
to produce it.  Fortunately for him, they turned it down, and one
of the reasons they did was that it used a TV for a monitor, which
seemed intolerably d&#xFFFD;class&#xFFFD; to a high-end hardware company like HP
was at the time. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f17n"><font color="#999999">17</font></a>]</font><br><br>Are there groups of 
<a href="marginal.html">scruffy</a> 
but sophisticated users like the early
microcomputer &quot;hobbyists&quot; that are currently being ignored by the
big players?  A startup with its sights set on bigger things can
often capture a small market easily by expending an effort that
wouldn&apos;t be justified by that market alone.<br><br>Similarly, since the most successful startups generally ride some
wave bigger than themselves, it could be a good trick to look for
waves and ask how one could benefit from them.  The prices of gene
sequencing and 3D printing are both experiencing Moore&apos;s Law-like
declines.  What new things will we be able to do in the new world
we&apos;ll have in a few years?  What are we unconsciously ruling out
as impossible that will soon be possible?<br><br>
<b>Organic</b><br><br>But talking about looking explicitly for waves makes it clear that
such recipes are plan B for getting startup ideas.  Looking for
waves is essentially a way to simulate the organic method.  If
you&apos;re at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you don&apos;t
have to look for waves; you are the wave.<br><br>Finding startup ideas is a subtle business, and that&apos;s why most
people who try fail so miserably.  It doesn&apos;t work well simply to
try to think of startup ideas.  If you do that, you get bad ones
that sound dangerously plausible.  The best approach is more indirect:
if you have the right sort of background, good startup ideas will
seem obvious to you.  But even then, not immediately.  It takes
time to come across situations where you notice something missing.
And often these gaps won&apos;t seem to be ideas for companies, just
things that would be interesting to build.  Which is why it&apos;s good
to have the time and the inclination to build things just because
they&apos;re interesting.<br><br>Live in the future and build what seems interesting.  Strange as
it sounds, that&apos;s the real recipe.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This form of bad idea has been around as long as the web.  It
was common in the 1990s, except then people who had it used to say
they were going to create a portal for x instead of a social network
for x.  Structurally the idea is stone soup: you post a sign saying
&quot;this is the place for people interested in x,&quot; and all those people
show up and you make money from them.  What lures founders into
this sort of idea are statistics about the millions of people who
might be interested in each type of x.  What they forget is that
any given person might have 20 affinities by this standard, and no
one is going to visit 20 different communities regularly.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
I&apos;m not saying, incidentally, that I know for sure a social
network for pet owners is a bad idea.  I know it&apos;s a bad idea the
way I know randomly generated DNA would not produce a viable organism.
The set of plausible sounding startup ideas is many times larger
than the set of good ones, and many of the good ones don&apos;t even
sound that plausible.  So if all you know about a startup idea is
that it sounds plausible, you have to assume it&apos;s bad.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
More precisely, the users&apos; need has to give them sufficient
activation energy to start using whatever you make, which can vary
a lot.  For example, the activation energy for enterprise software
sold through traditional channels is very high, so you&apos;d have to
be a <i>lot</i> better to get users to switch.  Whereas the activation
energy required to switch to a new search engine is low.  Which in
turn is why search engines are so much better than enterprise
software.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
This gets harder as you get older.  While the space of ideas
doesn&apos;t have dangerous local maxima, the space of careers does.
There are fairly high walls between most of the paths people take
through life, and the older you get, the higher the walls become.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
It was also obvious to us that the web was going to be a big
deal.  Few non-programmers grasped that in 1995, but the programmers
had seen what GUIs had done for desktop computers.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Maybe it would work to have this second self keep a journal,
and each night to make a brief entry listing the gaps and anomalies
you&apos;d noticed that day.  Not startup ideas, just the raw gaps and
anomalies.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Sam Altman points out that taking time to come up with an
idea is not merely a better strategy in an absolute sense, but also
like an undervalued stock in that so few founders do it.<br><br>There&apos;s comparatively little competition for the best ideas, because
few founders are willing to put in the time required to notice them.
Whereas there is a great deal of competition for mediocre ideas,
because when people make up startup ideas, they tend to make up the
same ones.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
For the computer hardware and software companies, summer jobs
are the first phase of the recruiting funnel.  But if you&apos;re good
you can skip the first phase.  If you&apos;re good you&apos;ll have no trouble
getting hired by these companies when you graduate, regardless of
how you spent your summers.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
The empirical evidence suggests that if colleges want to help
their students start startups, the best thing they can do is leave
them alone in the right way.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
I&apos;m speaking here of IT startups; in biotech things are different.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
This is an instance of a more general rule: focus on users,
not competitors.  The most important information about competitors
is what you learn via users anyway.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
In practice most successful startups have elements of both.
And you can describe each strategy in terms of the other by adjusting
the boundaries of what you call the market.  But it&apos;s useful to
consider these two ideas separately.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
I almost hesitate to raise that point though.  Startups are
businesses; the point of a business is to make money; and with that
additional constraint, you can&apos;t expect you&apos;ll be able to spend all
your time working on what interests you most.<br><br>[<a name="f14n"><font color="#000000">14</font></a>]
The need has to be a strong one.  You can retroactively
describe any made-up idea as something you need.  But do you really
need that recipe site or local event aggregator as much as Drew
Houston needed Dropbox, or Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia needed Airbnb?<br><br>Quite often at YC I find myself asking founders &quot;Would you use this
thing yourself, if you hadn&apos;t written it?&quot; and you&apos;d be surprised
how often the answer is no.<br><br>[<a name="f15n"><font color="#000000">15</font></a>]
Paul Buchheit points out that trying to sell something bad
can be a source of better ideas:<br><br>&quot;The best technique I&apos;ve found for dealing with YC companies that
have bad ideas is to tell them to go sell the product ASAP (before
wasting time building it). Not only do they learn that nobody
wants what they are building, they very often come back with a
real idea that they discovered in the process of trying to sell
the bad idea.&quot;<br><br>[<a name="f16n"><font color="#000000">16</font></a>]
Here&apos;s a recipe that might produce the next Facebook, if
you&apos;re college students.  If you have a connection to one of the
more powerful sororities at your school, approach the queen bees
thereof and offer to be their personal IT consultants, building
anything they could imagine needing in their social lives that
didn&apos;t already exist.  Anything that got built this way would be
very promising, because such users are not just the most demanding
but also the perfect point to spread from.<br><br>I have no idea whether this would work.<br><br>[<a name="f17n"><font color="#000000">17</font></a>]
And the reason it used a TV for a monitor is that Steve Wozniak
started out by solving his own problems.  He, like most of his
peers, couldn&apos;t afford a monitor.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Mike Arrington, Paul Buchheit, John Collison,

batch, which has 53.  The total valuation of the 287 that have
valuations (either by raising an equity round, getting acquired,
or dying) is about $11.7 billion, and the 511 prior to the current
batch have collectively raised about $1.7 billion.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>As usual those numbers are dominated by a few big winners.  The top
10 startups account for 8.6 of that 11.7 billion.  But there is a
peloton of younger startups behind them.  There are about 40 more
that have a shot at being really big.<br><br>Things got a little out of hand last summer when we had 84 companies
in the batch, so we tightened up our filter to decrease the batch
size. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Several journalists have tried to interpret that as
evidence for some macro story they were telling, but the reason had
nothing to do with any external trend.  The reason was that we
discovered we were using an n&#xB2; algorithm, and we needed to buy
time to fix it.  Fortunately we&apos;ve come up with several techniques
for sharding YC, and the problem now seems to be fixed.  With a new
more scaleable model and only 53 companies, the current batch feels
like a walk in the park.  I&apos;d guess we can grow another 2 or 3x
before hitting the next bottleneck. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>One consequence of funding such a large number of startups is that
we see trends early.  And since fundraising is one of the main
things we help startups with, we&apos;re in a good position to notice
trends in investing.<br><br>I&apos;m going to take a shot at describing where these trends are
leading.  Let&apos;s start with the most basic question: will the future
be better or worse than the past?  Will investors, in the aggregate,
make more money or less?<br><br>I think more.  There are multiple forces at work, some of which
will decrease returns, and some of which will increase them.  I
can&apos;t predict for sure which forces will prevail, but I&apos;ll describe
them and you can decide for yourself.<br><br>There are two big forces driving change in startup funding: it&apos;s
becoming cheaper to start a startup, and startups are becoming a
more normal thing to do.<br><br>When I graduated from college in 1986, there were essentially two
options: get a job or go to grad school.  Now there&apos;s a third: start
your own company.
That&apos;s a big change.  In principle it was possible to start your
own company in 1986 too, but it didn&apos;t seem like a real possibility.
It seemed possible to start a consulting company, or a niche product
company, but it didn&apos;t seem possible to start a company that would
become big.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>That kind of change, from 2 paths to 3, is the sort of big social
shift that only happens once every few generations.  I think we&apos;re
still at the beginning of this one.  It&apos;s hard to predict how big
a deal it will be.  As big a deal as the Industrial Revolution?
Maybe.  Probably not.  But it will be a big enough deal that it
takes almost everyone by surprise, because those big social shifts
always do.<br><br>One thing we can say for sure is that there will be a lot more
startups.  The monolithic, hierarchical companies of the mid 20th
century are being <a href="highres.html">replaced</a> by networks
of smaller companies.  This process is not just something happening
now in Silicon Valley.  It started decades ago, and it&apos;s happening
as far afield as the car industry.  It has a long way to run. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>
The other big driver of change is that startups are becoming cheaper
to start.  And in fact the two forces are related: the decreasing
cost of starting a startup is one of the reasons startups are
becoming a more normal thing to do.<br><br>The fact that startups need less money means founders will increasingly
have the upper hand over investors.  You still need just as much
of their energy and imagination, but they don&apos;t need as much of
your money.  Because founders have the upper hand, they&apos;ll retain
an increasingly large share of the stock in, and <a href="control.html">control of</a>, their
companies.  Which means investors will get less stock and less
control.<br><br>Does that mean investors will make less money?  Not necessarily,
because there will be more good startups.  The total amount of
desirable startup stock available to investors will probably increase,
because the number of desirable startups will probably grow faster
than the percentage they sell to investors shrinks.<br><br>There&apos;s a rule of thumb in the VC business that there are about 15
companies a year that will be really successful.  Although a lot
of investors unconsciously treat this number as if it were some
sort of cosmological constant, I&apos;m certain it isn&apos;t.   There are
probably limits on the rate at which technology can develop, but
that&apos;s not the limiting factor now.  If it were, each successful
startup would be founded the month it became possible, and that is
not the case. Right now the limiting factor on the number of big
hits is the number of sufficiently good founders starting companies,
and that number can and will increase.  There are still a lot of
people who&apos;d make great founders who never end up starting a company.
You can see that from how randomly some of the most successful
startups got started.  So many of the biggest startups almost didn&apos;t
happen that there must be a lot of equally good startups that
actually didn&apos;t happen.<br><br>There might be 10x or even 50x more good founders out there.  As
more of them go ahead and start startups, those 15 big hits a year
could easily become 50 or even 100.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>What about returns, though?  Are we heading for a world in which
returns will be pinched by increasingly high valuations?  I think
the top firms will actually make more money than they have in the
past.  High returns don&apos;t come from investing at low valuations.
They come from investing in the companies that do really well.  So
if there are more of those to be had each year, the best pickers
should have more hits.<br><br>This means there should be more variability in the VC business.
The firms that can recognize and attract the best startups will do
even better, because there will be more of them to recognize and
attract.  Whereas the bad firms will get the leftovers, as they do
now, and yet pay a higher price for them.<br><br>Nor do I think it will be a problem that founders keep control of
their companies for longer.  The empirical evidence on that is
already clear: investors make more money as founders&apos; bitches than
their bosses.  Though somewhat humiliating, this is actually good
news for investors, because it takes less time to serve founders
than to micromanage them.<br><br>What about angels?  I think there is a lot of opportunity there.
It used to suck to be an angel investor.  You couldn&apos;t get access
to the best deals, unless you got lucky like Andy Bechtolsheim, and
when you did invest in a startup, VCs might try to strip you of
your stock when they arrived later.  Now an angel can go to something
like Demo Day or AngelList and have access to the same deals VCs
do.  And the days when VCs could wash angels out of the cap table
are long gone.<br><br>I think one of the biggest unexploited opportunities in startup
investing right now is angel-sized investments made quickly.  Few
investors understand the cost that raising money from them imposes
on startups.  When the company consists only of the founders,
everything grinds to a halt during fundraising, which can easily
take 6 weeks.  The current high cost of fundraising means there is
room for low-cost investors to undercut the rest.  And in this
context, low-cost means deciding quickly.  If there were a reputable
investor who invested $100k on good terms and promised to decide
yes or no within 24 hours, they&apos;d get access to almost all the best
deals, because every good startup would approach them first.  It
would be up to them to pick, because every bad startup would approach
them first too, but at least they&apos;d see everything.  Whereas if an
investor is notorious for taking a long time to make up their mind
or negotiating a lot about valuation, founders will save them for
last.  And in the case of the most promising startups, which tend
to have an easy time raising money, last can easily become never.<br><br>Will the number of big hits grow linearly with the total number of
new startups?  Probably not, for two reasons.  One is that the
scariness of starting a startup in the old days was a pretty effective
filter.  Now that the cost of failing is becoming lower, we should
expect founders to do it more.  That&apos;s not a bad thing.  It&apos;s common
in technology for an innovation that decreases the cost of failure
to increase the number of failures and yet leave you net ahead.<br><br>The other reason the number of big hits won&apos;t grow proportionately
to the number of startups is that there will start to be an increasing
number of idea clashes.  Although the finiteness of the number of
good ideas is not the reason there are only 15 big hits a year, the
number has to be finite, and the more startups there are, the more
we&apos;ll see multiple companies doing the same thing at the same time.
It will be interesting, in a bad way, if idea clashes become a lot
more common. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Mostly because of the increasing number of early failures, the startup
business of the future won&apos;t simply be the same shape, scaled up.
What used to be an obelisk will become a pyramid.  It will be a
little wider at the top, but a lot wider at the bottom.<br><br>What does that mean for investors?  One thing it means is that there
will be more opportunities for investors at the earliest stage,
because that&apos;s where the volume of our imaginary solid is growing
fastest.  Imagine the obelisk of investors that corresponds to
the obelisk of startups.  As it widens out into a pyramid to match
the startup pyramid, all the contents are adhering to the top,
leaving a vacuum at the bottom.<br><br>That opportunity for investors mostly means an opportunity for new
investors, because the degree of risk an existing investor or firm
is comfortable taking is one of the hardest things for them to
change.  Different types of investors are adapted to different
degrees of risk, but each has its specific degree of risk deeply
imprinted on it, not just in the procedures they follow but in the
personalities of the people who work there.<br><br>I think the biggest danger for VCs, and also the biggest opportunity,
is at the series A stage.  Or rather, what used to be the series A
stage before series As turned into de facto series B rounds.<br><br>Right now, VCs often knowingly invest too much money at the series
A stage.  They do it because they feel they need to get a big chunk
of each series A company to compensate for the opportunity cost of
the board seat it consumes.  Which means when there is a lot of
competition for a deal, the number that moves is the valuation (and
thus amount invested) rather than the percentage of the company
being sold.  Which means, especially in the case of more promising
startups, that series A investors often make companies take more
money than they want.<br><br>Some VCs lie and claim the company really needs that much.  Others
are more candid, and admit their financial models require them to
own a certain percentage of each company.  But we all know the
amounts being raised in series A rounds are not determined by asking
what would be best for the companies.  They&apos;re determined by VCs
starting from the amount of the company they want to own, and the
market setting the valuation and thus the amount invested.<br><br>Like a lot of bad things, this didn&apos;t happen intentionally.  The
VC business backed into it as their initial assumptions gradually
became obsolete.  The traditions and financial models of the VC
business were established when founders needed investors more.  In
those days it was natural for founders to sell VCs a big chunk of
their company in the series A round.  Now founders would prefer to
sell less, and VCs are digging in their heels because they&apos;re not
sure if they can make money buying less than 20% of each series A
company.<br><br>The reason I describe this as a danger is that series A investors
are increasingly at odds with the startups they supposedly serve,
and that tends to come back to bite you eventually.  The reason I
describe it as an opportunity is that there is now a lot of potential
energy built up, as the market has moved away from VCs&apos; traditional
business model.  Which means the first VC to break ranks and start
to do series A rounds for as much equity as founders want to sell
(and with no &quot;option pool&quot; that comes only from the founders&apos; shares)
stands to reap huge benefits.<br><br>What will happen to the VC business when that happens?  Hell if I
know.  But I bet that particular firm will end up ahead.  If one
top-tier VC firm started to do series A rounds that started from
the amount the company needed to raise and let the percentage
acquired vary with the market, instead of the other way around,
they&apos;d instantly get almost all the best startups.  And that&apos;s where
the money is.<br><br>You can&apos;t fight market forces forever.  Over the last decade we&apos;ve
seen the percentage of the company sold in series A rounds creep
inexorably downward.  40% used to be common.  Now VCs are fighting
to hold the line at 20%.  But I am daily waiting for the line to
collapse.  It&apos;s going to happen.  You may as well anticipate it,
and look bold.<br><br>Who knows, maybe VCs will make more money by doing the right thing.
It wouldn&apos;t be the first time that happened.  Venture capital is a
business where occasional big successes generate hundredfold returns.
How much confidence can you really have in financial models for
something like that anyway?  The
big successes only have to get a tiny bit less occasional to
compensate for a 2x decrease in the stock sold in series A rounds.<br><br>If you want to find new opportunities for investing, look for things
founders complain about.  Founders are your customers, and the
things they complain about are unsatisfied demand.  I&apos;ve given two
examples of things founders complain about most&#x2014;investors who
take too long to make up their minds, and excessive dilution in
series A rounds&#x2014;so those are good places to look now.  But
the more general recipe is: do something founders want.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I realize revenue and not fundraising is the proper test of
success for a startup.  The reason we quote statistics about
fundraising is because those are the numbers we have.  We couldn&apos;t
talk meaningfully about revenues without including the numbers from
the most successful startups, and we don&apos;t have those.  We often
discuss revenue growth with the earlier stage startups, because
that&apos;s how we gauge their progress, but when companies reach a
certain size it gets presumptuous for a seed investor to do that.<br><br>In any case, companies&apos; market caps do eventually become a function
of revenues, and post-money valuations of funding rounds are at
least guesses by pros about where those market caps will end up.<br><br>The reason only 287 have valuations is that the rest have mostly
raised money on convertible notes, and although convertible notes
often have valuation caps, a valuation cap is merely an upper bound
on a valuation.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
We didn&apos;t try to accept a particular number.  We have no way
of doing that even if we wanted to.  We just tried to be significantly
pickier.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Though you never know with bottlenecks, I&apos;m guessing the next
one will be coordinating efforts among partners.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
I realize starting a company doesn&apos;t have to mean starting a
<a href="growth.html">startup</a>.  There will be lots of people starting normal companies
too.  But that&apos;s not relevant to an audience of investors.<br><br>Geoff Ralston reports that in Silicon Valley it seemed thinkable
to start a startup in the mid 1980s.  It would have started there.
But I know it didn&apos;t to undergraduates on the East Coast.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
This trend is one of the main causes of the increase in
economic inequality in the US since the mid twentieth century.  The
person who would in 1950 have been the general manager of the x
division of Megacorp is now the founder of the x company, and owns
significant equity in it.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
If Congress passes the <a href="foundervisa.html">founder
visa</a> in a non-broken form, that alone could in principle get
us up to 20x, since 95% of the world&apos;s population lives outside the
US.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
If idea clashes got bad enough, it could change what it means
to be a startup.  We currently advise startups mostly to ignore
competitors.  We tell them startups are competitive like running,
not like soccer; you don&apos;t have to go and steal the ball away from
the other team.  But if idea clashes became common enough, maybe
you&apos;d start to have to.  That would be unfortunate.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Dalton Caldwell,

<p>
July 2013<br><br>One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is
to do things that don&apos;t scale.  A lot of would-be founders believe
that startups either take off or don&apos;t.  You build something, make
it available, and if you&apos;ve made a better mousetrap, people beat a
path to your door as promised.  Or they don&apos;t, in which case the
market must not exist.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off.
There may be a handful that just grew by themselves, but usually
it takes some sort of push to get them going.  A good metaphor would
be the cranks that car engines had before they got electric starters.
Once the engine was going, it would keep going, but there was a
separate and laborious process to get it going.<br><br><b>Recruit</b><br><br>The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start
is to recruit users manually.  Nearly all startups have to.  You
can&apos;t wait for users to come to you.  You have to go out and get
them.<br><br>Stripe is one of the most successful startups we&apos;ve funded, and the
problem they solved was an urgent one.   If anyone could have sat
back and waited for users, it was Stripe.  But in fact they&apos;re
famous within YC for aggressive early user acquisition.<br><br>Startups building things for other startups have a big pool of
potential users in the other companies we&apos;ve funded, and none took
better advantage of it than Stripe.  At YC we use the term &quot;Collison
installation&quot; for the technique they invented.  More diffident
founders ask &quot;Will you try our beta?&quot; and if the answer is yes,
they say &quot;Great, we&apos;ll send you a link.&quot;  But the Collison brothers
weren&apos;t going to wait. When anyone agreed to try Stripe they&apos;d say
&quot;Right then, give me your laptop&quot; and set them up on the spot.<br><br>There are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting users
individually.  One is a combination of shyness and laziness.  They&apos;d
rather sit at home writing code than go out and talk to a bunch of
strangers and probably be rejected by most of them.  But for a
startup to succeed, at least one founder (usually the CEO) will
have to spend a lot of time on sales and marketing.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The other reason founders ignore this path is that the absolute
numbers seem so small at first.  This can&apos;t be how the big, famous
startups got started, they think. The mistake they make is to
underestimate the power of compound growth.  We encourage every
startup to measure their progress by weekly <a href="growth.html">growth
rate</a>.  If you have 100 users, you need to get 10 more next week
to grow 10% a week.  And while 110 may not seem much better than
100, if you keep growing at 10% a week you&apos;ll be surprised how big
the numbers get.  After a year you&apos;ll have 14,000 users, and after
2 years you&apos;ll have 2 million.<br><br>You&apos;ll be doing different things when you&apos;re acquiring users a
thousand at a time, and growth has to slow down eventually.  But
if the market exists you can usually start by recruiting users
manually and then gradually switch to less manual methods. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Airbnb is a classic example of this technique.  Marketplaces are
so hard to get rolling that you should expect to take heroic measures
at first. In Airbnb&apos;s case, these consisted of going door to door
in New York, recruiting new users and helping existing ones improve
their listings.  When I remember the Airbnbs during YC, I picture
them with rolly bags, because when they showed up for tuesday dinners
they&apos;d always just flown back from somewhere.<br><br><b>Fragile</b><br><br>Airbnb now seems like an unstoppable juggernaut, but early on it
was so fragile that about 30 days of going out and engaging in
person with users made the difference between success and failure.<br><br>That initial fragility was not a unique feature of Airbnb.  Almost
all startups are fragile initially.  And that&apos;s one of the biggest
things inexperienced founders and investors (and reporters and
know-it-alls on forums) get wrong about them.  They unconsciously
judge larval startups by the standards of established ones.  They&apos;re
like someone looking at a newborn baby and concluding &quot;there&apos;s no
way this tiny creature could ever accomplish anything.&quot;<br><br>It&apos;s harmless if reporters and know-it-alls dismiss your startup.
They always get things wrong.   It&apos;s even ok if investors dismiss
your startup; they&apos;ll change their minds when they see growth.  The
big danger is that you&apos;ll dismiss your startup yourself.  I&apos;ve seen
it happen.  I often have to encourage founders who don&apos;t see the
full potential of what they&apos;re building.  Even Bill Gates made that
mistake.  He returned to Harvard for the fall semester after starting
Microsoft.  He didn&apos;t stay long, but he wouldn&apos;t have returned at
all if he&apos;d realized Microsoft was going to be even a fraction of
the size it turned out to be. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>The question to ask about an early stage startup is not &quot;is this
company taking over the world?&quot;  but &quot;how big could this company
get if the founders did the right things?&quot;  And the right things
often seem both laborious and inconsequential at the time. Microsoft
can&apos;t have seemed very impressive when it was just a couple guys
in Albuquerque writing Basic interpreters for a market of a few
thousand hobbyists (as they were then called), but in retrospect
that was the optimal path to dominating microcomputer software.
And I know Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia didn&apos;t feel like they were
en route to the big time as they were taking &quot;professional&quot; photos
of their first hosts&apos; apartments.  They were just trying to survive.
But in retrospect that too was the optimal path to dominating a big
market.<br><br>How do you find users to recruit manually?  If you build something
to solve <a href="startupideas.html">your own problems</a>, then
you only have to find your peers, which is usually straightforward.
Otherwise you&apos;ll have to make a more deliberate effort to locate
the most promising vein of users.  The usual way to do that is to
get some initial set of users by doing a comparatively untargeted
launch, and then to observe which kind seem most enthusiastic, and
seek out more like them.  For example, Ben Silbermann noticed that
a lot of the earliest Pinterest users were interested in design,
so he went to a conference of design bloggers to recruit users, and
that worked well. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Delight</b><br><br>You should take extraordinary measures not just to acquire users,
but also to make them happy.  For as long as they could (which
turned out to be surprisingly long), Wufoo sent each new user a
hand-written thank you note.  Your first users should feel that
signing up with you was one of the best choices they ever made.
And you in turn should be racking your brains to think of new ways
to delight them.<br><br>Why do we have to teach startups this?  Why is it counterintuitive
for founders?  Three reasons, I think.<br><br>One is that a lot of startup founders are trained as engineers,
and customer service is not part of the training of engineers.
You&apos;re supposed to build things that are robust and elegant, not
be slavishly attentive to individual users like some kind of
salesperson.  Ironically, part of the reason engineering is
traditionally averse to handholding is that its traditions date
from a time when engineers were less powerful&#x2014;when they were
only in charge of their narrow domain of building things, rather
than running the whole show.  You can be ornery when you&apos;re Scotty,
but not when you&apos;re Kirk.<br><br>Another reason founders don&apos;t focus enough on individual customers
is that they worry it won&apos;t scale.  But when founders of larval
startups worry about this, I point out that in their current state
they have nothing to lose.  Maybe if they go out of their way to
make existing users super happy, they&apos;ll one day have too many to
do so much for.  That would be a great problem to have.  See if you
can make it happen.  And incidentally, when it does, you&apos;ll find
that delighting customers scales better than you expected.  Partly
because you can usually find ways to make anything scale more than
you would have predicted, and partly because delighting customers
will by then have permeated your culture.<br><br>I have never once seen a startup lured down a blind alley by trying
too hard to make their initial users happy.<br><br>But perhaps the biggest thing preventing founders from realizing
how attentive they could be to their users is that they&apos;ve never
experienced such attention themselves.  Their standards for customer
service have been set by the companies they&apos;ve been customers of,
which are mostly big ones.  Tim Cook doesn&apos;t send you a hand-written
note after you buy a laptop.  He can&apos;t.  But you can.  That&apos;s one
advantage of being small: you can provide a level of service no big
company can. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Once you realize that existing conventions are not the upper bound
on user experience, it&apos;s interesting in a very pleasant way to think
about how far you could go to delight your users.<br><br><b>Experience</b><br><br>I was trying to think of a phrase to convey how extreme your attention
to users should be, and I realized Steve Jobs had already done it:
insanely great.  Steve wasn&apos;t just using &quot;insanely&quot; as a synonym
for &quot;very.&quot;  He meant it more literally&#x2014;that one should focus
on quality of execution to a degree that in everyday life would be
considered pathological.<br><br>All the most successful startups we&apos;ve funded have, and that probably
doesn&apos;t surprise would-be founders.  What novice founders don&apos;t get
is what insanely great translates to in a larval startup.  When
Steve Jobs started using that phrase, Apple was already an established
company.  He meant the Mac (and its documentation and even
packaging&#x2014;such is the nature of obsession) should be insanely
well designed and manufactured.  That&apos;s not hard for engineers to
grasp.  It&apos;s just a more extreme version of designing a robust and
elegant product.<br><br>What founders have a hard time grasping (and Steve himself might
have had a hard time grasping) is what insanely great morphs into
as you roll the time slider back to the first couple months of a
startup&apos;s life.  It&apos;s not the product that should be insanely great,
but the experience of being your user.  The product is just one
component of that.  For a big company it&apos;s necessarily the dominant
one.  But you can and should give users an insanely great experience
with an early, incomplete, buggy product, if you make up the
difference with attentiveness.<br><br>Can, perhaps, but should?  Yes.  Over-engaging with early users is
not just a permissible technique for getting growth rolling.  For
most successful startups it&apos;s a necessary part of the feedback loop
that makes the product good.  Making a better mousetrap is not an
atomic operation.  Even if you start the way most successful startups
have, by building something you yourself need, the first thing you
build is never quite right.  And except in domains with big penalties
for making mistakes, it&apos;s often better not to aim for perfection
initially.  In software, especially, it usually works best to get
something in front of users as soon as it has a quantum of utility,
and then see what they do with it.  Perfectionism is often an excuse
for procrastination, and in any case your initial model of users
is always inaccurate, even if you&apos;re one of them. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>The feedback you get from engaging directly with your earliest users
will be the best you ever get.  When you&apos;re so big you have to
resort to focus groups, you&apos;ll wish you could go over to your users&apos;
homes and offices and watch them use your stuff like you did when
there were only a handful of them.<br><br><b>Fire</b><br><br>Sometimes the right unscalable trick is to focus on a deliberately
narrow market.  It&apos;s like keeping a fire contained at first to get
it really hot before adding more logs.<br><br>That&apos;s what Facebook did.  At first it was just for Harvard students.
In that form it only had a potential market of a few thousand people,
but because they felt it was really for them, a critical mass of
them signed up.  After Facebook stopped being for Harvard students,
it remained for students at specific colleges for quite a while.
When I interviewed Mark Zuckerberg at Startup School, he said that
while it was a lot of work creating course lists for each school,
doing that made students feel the site was their natural home.<br><br>Any startup that could be described as a marketplace usually has
to start in a subset of the market, but this can work for other
startups as well.  It&apos;s always worth asking if there&apos;s a subset of
the market in which you can get a critical mass of users quickly.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>Most startups that use the contained fire strategy do it unconsciously.
They build something for themselves and their friends, who happen
to be the early adopters, and only realize later that they could
offer it to a broader market.  The strategy works just as well if
you do it unconsciously.  The biggest danger of not being consciously
aware of this pattern is for those who naively discard part of it.
E.g. if you don&apos;t build something for yourself and your friends,
or even if you do, but you come from the corporate world and your
friends are not early adopters, you&apos;ll no longer have a perfect
initial market handed to you on a platter.<br><br>Among companies, the best early adopters are usually other startups.
They&apos;re more open to new things both by nature and because, having
just been started, they haven&apos;t made all their choices yet.  Plus
when they succeed they grow fast, and you with them.  It was one
of many unforeseen advantages of the YC model (and specifically of
making YC big) that B2B startups now have an instant market of
hundreds of other startups ready at hand.<br><br><b>Meraki</b><br><br>For <a href="hw.html">hardware startups</a> there&apos;s a variant of
doing things that don&apos;t scale that we call &quot;pulling a Meraki.&quot;
Although we didn&apos;t fund Meraki, the founders were Robert Morris&apos;s
grad students, so we know their history.  They got started by doing
something that really doesn&apos;t scale: assembling their routers
themselves.<br><br>Hardware startups face an obstacle that software startups don&apos;t.
The minimum order for a factory production run is usually several
hundred thousand dollars.  Which can put you in a catch-22: without
a product you can&apos;t generate the growth you need to raise the money
to manufacture your product.  Back when hardware startups had to
rely on investors for money, you had to be pretty convincing to
overcome this.  The arrival of crowdfunding (or more precisely,
preorders) has helped a lot.  But even so I&apos;d advise startups to
pull a Meraki initially if they can.  That&apos;s what Pebble did.  The
Pebbles 
<a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/eric.jpg">assembled</a>
 the first several hundred watches themselves. If
they hadn&apos;t gone through that phase, they probably wouldn&apos;t have
sold $10 million worth of watches when they did go on Kickstarter.<br><br>Like paying excessive attention to early customers, fabricating
things yourself turns out to be valuable for hardware startups.
You can tweak the design faster when you&apos;re the factory, and you
learn things you&apos;d never have known otherwise.  Eric Migicovsky of
Pebble said one of things he learned was &quot;how valuable it was to
source good screws.&quot;   Who knew?<br><br><b>Consult</b><br><br>Sometimes we advise founders of B2B startups to take over-engagement
to an extreme, and to pick a single user and act as if they were
consultants building something just for that one user.   The initial
user serves as the form for your mold; keep tweaking till you fit
their needs perfectly, and you&apos;ll usually find you&apos;ve made something
other users want too.  Even if there aren&apos;t many of them, there are
probably adjacent territories that have more.  As long as you can
find just one user who really needs something and can act on that
need, you&apos;ve got a toehold in making something people want, and
that&apos;s as much as any startup needs initially. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>Consulting is the canonical example of work that doesn&apos;t scale.
But (like other ways of bestowing one&apos;s favors liberally) it&apos;s safe
to do it so long as you&apos;re not being paid to.  That&apos;s where companies
cross the line.  So long as you&apos;re a product company that&apos;s merely
being extra attentive to a customer, they&apos;re very grateful even if
you don&apos;t solve all their problems.  But when they start paying you
specifically for that attentiveness&#x2014;when they start paying
you by the hour&#x2014;they expect you to do everything.<br><br>Another consulting-like technique for recruiting initially lukewarm
users is to use your software yourselves on their behalf.  We
did that at Viaweb.  When we approached merchants asking if they
wanted to use our software to make online stores, some said no, but
they&apos;d let us make one for them.  Since we would do anything to get
users, we did.  We felt pretty lame at the time.  Instead of
organizing big strategic e-commerce partnerships, we were trying
to sell luggage and pens and men&apos;s shirts.  But in retrospect it
was exactly the right thing to do, because it taught us how it would
feel to merchants to use our software.  Sometimes the feedback loop
was near instantaneous: in the middle of building some merchant&apos;s
site I&apos;d find I needed a feature we didn&apos;t have, so I&apos;d spend a
couple hours implementing it and then resume building the site.<br><br><b>Manual</b><br><br>There&apos;s a more extreme variant where you don&apos;t just use your software,
but are your software.  When you only have a small number of users,
you can sometimes get away with doing by hand things that you plan
to automate later.  This lets you launch faster, and when you do
finally automate yourself out of the loop, you&apos;ll know exactly what
to build because you&apos;ll have muscle memory from doing it yourself.<br><br>When manual components look to the user like software, this technique
starts to have aspects of a practical joke.  For example, the way
Stripe delivered &quot;instant&quot; merchant accounts to its first users was
that the founders manually signed them up for traditional merchant
accounts behind the scenes.<br><br>Some startups could be entirely manual at first. If you can find
someone with a problem that needs solving and you can solve it
manually, go ahead and do that for as long as you can, and then
gradually automate the bottlenecks.  It would be a little frightening
to be solving users&apos; problems in a way that wasn&apos;t yet automatic,
but less frightening than the far more common case of having something
automatic that doesn&apos;t yet solve anyone&apos;s problems.<br><br><b>Big</b><br><br>I should mention one sort of initial tactic that usually doesn&apos;t
work: the Big Launch.  I occasionally meet founders who seem to
believe startups are projectiles rather than powered aircraft, and
that they&apos;ll make it big if and only if they&apos;re launched with
sufficient initial velocity.  They want to launch simultaneously
in 8 different publications, with embargoes.  And on a tuesday, of
course, since they read somewhere that&apos;s the optimum day to launch
something.<br><br>It&apos;s easy to see how little launches matter.  Think of some successful
startups.  How many of their launches do you remember?
All you need from a launch is some initial core of users.  How well
you&apos;re doing a few months later will depend more on how happy you
made those users than how many there were of them.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>So why do founders think launches matter?  A combination of solipsism
and laziness.  They think what they&apos;re building is so great that
everyone who hears about it will immediately sign up.  Plus it would
be so much less work if you could get users merely by broadcasting
your existence, rather than recruiting them one at a time.  But
even if what you&apos;re building really is great, getting users will
always be a gradual process&#x2014;partly because great things
are usually also novel, but mainly because users have other things
to think about.<br><br>Partnerships too usually don&apos;t work.  They don&apos;t work for startups
in general, but they especially don&apos;t work as a way to get growth
started.  It&apos;s a common mistake among inexperienced founders to
believe that a partnership with a big company will be their big
break.  Six months later they&apos;re all saying the same thing: that
was way more work than we expected, and we ended up getting practically
nothing out of it. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>It&apos;s not enough just to do something extraordinary initially.  You
have to make an extraordinary <i>effort</i> initially.  Any strategy
that omits the effort&#x2014;whether it&apos;s expecting a big launch to
get you users, or a big partner&#x2014;is ipso facto suspect.<br><br><b>Vector</b><br><br>The need to do something unscalably laborious to get started is so
nearly universal that it might be a good idea to stop thinking of
startup ideas as scalars.  Instead we should try thinking of them
as pairs of what you&apos;re going to build, plus the unscalable thing(s)
you&apos;re going to do initially to get the company going.<br><br>It could be interesting to start viewing startup ideas this way,
because now that there are two components you can try to be imaginative
about the second as well as the first.  But in most cases the second
component will be what it usually is&#x2014;recruit users manually
and give them an overwhelmingly good experience&#x2014;and the main
benefit of treating startups as vectors will be to remind founders
they need to work hard in two dimensions.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>In the best case, both components of the vector contribute to your
company&apos;s DNA: the unscalable things you have to do to get started
are not merely a necessary evil, but change the company permanently
for the better.  If you have to be aggressive about user acquisition
when you&apos;re small, you&apos;ll probably still be aggressive when you&apos;re
big.  If you have to manufacture your own hardware, or use your
software on users&apos;s behalf, you&apos;ll learn things you couldn&apos;t have
learned otherwise.  And most importantly, if you have to work hard
to delight users when you only have a handful of them, you&apos;ll keep
doing it when you have a lot.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Actually Emerson never mentioned mousetraps specifically.  He
wrote &quot;If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell,
or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs,
than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his
house, though it be in the woods.&quot;<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Thanks to Sam Altman for suggesting I make this explicit.
And no, you can&apos;t avoid doing sales by hiring someone to do it for
you.  You have to do sales yourself initially.  Later you can hire
a real salesperson to replace you.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The reason this works is that as you get bigger, your size
helps you grow.  Patrick Collison wrote &quot;At some point, there was

its own momentum.&quot;<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
One of the more subtle ways in which YC can help founders
is by calibrating their ambitions, because we know exactly how a

If you&apos;re building something for which you can&apos;t easily get
a small set of users to observe&#x2014;e.g. enterprise software&#x2014;and
in a domain where you have no connections, you&apos;ll have to rely on
cold calls and introductions.  But should you even be working on
such an idea?<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Garry Tan pointed out an interesting trap founders fall into
in the beginning.  They want so much to seem big that they imitate
even the flaws of big companies, like indifference to individual
users.  This seems to them more &quot;professional.&quot;  Actually it&apos;s
better to embrace the fact that you&apos;re small and use whatever
advantages that brings.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Your user model almost couldn&apos;t be perfectly accurate, because
users&apos; needs often change in response to what you build for them.
Build them a microcomputer, and suddenly they need to run spreadsheets
on it, because the arrival of your new microcomputer causes someone
to invent the spreadsheet.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
If you have to choose between the subset that will sign up
quickest and those that will pay the most, it&apos;s usually best to
pick the former, because those are probably the early adopters.
They&apos;ll have a better influence on your product, and they won&apos;t
make you expend as much effort on sales.  And though they have less
money, you don&apos;t need that much to maintain your target growth rate
early on.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Yes, I can imagine cases where you could end up making
something that was really only useful for one user.  But those are
usually obvious, even to inexperienced founders.  So if it&apos;s not
obvious you&apos;d be making something for a market of one, don&apos;t worry
about that danger.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
There may even be an inverse correlation between launch
magnitude and success.  The only launches I remember are famous
flops like the Segway and Google Wave.  Wave is a particularly
alarming example, because I think it was actually a great idea that
was killed partly by its overdone launch.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
Google grew big on the back of Yahoo, but that wasn&apos;t a
partnership.  Yahoo was their customer.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
It will also remind founders that an idea where the second
component is empty&#x2014;an idea where there is nothing you can do
to get going, e.g. because you have no way to find users to recruit

<p>
August 2013<br><br>When people hurt themselves lifting heavy things, it&apos;s usually
because they try to lift with their back.  The right way to lift
heavy things is to let your legs do the work.  Inexperienced founders
make the same mistake when trying to convince investors.  They try
to convince with their pitch.  Most would be better off if they let
their startup do the work&#x2014;if they started by understanding why
their startup is worth investing in, then simply explained this
well to investors.<br><br>Investors are looking for startups that will be very successful.
But that test is not as simple as it sounds.  In startups, as in a
lot of other domains, the distribution of outcomes follows a power
law, but in startups the curve is startlingly steep.  The big
successes are so big they 
<a href="swan.html">dwarf</a> the rest.  And since there are only
a handful each year (the conventional wisdom is 15), investors treat
&quot;big success&quot; as if it were binary.  Most are interested in you if
you seem like you have a chance, however small, of being one of the
15 big successes, and otherwise not.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>(There are a handful of angels who&apos;d be interested in a company
with a high probability of being moderately successful.  But angel
investors like big successes too.)<br><br>How do you seem like you&apos;ll be one of the big successes?  You need
three things: formidable founders, a promising market, and (usually)
some evidence of success so far.<br><br><b>Formidable</b><br><br>The most important ingredient is formidable founders.  Most investors
decide in the first few minutes whether you seem like a winner or
a loser, and once their opinion is set it&apos;s hard to change.&#xA0;<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Every startup has reasons both to invest and not to invest.  If
investors think you&apos;re a winner they focus on the former, and if
not they focus on the latter.  For example, it might be a rich
market, but with a slow sales cycle.  If investors are impressed
with you as founders, they say they want to invest because it&apos;s a
rich market, and if not, they say they can&apos;t invest because of the
slow sales cycle.<br><br>They&apos;re not necessarily trying to mislead you.  Most investors are
genuinely unclear in their own minds why they like or dislike
startups.  If you seem like a winner, they&apos;ll like your idea more.
But don&apos;t be too smug about this weakness of theirs, because you
have it too; almost everyone does.<br><br>There is a role for ideas of course.  They&apos;re fuel for the fire
that starts with liking the founders.  Once investors like you,
you&apos;ll see them reaching for ideas: they&apos;ll be saying &quot;yes, and you
could also do x.&quot;  (Whereas when they don&apos;t like you, they&apos;ll be
saying &quot;but what about x?&quot;)<br><br>But the foundation of convincing investors is to seem formidable,
and since this isn&apos;t a word most people use in conversation much,
I should explain what it means.  A formidable person is one who
seems like they&apos;ll get what they want, regardless of whatever
obstacles are in the way.  Formidable is close to confident, except
that someone could be confident and mistaken.  Formidable is roughly
justifiably confident.<br><br>There are a handful of people who are really good at seeming
formidable&#x2014;some because they actually are very formidable and
just let it show, and others because they are more or less con
artists.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
But most founders, including many who will go on
to start very successful companies, are not that good at seeming
formidable the first time they try fundraising.  What should they
do?
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>What they should not do is try to imitate the swagger of more
experienced founders.  Investors are not always that good at judging
technology, but they&apos;re good at judging confidence.  If you try to
act like something you&apos;re not, you&apos;ll just end up in an uncanny
valley.  You&apos;ll depart from sincere, but never arrive at convincing.<br><br><b>Truth</b><br><br>The way to seem most formidable as an inexperienced founder is to
stick to the truth.   How formidable you seem isn&apos;t a constant.  It
varies depending on what you&apos;re saying.  Most people can seem
confident when they&apos;re saying &quot;one plus one is two,&quot; because they
know it&apos;s true.  The most diffident person would be puzzled and
even slightly contemptuous if they told a VC &quot;one plus one is two&quot;
and the VC reacted with skepticism.  The magic ability of people
who are good at seeming formidable is that they can do this with
the sentence &quot;we&apos;re going to make a billion dollars a year.&quot;  But
you can do the same, if not with that sentence with some fairly
impressive ones, so long as you convince yourself first.<br><br>That&apos;s the secret.  Convince yourself that your startup is worth
investing in, and then when you explain this to investors they&apos;ll
believe you.  And by convince yourself, I don&apos;t mean play mind games
with yourself to boost your confidence.  I mean truly evaluate
whether your startup is worth investing in.  If it isn&apos;t, don&apos;t try
to raise money.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
But if it is, you&apos;ll be telling the truth
when you tell investors it&apos;s worth investing in, and they&apos;ll sense
that.  You don&apos;t have to be a smooth presenter if you understand
something well and tell the truth about it.<br><br>To evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in, you have
to be a domain expert.  If you&apos;re not a domain expert, you can be
as convinced as you like about your idea, and it will seem to
investors no more than an instance of the Dunning-Kruger effect.
Which in fact it will usually be.  And investors can tell fairly
quickly whether you&apos;re a domain expert by how well you answer their
questions.  Know everything about your market.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Why do founders persist in trying to convince investors of things
they&apos;re not convinced of themselves?  Partly because we&apos;ve all been
trained to.<br><br>When my friends Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell were in grad
school, one of their fellow students was on the receiving end of a
question from their faculty advisor that we still quote today.  When
the unfortunate fellow got to his last slide, the professor burst
out:
<blockquote>
  Which one of these conclusions do you actually believe?
</blockquote>
One of the artifacts of the way schools are organized is that we
all get trained to talk even when we have nothing to say.  If you
have a ten page paper due, then ten pages you must write, even if
you only have one page of ideas.  Even if you have no ideas.  You
have to produce something.  And all too many startups go into
fundraising in the same spirit.  When they think it&apos;s time to raise
money, they try gamely to make the best case they can for their
startup.  Most never think of pausing beforehand to ask whether
what they&apos;re saying is actually convincing, because they&apos;ve all
been trained to treat the need to present as a given&#x2014;as an area
of fixed size, over which however much truth they have must needs
be spread, however thinly.<br><br>The time to raise money is not when you need it, or when you reach
some artificial deadline like a Demo Day.  It&apos;s when you can convince
investors, and not before. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>And unless you&apos;re a good con artist, you&apos;ll never convince investors
if you&apos;re not convinced yourself.  They&apos;re far better at detecting
bullshit than you are at producing it, even if you&apos;re producing it
unknowingly.  If you try convincing investors before you&apos;ve convinced
yourself, you&apos;ll be wasting both your time.<br><br>But pausing first to convince yourself will do more than save you
from wasting your time.  It will force you to organize your thoughts.
To convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, you&apos;ll
have to figure out why it&apos;s worth investing in.   And if you can
do that you&apos;ll end up with more than added confidence.  You&apos;ll also
have a provisional roadmap of how to succeed.<br><br><b>Market</b><br><br>Notice I&apos;ve been careful to talk about whether a startup is worth
investing in, rather than whether it&apos;s going to succeed.  No one
knows whether a startup is going to succeed.  And it&apos;s a good thing
for investors that this is so, because if you could know in advance
whether a startup would succeed, the stock price would already be
the future price, and there would be no room for investors to make
money.  Startup investors know that every investment is a bet, and
against pretty long odds.<br><br>So to prove you&apos;re worth investing in, you don&apos;t have to prove
you&apos;re going to succeed, just that you&apos;re a sufficiently good bet.
What makes a startup a sufficiently good bet?  In addition to
formidable founders, you need a plausible path to owning a big piece
of a big market.  Founders think of startups as ideas, but investors
think of them as markets.  If there are x number of customers who&apos;d
pay an average of $y per year for what you&apos;re making, then the total
addressable market, or TAM, of your company is $xy.  Investors don&apos;t
expect you to collect all that money, but it&apos;s an upper bound on
how big you can get.<br><br>Your target market has to be big, and it also has to be capturable
by you.  But the market doesn&apos;t have to be big yet, nor do you
necessarily have to be in it yet.  Indeed, it&apos;s often better to
start in a <a href="ds.html">small</a> market that will either turn into a big one or
from which you can move into a big one.  There just has to be some
plausible sequence of hops that leads to dominating a big market a
few years down the line.<br><br>The standard of plausibility varies dramatically depending on the
age of the startup.  A three month old company at Demo Day only
needs to be a promising experiment that&apos;s worth funding to see how
it turns out.  Whereas a two year old company raising a series A
round needs to be able to show the experiment worked. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>But every company that gets really big is &quot;lucky&quot; in the sense that
their growth is due mostly to some external wave they&apos;re riding,
so to make a convincing case for becoming huge, you have to identify
some specific trend you&apos;ll benefit from.  Usually you can find this
by asking &quot;why now?&quot;  If this is such a great idea, why hasn&apos;t
someone else already done it?  Ideally the answer is that it only
recently became a good idea, because something changed, and no one
else has noticed yet.<br><br>Microsoft for example was not going to grow huge selling Basic
interpreters.  But by starting there they were perfectly poised to
expand up the stack of microcomputer software as microcomputers
grew powerful enough to support one. And microcomputers turned out
to be a really huge wave, bigger than even the most optimistic
observers would have predicted in 1975.<br><br>But while Microsoft did really well and there is thus a temptation
to think they would have seemed a great bet a few months in, they
probably didn&apos;t.  Good, but not great.  No company, however successful,
ever looks more than a pretty good bet a few months in. Microcomputers
turned out to be a big deal, and Microsoft both executed well and
got lucky.  But it was by no means obvious that this was how things
would play out.  Plenty of companies seem as good a bet a few months
in.  I don&apos;t know about startups in general, but at least half the
startups we fund could make as good a case as Microsoft could have
for being on a path to dominating a large market.  And who can
reasonably expect more of a startup than that?<br><br><b>Rejection</b><br><br>If you can make as good a case as Microsoft could have, will you
convince investors?  Not always.  A lot of VCs would have rejected
Microsoft.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font>
Certainly some rejected Google.  And getting
rejected will put you in a slightly awkward position, because as
you&apos;ll see when you start fundraising, the most common question
you&apos;ll get from investors will be &quot;who else is investing?&quot; What do
you say if you&apos;ve been fundraising for a while and no one has
committed yet? 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>The people who are really good at acting formidable often solve
this problem by giving investors the impression that while no
investors have committed yet, several are about to.  This is arguably
a permissible tactic.  It&apos;s slightly dickish of investors to care
more about who else is investing than any other aspect of your
startup, and misleading them about how far along you are with other
investors seems the complementary countermove.  It&apos;s arguably an
instance of scamming a scammer. But I don&apos;t recommend this approach
to most founders, because most founders wouldn&apos;t be able to carry
it off.  This is the single most common lie told to investors, and
you have to be really good at lying to tell members of some profession
the most common lie they&apos;re told.<br><br>If you&apos;re not a master of negotiation (and perhaps even if you are)
the best solution is to tackle the problem head-on, and to explain
why investors have turned you down and why they&apos;re mistaken.  If
you know you&apos;re on the right track, then you also know why investors
were wrong to reject you. Experienced investors are well aware that
the best ideas are also the scariest.  They all know about the VCs
who rejected Google.  If instead of seeming evasive and ashamed
about having been turned down (and thereby implicitly agreeing with
the verdict) you talk candidly about what scared investors about
you, you&apos;ll seem more confident, which they like, and you&apos;ll probably
also do a better job of presenting that aspect of your startup.  At
the very least, that worry will now be out in the open instead of
being a gotcha left to be discovered by the investors you&apos;re currently
talking to, who will be proud of and thus attached to their discovery.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>This strategy will work best with the best investors, who are both
hard to bluff and who already believe most other investors are
conventional-minded drones doomed always to miss the big outliers.
Raising money is not like applying to college, where you can assume
that if you can get into MIT, you can also get into Foobar State.
Because the best investors are much smarter than the rest, and the
best startup ideas look initially like 
<a href="startupideas.html">bad ideas</a>, it&apos;s not uncommon
for a startup to be rejected by all the VCs except the best ones.
That&apos;s what happened to Dropbox.  Y Combinator started in Boston,
and for the first 3 years we ran alternating batches in Boston and
Silicon Valley.  Because Boston investors were so few and so timid,
we used to ship Boston batches out for a second Demo Day in Silicon
Valley.  Dropbox was part of a Boston batch, which means all those
Boston investors got the first look at Dropbox, and none of them
closed the deal.  Yet another backup and syncing thing, they all
thought.  A couple weeks later, Dropbox raised a series A round
from Sequoia.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Different</b><br><br>Not understanding that investors view investments as bets combines
with the ten page paper mentality to prevent founders from even
considering the possibility of being certain of what they&apos;re saying.
They think they&apos;re trying to convince investors of something very
uncertain&#x2014;that their startup will be huge&#x2014;and convincing anyone
of something like that must obviously entail some wild feat of
salesmanship.  But in fact when you raise money you&apos;re trying to
convince investors of something so much less speculative&#x2014;whether
the company has all the elements of a good bet&#x2014;that you can
approach the problem in a qualitatively different way.  You can
convince yourself, then convince them.<br><br>And when you convince them, use the same matter-of-fact language
you used to convince yourself.  You wouldn&apos;t use vague, grandiose
marketing-speak among yourselves.  Don&apos;t use it with investors
either.  It not only doesn&apos;t work on them, but seems a mark of
incompetence.  Just be concise.  Many investors explicitly use that
as a test, reasoning (correctly) that if you can&apos;t explain your
plans concisely, you don&apos;t really understand them.  But even investors
who don&apos;t have a rule about this will be bored and frustrated by
unclear explanations.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>So here&apos;s the recipe for impressing investors when you&apos;re not already
good at seeming formidable:
<ol>
<li> Make something worth investing in.<br><br></li><li> Understand why it&apos;s worth investing in.<br><br></li><li> Explain that clearly to investors.
</li></ol>
If you&apos;re saying something you know is true, you&apos;ll seem confident
when you&apos;re saying it.  Conversely, never let pitching draw you
into bullshitting.  As long as you stay on the territory of truth,
you&apos;re strong.  Make the truth good, then just tell it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
There&apos;s no reason to believe this number is a constant.  In
fact it&apos;s our explicit goal at Y Combinator to increase it, by
encouraging people to start startups who otherwise wouldn&apos;t have.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Or more precisely, investors decide whether you&apos;re a loser
or possibly a winner.  If you seem like a winner, they may then,
depending on how much you&apos;re raising, have several more meetings
with you to test whether that initial impression holds up.<br><br>But if you seem like a loser they&apos;re done, at least for the next
year or so.  And when they decide you&apos;re a loser they usually decide
in way less than the 50 minutes they may have allotted for the first
meeting.  Which explains the astonished stories one always hears
about VC inattentiveness.  How could these people make investment
decisions well when they&apos;re checking their messages during startups&apos;
presentations?  The solution to that mystery is that they&apos;ve already
made the decision.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The two are not mutually exclusive.  There are people who are
both genuinely formidable, and also really good at acting that way.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
How can people who will go on to create giant companies not
seem formidable early on?  I think the main reason is that their
experience so far has trained them to keep their wings folded, as
it were.  Family, school, and jobs encourage cooperation, not
conquest.  And it&apos;s just as well they do, because even being Genghis
Khan is probably 99% cooperation.  But the result is that most
people emerge from the tube of their upbringing in their early
twenties compressed into the shape of the tube.  Some find they
have wings and start to spread them.  But this takes a few years.
In the beginning even they don&apos;t know yet what they&apos;re capable of.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
In fact, change what you&apos;re doing.  You&apos;re investing your own
time in your startup.  If you&apos;re not convinced that what you&apos;re
working on is a sufficiently good bet, why are you even working on
that?<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
When investors ask you a question you don&apos;t know the answer
to, the best response is neither to bluff nor give up, but instead
to explain how you&apos;d figure out the answer.  If you can work out a
preliminary answer on the spot, so much the better, but explain
that&apos;s what you&apos;re doing.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
At YC we try to ensure startups are ready to raise money on
Demo Day by encouraging them to ignore investors and instead focus
on their companies till about a week before.  That way most reach
the stage where they&apos;re sufficiently convincing well before Demo
Day.  But not all do, so we also give any startup that wants to the
option of deferring to a later Demo Day.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Founders are often surprised by how much harder it is to raise
the next round.  There is a qualitative difference in investors&apos;
attitudes.  It&apos;s like the difference between being judged as a kid
and as an adult.  The next time you raise money, it&apos;s not enough
to be promising.  You have to be delivering results.<br><br>So although it works well to show growth graphs at either stage,
investors treat them differently.  At three months, a growth graph
is mostly evidence that the founders are effective.  At two years,
it has to be evidence of a promising market and a company tuned to
exploit it.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
By this I mean that if the present day equivalent of the 3
month old Microsoft presented at a Demo Day, there would be investors
who turned them down.  Microsoft itself didn&apos;t raise outside money,
and indeed the venture business barely existed when they got started
in 1975.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
The best investors rarely care who else is investing, but
mediocre investors almost all do.  So you can use this question as
a test of investor quality.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
To use this technique, you&apos;ll have to find out why investors
who rejected you did so, or at least what they claim was the reason.
That may require asking, because investors don&apos;t always volunteer
a lot of detail.  Make it clear when you ask that you&apos;re not trying
to dispute their decision&#x2014;just that if there is some weakness in
your plans, you need to know about it.  You won&apos;t always get a real
reason out of them, but you should at least try.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
Dropbox wasn&apos;t rejected by all the East Coast VCs.  There was
one firm that wanted to invest but tried to lowball them.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
Alfred Lin points out that it&apos;s doubly important for the
explanation of a startup to be clear and concise, because it has
to convince at one remove: it has to work not just on the partner
you talk to, but when that partner re-tells it to colleagues.<br><br>We consciously optimize for this at YC.  When we work with founders
create a Demo Day pitch, the last step is to imagine how an investor
would sell it to colleagues.<br><br>

August 2013<br><br>The biggest component in most investors&apos; opinion of you is the
opinion of other investors.  Which is of course a recipe for
exponential growth.  When one investor wants to invest in you, that
makes other investors want to, which makes others want to, and so
on.<br><br>Sometimes inexperienced founders mistakenly conclude that manipulating
these forces is the essence of fundraising.  They hear stories about
stampedes to invest in successful startups, and think it&apos;s therefore
the mark of a successful startup to have this happen.  But actually
the two are not that highly correlated.  Lots of startups that cause
stampedes end up flaming out (in extreme cases, partly as a result
of the stampede), and lots of very successful startups were only
moderately popular with investors the first time they raised money.<br><br>So the point of this essay is not to explain how to create a stampede,
but merely to explain the forces that generate them.  These forces
are always at work to some degree in fundraising, and they can cause
surprising situations.  If you understand them, you can at least
avoid being surprised.<br><br>One reason investors like you more when other investors like you
is that you actually become a better investment.  Raising money
decreases the risk of failure.  Indeed, although investors hate it,
you are for this reason justified in raising your valuation for
later investors.  The investors who invested when you had no money
were taking more risk, and are entitled to higher returns.  Plus a
company that has raised money is literally more valuable.  After
you raise the first million dollars, the company is at least a
million dollars more valuable, because it&apos;s the same company as
before, plus it has a million dollars in the bank.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Beware, though, because later investors so hate to have the price
raised on them that they resist even this self-evident reasoning.
Only raise the price on an investor you&apos;re comfortable with losing,
because some will angrily refuse.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The second reason investors like you more when you&apos;ve had some
success at fundraising is that it makes you more confident, and an
investors&apos; opinion of <a href="convince.html">you</a> is the foundation
of their opinion of your company.  Founders are often surprised how
quickly investors seem to know when they start to succeed at raising
money.  And while there are in fact lots of ways for such information
to spread among investors, the main vector is probably the founders
themselves.  Though they&apos;re often clueless about technology, most
investors are pretty good at reading people.  When fundraising is
going well, investors are quick to sense it in your increased
confidence.  (This is one case where the average founder&apos;s inability
to remain poker-faced works to your advantage.)<br><br>But frankly the most important reason investors like you more when
you&apos;ve started to raise money is that they&apos;re bad at judging startups.
Judging startups is hard even for the best investors.  The mediocre
ones might as well be flipping coins.  So when mediocre investors
see that lots of other people want to invest in you, they assume
there must be a reason.  This leads to the phenomenon known in the
Valley as the &quot;hot deal,&quot; where you have more interest from investors
than you can handle.<br><br>The best investors aren&apos;t influenced much by the opinion of other
investors.  It would only dilute their own judgment to average it
together with other people&apos;s.  But they are indirectly influenced
in the practical sense that interest from other investors imposes
a deadline.  This is the fourth way in which offers beget offers.
If you start to get far along the track toward an offer with one
firm, it will sometimes provoke other firms, even good ones, to
make up their minds, lest they lose the deal.<br><br>Unless you&apos;re a wizard at negotiation (and if you&apos;re not sure,
you&apos;re not) be very careful about exaggerating this to push a good
investor to decide.  Founders try this sort of thing all the time,
and investors are very sensitive to it.  If anything oversensitive.
But you&apos;re safe so long as you&apos;re telling the truth.  If you&apos;re
getting far along with investor B, but you&apos;d rather raise money
from investor A, you can tell investor A that this is happening.
There&apos;s no manipulation in that.  You&apos;re genuinely in a bind, because
you really would rather raise money from A, but you can&apos;t safely
reject an offer from B when it&apos;s still uncertain what A will decide.<br><br>Do not, however, tell A who B is.  VCs will sometimes ask which
other VCs you&apos;re talking to, but you should never tell them.  Angels
you can sometimes tell about other angels, because angels cooperate
more with one another. But if VCs ask, just point out that they
wouldn&apos;t want you telling other firms about your conversations, and
you feel obliged to do the same for any firm you talk to.  If they
push you, point out that you&apos;re inexperienced at fundraising&#x2014;which
is always a safe card to play&#x2014;and you feel you have to be
extra cautious. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>While few startups will experience a stampede of interest, almost
all will at least initially experience the other side of this
phenomenon, where the herd remains clumped together at a distance.
The fact that investors are so much influenced by other investors&apos;
opinions means you always start out in something of a hole.  So
don&apos;t be demoralized by how hard it is to get the first commitment,
because much of the difficulty comes from this external force.  The
second will be easier.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
An accountant might say that a company that has raised a million
dollars is no richer if it&apos;s convertible debt, but in practice money
raised as convertible debt is little different from money raised
in an equity round.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Founders are often surprised by this, but investors can get
very emotional.  Or rather indignant; that&apos;s the main emotion I&apos;ve
observed; but it is very common, to the point where it sometimes
causes investors to act against their own interests.  I know of one
investor who invested in a startup at a $15 million valuation cap.
Earlier he&apos;d had an opportunity to invest at a $5 million cap, but
he refused because a friend who invested earlier had been able to
invest at a $3 million cap.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
If an investor pushes you hard to tell them about your conversations
with other investors, is this someone you want as an investor?<br><br>

<p>
September 2013<br><br>Most startups that raise money do it more than once.  A typical
trajectory might be (1) to get started with a few tens of thousands
from something like Y Combinator or individual angels, then 
(2) raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company,
and then (3) once the company is clearly succeeding, raise one or
more later rounds to accelerate growth.<br><br>Reality can be messier.  Some companies raise money twice in phase
2.  Others skip phase 1 and go straight to phase 2.  And at Y&#xA0;Combinator 
we get an increasing number of companies that have already
raised amounts in the hundreds of thousands.  But the three phase
path is at least the one about which individual startups&apos; paths
oscillate.<br><br>This essay focuses on phase 2 fundraising.  That&apos;s the type the
startups we fund are doing on Demo Day, and this essay is the advice
we give them.<br><br>
<b>Forces</b><br><br>Fundraising is hard in both senses: hard like lifting a heavy weight,
and hard like solving a puzzle.  It&apos;s hard like lifting a weight
because it&apos;s intrinsically hard to convince people to part with
large sums of money.  That problem is irreducible; it should be
hard.  But much of the other kind of difficulty can be eliminated.
Fundraising only seems a puzzle because it&apos;s an alien world to most
founders, and I hope to fix that by supplying a map through it.<br><br>To founders, the behavior of investors is often opaque&#x2014;partly
because their motivations are obscure, but partly because they
deliberately mislead you.  And the misleading ways of investors
combine horribly with the wishful thinking of inexperienced founders.
At YC we&apos;re always warning founders about this danger, and investors
are probably more circumspect with YC startups than with other
companies they talk to, and even so we witness a constant series
of explosions as these two volatile components combine.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you&apos;re an inexperienced founder, the only way to survive is by
imposing external constraints on yourself.  You can&apos;t trust your
intuitions.  I&apos;m going to give you a set of rules here that will
get you through this process if anything will.  At certain moments
you&apos;ll be tempted to ignore them.  So rule number zero is: these
rules exist for a reason.  You wouldn&apos;t need a rule to keep you
going in one direction if there weren&apos;t powerful forces pushing you
in another.<br><br>The ultimate source of the forces acting on you are the forces
acting on investors.  Investors are pinched between two kinds of
fear: fear of investing in startups that fizzle, and fear of missing
out on startups that take off.  The cause of all this fear is the
very thing that makes startups such attractive investments: the
successful ones grow very fast.  But that fast growth means investors
can&apos;t wait around.  If you wait till a startup is obviously a
success, it&apos;s too late.  To get the really high returns, you have
to invest in startups when it&apos;s still unclear how they&apos;ll do.  But
that in turn makes investors nervous they&apos;re about to invest in a
flop.  As indeed they often are.<br><br>What investors would like to do, if they could, is wait.  When a
startup is only a few months old, every week that passes gives you
significantly more information about them.  But if you wait too
long, other investors might take the deal away from you.  And of
course the other investors are all subject to the same forces.  So
what tends to happen is that they all wait as long as they can,
then when some act the rest have to.<br><br>
<b>Don&apos;t raise money unless you want it and it wants you.</b><br><br>Such a high proportion of successful startups raise money that it
might seem fundraising is one of the defining qualities of a startup.
Actually it isn&apos;t.  <a href="growth.html">Rapid growth</a> is what
makes a company a startup.  Most companies in a position to grow
rapidly find that (a) taking outside money helps them grow faster,
and (b) their growth potential makes it easy to attract such money.
It&apos;s so common for both (a) and (b) to be true of a successful
startup that practically all do raise outside money.  But there may
be cases where a startup either wouldn&apos;t want to grow faster, or
outside money wouldn&apos;t help them to, and if you&apos;re one of them,
don&apos;t raise money.<br><br>The other time not to raise money is when you won&apos;t be able to.  If
you try to raise money before you can <a href="convince.html">convince</a>
investors, you&apos;ll not only waste your time, but also burn your
reputation with those investors.<br><br>
<b>Be in fundraising mode or not.</b><br><br>One of the things that surprises founders most about fundraising
is how distracting it is.  When you start fundraising, everything
else grinds to a halt.  The problem is not the time fundraising
consumes but that it becomes the <a href="top.html">top idea in
your mind</a>.  A startup can&apos;t endure that level of distraction
for long.  An early stage startup grows mostly because the founders
<a href="ds.html">make</a> it grow, and if the founders look away,
growth usually drops sharply.<br><br>Because fundraising is so distracting, a startup should either be
in fundraising mode or not.  And when you do decide to raise money,
you should focus your whole attention on it so you can get it done
quickly and get back to work.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>You can take money from investors when you&apos;re not in fundraising
mode.  You just can&apos;t expend any attention on it.  There are two
things that take attention: convincing investors, and negotiating
with them.  So when you&apos;re not in fundraising mode, you should take
money from investors only if they require no convincing, and are
willing to invest on terms you&apos;ll take without negotiation.  For
example, if a reputable investor is willing to invest on a convertible
note, using standard paperwork, that is either uncapped or capped
at a good valuation, you can take that without having to think.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
The terms will be whatever they turn out to be in your next
equity round.  And &quot;no convincing&quot; means just that: zero time spent
meeting with investors or preparing materials for them.  If an
investor says they&apos;re ready to invest, but they need you to come
in for one meeting to meet some of the partners, tell them no, if
you&apos;re not in fundraising mode, because that&apos;s fundraising. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
Tell them politely; tell them you&apos;re focusing on the company right
now, and that you&apos;ll get back to them when you&apos;re fundraising; but
do not get sucked down the slippery slope.<br><br>Investors will try to lure you into fundraising when you&apos;re not.
It&apos;s great for them if they can, because they can thereby get a
shot at you before everyone else.  They&apos;ll send you emails saying
they want to meet to learn more about you.  If you get cold-emailed
by an associate at a VC firm, you shouldn&apos;t meet even if you are
in fundraising mode.  Deals don&apos;t happen that way.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
But even
if you get an email from a partner you should try to delay meeting
till you&apos;re in fundraising mode.  They may say they just want to
meet and chat, but investors never just want to meet and chat.  What
if they like you?  What if they start to talk about giving you
money?  Will you be able to resist having that conversation?  Unless
you&apos;re experienced enough at fundraising to have a casual conversation
with investors that stays casual, it&apos;s safer to tell them that you&apos;d
be happy to later, when you&apos;re fundraising, but that right now you
need to focus on the company.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Companies that are successful at raising money in phase 2 sometimes
tack on a few investors after leaving fundraising mode.  This is
fine; if fundraising went well, you&apos;ll be able to do it without
spending time convincing them or negotiating about terms.<br><br>
<b>Get introductions to investors.</b><br><br>Before you can talk to investors, you have to be introduced to them.
If you&apos;re presenting at a Demo Day, you&apos;ll be introduced to a whole
bunch simultaneously.  But even if you are, you should supplement
these with intros you collect yourself.<br><br>Do you have to be introduced?  In phase 2, yes.  Some investors
will let you email them a business plan, but you can tell from the
way their sites are organized that they don&apos;t really want startups
to approach them directly.<br><br>Intros vary greatly in effectiveness.  The best type of intro is
from a well-known investor who has just invested in you.  So when
you get an investor to commit, ask them to introduce you to other
investors they respect.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
The next best type of intro is from a
founder of a company they&apos;ve funded.  You can also get intros from
other people in the startup community, like lawyers and reporters.<br><br>There are now sites like AngelList, FundersClub, and WeFunder that
can introduce you to investors.  We recommend startups treat them
as auxiliary sources of money.  Raise money first from leads you
get yourself.  Those will on average be better investors.  Plus
you&apos;ll have an easier time raising money on these sites once you
can say you&apos;ve already raised some from well-known investors.<br><br>
<b>Hear no till you hear yes.</b><br><br>Treat investors as saying no till they unequivocally say yes, in
the form of a definite offer with no contingencies.<br><br>I mentioned earlier that investors prefer to wait if they can.
What&apos;s particularly dangerous for founders is the way they wait.
Essentially, they lead you on.  They seem like they&apos;re about to
invest right up till the moment they say no.  If they even say no.
Some of the worse ones never actually do say no; they just stop
replying to your emails.  They hope that way to get a free option
on investing.  If they decide later that they want to invest&#x2014;usually
because they&apos;ve heard you&apos;re a hot deal&#x2014;they can pretend they
just got distracted and then restart the conversation as if they&apos;d
been about to.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>That&apos;s not the worst thing investors will do.  Some will use language
that makes it sound as if they&apos;re committing, but which doesn&apos;t
actually commit them.  And wishful thinking founders are happy to
meet them half way.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>Fortunately, the next rule is a tactic for neutralizing this behavior.
But to work it depends on you not being tricked by the no that
sounds like yes.  It&apos;s so common for founders to be misled/mistaken
about this that we designed a <a href="http://ycombinator.com/hdp.html">protocol</a> to fix the
problem.  If you believe an investor has committed, get them to
confirm it.  If you and they have different views of reality, whether
the source of the discrepancy is their sketchiness or your wishful
thinking, the prospect of confirming a commitment in writing will
flush it out.  And till they confirm, regard them as saying no.<br><br>
<b>Do breadth-first search weighted by expected value.</b><br><br>When you talk to investors your m.o. should be breadth-first search,
weighted by expected value.  You should always talk to investors
in parallel rather than serially.  You can&apos;t afford the time it
takes to talk to investors serially, plus if you only talk to one
investor at a time, they don&apos;t have the pressure of other investors
to make them act.  But you shouldn&apos;t pay the same attention to every
investor, because some are more promising prospects than others.
The optimal solution is to talk to all potential investors in
parallel, but give higher priority to the more promising ones. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>Expected value = how likely an investor is to say yes, multiplied
by how good it would be if they did.  So for example, an eminent
investor who would invest a lot, but will be hard to convince, might
have the same expected value as an obscure angel who won&apos;t invest
much, but will be easy to convince.  Whereas an obscure angel who
will only invest a small amount, and yet needs to meet multiple
times before making up his mind, has very low expected value.  Meet
such investors last, if at all. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>Doing breadth-first search weighted by expected value will save you
from investors who never explicitly say no but merely drift away,
because you&apos;ll drift away from them at the same rate.  It protects
you from investors who flake in much the same way that a distributed
algorithm protects you from processors that fail.  If some investor
isn&apos;t returning your emails, or wants to have lots of meetings but
isn&apos;t progressing toward making you an offer, you automatically
focus less on them.  But you have to be disciplined about assigning
probabilities.  You can&apos;t let how much you want an investor influence
your estimate of how much they want you.<br><br>
<b>Know where you stand.</b><br><br>How do you judge how well you&apos;re doing with an investor, when
investors habitually seem more positive than they are?  By looking
at their actions rather than their words.  Every investor has some
track they need to move along from the first conversation to wiring
the money, and you should always know what that track consists of,
where you are on it, and how fast you&apos;re moving forward.<br><br>Never leave a meeting with an investor without asking what happens
next.  What more do they need in order to decide?  Do they need
another meeting with you?  To talk about what?  And how soon?  Do
they need to do something internally, like talk to their partners,
or investigate some issue?  How long do they expect it to take?
Don&apos;t be too pushy, but know where you stand.  If investors are
vague or resist answering such questions, assume the worst; investors
who are seriously interested in you will usually be happy to talk
about what has to happen between now and wiring the money, because
they&apos;re already running through that in their heads. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you&apos;re experienced at negotiations, you already know how to ask
such questions.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font>
If you&apos;re not, there&apos;s a trick you can use
in this situation.  Investors know you&apos;re inexperienced at raising
money.  Inexperience there doesn&apos;t make you unattractive.  Being a
noob at technology would, if you&apos;re starting a technology startup,
but not being a noob at fundraising.  Larry and Sergey were noobs
at fundraising.  So you can just confess that you&apos;re inexperienced
at this and ask how their process works and where you are in it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#999999">14</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Get the first commitment.</b><br><br>The biggest factor in most investors&apos; opinions of you is the opinion
of <a href="herd.html">other investors</a>.  Once you start getting
investors to commit, it becomes increasingly easy to get more to.
But the other side of this coin is that it&apos;s often hard to get the
first commitment.<br><br>Getting the first substantial offer can be half the total difficulty
of fundraising.  What counts as a substantial offer depends on who
it&apos;s from and how much it is.  Money from friends and family doesn&apos;t
usually count, no matter how much.  But if you get $50k from a well
known VC firm or angel investor, that will usually be enough to set
things rolling.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#999999">15</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Close committed money.</b><br><br>It&apos;s not a deal till the money&apos;s in the bank.  I often hear
inexperienced founders say things like &quot;We&apos;ve raised $800,000,&quot;
only to discover that zero of it is in the bank so far.  Remember
the twin fears that torment investors?  The fear of missing out
that makes them jump early, and the fear of jumping onto a turd
that results?  This is a market where people are exceptionally prone
to buyer&apos;s remorse.  And it&apos;s also one that furnishes them plenty
of excuses to gratify it.  The public markets snap startup investing
around like a whip.  If the Chinese economy blows up tomorrow, all
bets are off.  But there are lots of surprises for individual
startups too, and they tend to be concentrated around fundraising.
Tomorrow a big competitor could appear, or you could get C&amp;Ded, or
your cofounder could quit.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#999999">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>Even a day&apos;s delay can bring news that causes an investor to change
their mind.  So when someone commits, get the money.  Knowing where
you stand doesn&apos;t end when they say they&apos;ll invest.  After they say
yes, know what the timetable is for getting the money, and then
babysit that process till it happens.  Institutional investors have
people in charge of wiring money, but you may have to hunt angels
down in person to collect a check.<br><br>Inexperienced investors are the ones most likely to get buyer&apos;s
remorse.  Established ones have learned to treat saying yes as like
diving off a diving board, and they also have more brand to preserve.
But I&apos;ve heard of cases of even top-tier VC firms welching on deals.<br><br>
<b>Avoid investors who don&apos;t &quot;lead.&quot;</b><br><br>Since getting the first offer is most of the difficulty of fundraising,
that should be part of your calculation of expected value when you
start.  You have to estimate not just the probability that an
investor will say yes, but the probability that they&apos;d be the <i>first</i>
to say yes, and the latter is not simply a constant fraction of the
former.  Some investors are known for deciding quickly, and those
are extra valuable early on.<br><br>Conversely, an investor who will only invest once other investors
have is worthless initially.  And while most investors are influenced
by how interested other investors are in you, there are some who
have an explicit policy of only investing after other investors
have.  You can recognize this contemptible subspecies of investor
because they often talk about &quot;leads.&quot;  They say that they don&apos;t
lead, or that they&apos;ll invest once you have a lead.  Sometimes they
even claim to be willing to lead themselves, by which they mean
they won&apos;t invest till you get $x from other investors.  (It&apos;s great
if by &quot;lead&quot; they mean they&apos;ll invest unilaterally, and in addition
will help you raise more.  What&apos;s lame is when they use the term
to mean they won&apos;t invest unless you can raise more elsewhere.)
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f17n"><font color="#999999">17</font></a>]</font><br><br>Where does this term &quot;lead&quot; come from?  Up till a few years ago,
startups raising money in phase 2 would usually raise equity rounds
in which several investors invested at the same time using the same
paperwork.  You&apos;d negotiate the terms with one &quot;lead&quot; investor, and
then all the others would sign the same documents and all the money
change hands at the closing.<br><br>Series A rounds still work that way, but things now work differently
for most fundraising prior to the series A.  Now there are rarely
actual rounds before the A round, or leads for them.  Now startups
simply raise money from investors one at a time till they feel they
have enough.<br><br>Since there are no longer leads, why do investors use that term?
Because it&apos;s a more legitimate-sounding way of saying what they
really mean.  All they really mean is that their interest in you
is a function of other investors&apos; interest in you.  I.e. the spectral
signature of all mediocre investors.  But when phrased in terms of
leads, it sounds like there is something structural and therefore
legitimate about their behavior.<br><br>When an investor tells you &quot;I want to invest in you, but I don&apos;t
lead,&quot; translate that in your mind to &quot;No, except yes if you turn
out to be a hot deal.&quot;  And since that&apos;s the default opinion of any
investor about any startup, they&apos;ve essentially just told you
nothing.<br><br>When you first start fundraising, the expected value of an investor
who won&apos;t &quot;lead&quot; is zero, so talk to such investors last if at all.<br><br>
<b>Have multiple plans.</b><br><br>Many investors will ask how much you&apos;re planning to raise. This
question makes founders feel they should be planning to raise a
specific amount.  But in fact you shouldn&apos;t.  It&apos;s a mistake to
have fixed plans in an undertaking as unpredictable as fundraising.<br><br>So why do investors ask how much you plan to raise?  For much the
same reasons a salesperson in a store will ask &quot;How much were you
planning to spend?&quot; if you walk in looking for a gift for a friend.
You probably didn&apos;t have a precise amount in mind; you just want
to find something good, and if it&apos;s inexpensive, so much the better.
The salesperson asks you this not because you&apos;re supposed to have
a plan to spend a specific amount, but so they can show you only
things that cost the most you&apos;ll pay.<br><br>Similarly, when investors ask how much you plan to raise, it&apos;s not
because you&apos;re supposed to have a plan.  It&apos;s to see whether you&apos;d
be a suitable recipient for the size of investment they like to
make, and also to judge your ambition, reasonableness, and how far
you are along with fundraising.<br><br>If you&apos;re a wizard at fundraising, you can say &quot;We plan to raise
a $7 million series A round, and we&apos;ll be accepting termsheets next
tuesday.&quot;  I&apos;ve known a handful of founders who could pull that off
without having VCs laugh in their faces.  But if you&apos;re in the
inexperienced but earnest majority, the solution is analogous to
the solution I recommend for <a href="convince.html">pitching</a>
your startup: do the right thing and then just tell investors what
you&apos;re doing.<br><br>And the right strategy, in fundraising, is to have multiple plans
depending on how much you can raise.  Ideally you should be able
to tell investors something like: we can make it to profitability
without raising any more money, but if we raise a few hundred
thousand we can hire one or two smart friends, and if we raise a
couple million, we can hire a whole engineering team, etc.<br><br>Different plans match different investors.  If you&apos;re talking to a
VC firm that only does series A rounds (though there are few of
those left), it would be a waste of time talking about any but your
most expensive plan.  Whereas if you&apos;re talking to an angel who
invests $20k at a time and you haven&apos;t raised any money yet, you
probably want to focus on your least expensive plan.<br><br>If you&apos;re so fortunate as to have to think about the upper limit
on what you should raise, a good rule of thumb is to multiply the
number of people you want to hire times $15k times 18 months.  In
most startups, nearly all the costs are a function of the number
of people, and $15k per month is the conventional total cost
(including benefits and even office space) per person.  $15k per
month is high, so don&apos;t actually spend that much.  But it&apos;s ok to
use a high estimate when fundraising to add a margin for error.  If
you have additional expenses, like manufacturing, add in those at
the end.  Assuming you have none and you think you might hire 20
people, the most you&apos;d want to raise is 20 x $15k x 18 = $5.4
million.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f18n"><font color="#999999">18</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Underestimate how much you want.</b><br><br>Though you can focus on different plans when talking to different
types of investors, you should on the whole err on the side of
underestimating the amount you hope to raise.<br><br>For example, if you&apos;d like to raise $500k, it&apos;s better to say
initially that you&apos;re trying to raise $250k.  Then when you reach
$150k you&apos;re more than half done.  That sends two useful signals
to investors: that you&apos;re doing well, and that they have to decide
quickly because you&apos;re running out of room.  Whereas if you&apos;d said
you were raising $500k, you&apos;d be less than a third done at $150k.
If fundraising stalled there for an appreciable time, you&apos;d start
to read as a failure.<br><br>Saying initially that you&apos;re raising $250k doesn&apos;t limit you to
raising that much.  When you reach your initial target and you still
have investor interest, you can just decide to raise more.  Startups
do that all the time.  In fact, most startups that are very successful
at fundraising end up raising more than they originally intended.<br><br>I&apos;m not saying you should lie, but that you should lower your
expectations initially.  There is almost no downside in starting
with a low number.  It not only won&apos;t cap the amount you raise, but
will on the whole tend to increase it.<br><br>A good metaphor here is angle of attack.  If you try to fly at too
steep an angle of attack, you just stall.  If you say right out of
the gate that you want to raise a $5 million series A round, unless
you&apos;re in a very strong position, you not only won&apos;t get that but
won&apos;t get anything. Better to start at a low angle of attack, build
up speed, and then gradually increase the angle if you want.<br><br>
<b>Be profitable if you can.</b><br><br>You will be in a much stronger position if your collection of plans
includes one for raising zero dollars&#x2014;i.e. if you can make
it to profitability without raising any additional money.  Ideally
you want to be able to say to investors &quot;We&apos;ll succeed no matter
what, but raising money will help us do it faster.&quot;<br><br>There are many analogies between fundraising and dating, and this
is one of the strongest.  No one wants you if you seem desperate.
And the best way not to seem desperate is not to <i>be</i> desperate.
That&apos;s one reason we urge startups during YC to keep expenses low
and to try to make it to <a href="ramenprofitable.html">ramen
profitability</a> before Demo Day.  Though it sounds slightly
paradoxical, if you want to raise money, the best thing you can do
is get yourself to the point where you don&apos;t need to.<br><br>There are almost two distinct modes of fundraising: one in which
founders who need money knock on doors seeking it, knowing that
otherwise the company will die or at the very least people will
have to be fired, and one in which founders who don&apos;t need money
take some to grow faster than they could merely on their own revenues.
To emphasize the distinction I&apos;m going to name them: type A fundraising
is when you don&apos;t need money, and type B fundraising is when you
do.<br><br>Inexperienced founders read about famous startups doing what was
type A fundraising, and decide they should raise money too, since
that seems to be how startups work. Except when they raise money
they don&apos;t have a clear path to profitability and are thus doing
type B fundraising.  And they are then surprised how difficult and
unpleasant it is.<br><br>Of course not all startups can make it to ramen profitability in a
few months.  And some that don&apos;t still manage to have the upper
hand over investors, if they have some other advantage like
extraordinary growth numbers or exceptionally formidable founders.
But as time passes it gets increasingly difficult to fundraise from
a position of strength without being profitable.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f19n"><font color="#999999">19</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Don&apos;t optimize for valuation.</b><br><br>When you raise money, what should your valuation be?  The most
important thing to understand about valuation is that it&apos;s not that
important.<br><br>Founders who raise money at high valuations tend to be unduly proud
of it.  Founders are often competitive people, and since valuation
is usually the only visible number attached to a startup, they end
up competing to raise money at the highest valuation.  This is
stupid, because fundraising is not the test that matters.  The real
test is revenue.  Fundraising is just a means to that end.  Being
proud of how well you did at fundraising is like being proud of
your college grades.<br><br>Not only is fundraising not the test that matters, valuation is not
even the thing to optimize about fundraising.  The number one thing
you want from phase 2 fundraising is to get the money you need, so
you can get back to focusing on the real test, the success of your
company.  Number two is good investors. Valuation is at best third.<br><br>The empirical evidence shows just how unimportant it is.  Dropbox
and Airbnb are the most successful companies we&apos;ve funded so far,
and they raised money after Y Combinator at premoney valuations of
$4 million and $2.6 million respectively. Prices are so much higher
now that if you can raise money at all you&apos;ll probably raise it at
higher valuations than Dropbox and Airbnb.  So let that satisfy
your competitiveness.  You&apos;re doing better than Dropbox and Airbnb!
At a test that doesn&apos;t matter.<br><br>When you start fundraising, your initial valuation (or valuation
cap) will be set by the deal you make with the first investor who
commits.  You can increase the price for later investors, if you
get a lot of interest, but by default the valuation you got from
the first investor becomes your asking price.<br><br>So if you&apos;re raising money from multiple investors, as most companies
do in phase 2, you have to be careful to avoid raising the first
from an over-eager investor at a price you won&apos;t be able to
sustain.  You can of course lower your price if you need to (in
which case you should give the same terms to investors who invested
earlier at a higher price), but you may lose a bunch of leads in
the process of realizing you need to do this.<br><br>What you can do if you have eager first investors is raise money
from them on an uncapped convertible note with an MFN clause.  This
is essentially a way of saying that the valuation cap of the note
will be determined by the next investors you raise money from.<br><br>It will be easier to raise money at a lower valuation.  It shouldn&apos;t
be, but it is.  Since phase 2 prices vary at most 10x and the big
successes generate returns of at least 100x, investors should pick
startups entirely based on their estimate of the probability that
the company will be a big success and hardly at all on price.  But
although it&apos;s a mistake for investors to care about price, a
significant number do.  A startup that investors seem to like but
won&apos;t invest in at a cap of $x will have an easier time at $x/2.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f20n"><font color="#999999">20</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Yes/no before valuation.</b><br><br>Some investors want to know what your valuation is before they even
talk to you about investing.  If your valuation has already been
set by a prior investment at a specific valuation or cap, you can
tell them that number.  But if it isn&apos;t set because you haven&apos;t
closed anyone yet, and they try to push you to name a price, resist
doing so.  If this would be the first investor you&apos;ve closed, then
this could be the tipping point of fundraising. That means closing
this investor is the first priority, and you need to get the
conversation onto that instead of being dragged sideways into a
discussion of price.<br><br>Fortunately there is a way to avoid naming a price in this situation.
And it is not just a negotiating trick; it&apos;s how you (both) should
be operating.  Tell them that valuation is not the most important
thing to you and that you haven&apos;t thought much about it, that you
are looking for investors you want to partner with and who want to
partner with you, and that you should talk first about whether they
want to invest at all.  Then if they decide they do want to invest,
you can figure out a price. But first things first.<br><br>Since valuation isn&apos;t that important and getting fundraising rolling
is, we usually tell founders to give the first investor who commits
as low a price as they need to.  This is a safe technique so long
as you combine it with the next one. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f21n"><font color="#999999">21</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Beware &quot;valuation sensitive&quot; investors.</b><br><br>Occasionally you&apos;ll encounter investors who describe themselves as
&quot;valuation sensitive.&quot;  What this means in practice is that they
are compulsive negotiators who will suck up a lot of your time
trying to push your price down.  You should therefore never approach
such investors first. While you shouldn&apos;t chase high valuations,
you also don&apos;t want your valuation to be set artificially low because
the first investor who committed happened to be a compulsive
negotiator.  Some such investors have value, but the time to approach
them is near the end of fundraising, when you&apos;re in a position to
say &quot;this is the price everyone else has paid; take it or leave it&quot;
and not mind if they leave it.  This way, you&apos;ll not only get market
price, but it will also take less time.<br><br>Ideally you know which investors have a reputation for being
&quot;valuation sensitive&quot; and can postpone dealing with them till last,
but occasionally one you didn&apos;t know about will pop up early on.
The rule of doing breadth first search weighted by expected value
already tells you what to do in this case: slow down your interactions
with them.<br><br>There are a handful of investors who will try to invest at a lower
valuation even when your price has already been set.  Lowering your
price is a backup plan you resort to when you discover you&apos;ve let
the price get set too high to close all the money you need.  So
you&apos;d only want to talk to this sort of investor if you were about
to do that anyway.  But since investor meetings have to be arranged
at least a few days in advance and you can&apos;t predict when you&apos;ll
need to resort to lowering your price, this means in practice that
you should approach this type of investor last if at all.<br><br>If you&apos;re surprised by a lowball offer, treat it as a backup offer
and delay responding to it.  When someone makes an offer in good
faith, you have a moral obligation to respond in a reasonable time.
But lowballing you is a dick move that should be met with the
corresponding countermove.<br><br>
<b>Accept offers greedily.</b><br><br>I&apos;m a little leery of using the term &quot;greedily&quot; when writing about
fundraising lest non-programmers misunderstand me, but a greedy
algorithm is simply one that doesn&apos;t try to look into the future.
A greedy algorithm takes the best of the options in front of it
right now.  And that is how startups should approach fundraising
in phases 2 and later.  Don&apos;t try to look into the future because
(a) the future is unpredictable, and indeed in this business you&apos;re
often being deliberately misled about it and (b) your first priority
in fundraising should be to get it finished and get back to work
anyway.<br><br>If someone makes you an acceptable offer, take it.  If you have
multiple incompatible offers, take the best.  Don&apos;t reject an
acceptable offer in the hope of getting a better one in the future.<br><br>These simple rules cover a wide variety of cases.  If you&apos;re raising
money from many investors, roll them up as they say yes.  As you
start to feel you&apos;ve raised enough, the threshold for acceptable
will start to get higher.<br><br>In practice offers exist for stretches of time, not points.  So
when you get an acceptable offer that would be incompatible with
others (e.g. an offer to invest most of the money you need), you
can tell the other investors you&apos;re talking to that you have an
offer good enough to accept, and give them a few days to make their
own.  This could lose you some that might have made an offer if
they had more time.  But by definition you don&apos;t care; the initial
offer was acceptable.<br><br>Some investors will try to prevent others from having time to decide
by giving you an &quot;exploding&quot; offer, meaning one that&apos;s only valid
for a few days.  Offers from the very best investors explode less
frequently and less rapidly&#x2014;Fred Wilson never gives exploding
offers, for example&#x2014;because they&apos;re confident you&apos;ll pick
them.  But lower-tier investors sometimes give offers with very
short fuses, because they believe no one who had other options would
choose them.  A deadline of three working days is acceptable.  You
shouldn&apos;t need more than that if you&apos;ve been talking to investors
in parallel.  But a deadline any shorter is a sign you&apos;re dealing
with a sketchy investor.  You can usually call their bluff, and you
may need to.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f22n"><font color="#999999">22</font></a>]</font><br><br>It might seem that instead of accepting offers greedily, your goal
should be to get the best investors as partners.  That is certainly
a good goal, but in phase 2 &quot;get the best investors&quot; only rarely
conflicts with &quot;accept offers greedily,&quot; because the best investors
don&apos;t usually take any longer to decide than the others.  The only
case where the two strategies give conflicting advice is when you
have to forgo an offer from an acceptable investor to see if you&apos;ll
get an offer from a better one.  If you talk to investors in parallel
and push back on exploding offers with excessively short deadlines,
that will almost never happen.  But if it does, &quot;get the best
investors&quot; is in the average case bad advice.  The best investors
are also the most selective, because they get their pick of all the
startups.  They reject nearly everyone they talk to, which means
in the average case it&apos;s a bad trade to exchange a definite offer
from an acceptable investor for a potential offer from a better
one.<br><br>(The situation is different in phase 1.  You can&apos;t apply to all the
incubators in parallel, because some offset their schedules to
prevent this.  In phase 1, &quot;accept offers greedily&quot; and &quot;get the
best investors&quot; do conflict, so if you want to apply to multiple
incubators, you should do it in such a way that the ones you want
most decide first.)<br><br>Sometimes when you&apos;re raising money from multiple investors, a
series A will emerge out of those conversations, and these rules
even cover what to do in that case.  When an investor starts to
talk to you about a series A, keep taking smaller investments till
they actually give you a termsheet.  There&apos;s no practical difficulty.
If the smaller investments are on convertible notes, they&apos;ll just
convert into the series A round.  The series A investor won&apos;t like
having all these other random investors as bedfellows, but if it
bothers them so much they should get on with giving you a termsheet.
Till they do, you don&apos;t know for sure they will, and the greedy
algorithm tells you what to do.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f23n"><font color="#999999">23</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Don&apos;t sell more than 25% in phase 2.</b><br><br>If you do well, you will probably raise a series A round eventually.
I say probably because things are changing with series A rounds.
Startups may start to skip them.  But only one company we&apos;ve funded
has so far, so tentatively assume the path to huge passes through
an A round.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f24n"><font color="#999999">24</font></a>]</font><br><br>Which means you should avoid doing things in earlier rounds that
will mess up raising an A round.  For example, if you&apos;ve sold more
than about 40% of your company total, it starts to get harder to
raise an A round, because VCs worry there will not be enough stock
left to keep the founders motivated.<br><br>Our rule of thumb is not to sell more than 25% in phase 2, on top
of whatever you sold in phase 1, which should be less than 15%.  If
you&apos;re raising money on uncapped notes, you&apos;ll have to guess what
the eventual equity round valuation might be.  Guess conservatively.<br><br>(Since the goal of this rule is to avoid messing up the series A,
there&apos;s obviously an exception if you end up raising a series A in
phase 2, as a handful of startups do.)<br><br>
<b>Have one person handle fundraising.</b><br><br>If you have multiple founders, pick one to handle fundraising so
the other(s) can keep working on the company.  And since the danger
of fundraising is not the time taken up by the actual meetings but
that it becomes the top idea in your mind, the founder who handles
fundraising should make a conscious effort to insulate the other
founder(s) from the details of the process.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f25n"><font color="#999999">25</font></a>]</font><br><br>(If the founders mistrust one another, this could cause some friction.
But if the founders mistrust one another, you have worse problems
to worry about than how to organize fundraising.)<br><br>The founder who handles fundraising should be the CEO, who should
in turn be the most formidable of the founders.  Even if the CEO
is a programmer and another founder is a salesperson?  Yes.  If you
happen to be that type of founding team, you&apos;re effectively a single
founder when it comes to fundraising.<br><br>It&apos;s ok to bring all the founders to meet an investor who will
invest a lot, and who needs this meeting as the final step before
deciding.  But wait till that point.  Introducing an investor to
your cofounder(s) should be like introducing a girl/boyfriend to
your parents&#x2014;something you do only when things reach a certain
stage of seriousness.<br><br>Even if there are still one or more founders focusing on the company
during fundraising, growth will slow.  But try to get as much growth
as you can, because fundraising is a segment of time, not a point,
and what happens to the company during that time affects the outcome.
If your numbers grow significantly between two investor meetings,
investors will be hot to close, and if your numbers are flat or
down they&apos;ll start to get cold feet.<br><br>
<b>You&apos;ll need an executive summary and (maybe) a deck.</b><br><br>Traditionally phase 2 fundraising consists of presenting a slide
deck in person to investors.  Sequoia describes what such a deck
should <a href="http://www.sequoiacap.com/ideas">contain</a>, and
since they&apos;re the customer you can take their word for it.<br><br>I say &quot;traditionally&quot; because I&apos;m ambivalent about decks, and (though
perhaps this is wishful thinking) they seem to be on the way out.
A lot of the most successful startups we fund never make decks in
phase 2.  They just talk to investors and explain what they plan
to do.  Fundraising usually takes off fast for the startups that
are most successful at it, and they&apos;re thus able to excuse themselves
by saying that they haven&apos;t had time to make a deck.<br><br>You&apos;ll also want an executive summary, which should be no more than
a page long and describe in the most matter of fact language what
you plan to do, why it&apos;s a good idea, and what progress you&apos;ve made
so far.  The point of the summary is to remind the investor (who
may have met many startups that day) what you talked about.<br><br>Assume that if you give someone a copy of your deck or executive
summary, it will be passed on to whoever you&apos;d least like to have
it.  But don&apos;t refuse on that account to give copies to investors
you meet.  You just have to treat such leaks as a cost of doing
business.  In practice it&apos;s not that high a cost.  Though founders
are rightly indignant when their plans get leaked to competitors,
I can&apos;t think of a startup whose outcome has been affected by it.<br><br>Sometimes an investor will ask you to send them your deck and/or
executive summary before they decide whether to meet with you.  I
wouldn&apos;t do that.  It&apos;s a sign they&apos;re not really interested.<br><br>
<b>Stop fundraising when it stops working.</b><br><br>When do you stop fundraising?  Ideally when you&apos;ve raised enough.
But what if you haven&apos;t raised as much as you&apos;d like?  When do you
give up?<br><br>It&apos;s hard to give general advice about this, because there have
been cases of startups that kept trying to raise money even when
it seemed hopeless, and miraculously succeeded. But what I usually
tell founders is to stop fundraising when you start to get a lot
of air in the straw.  When you&apos;re drinking through a straw, you can
tell when you get to the end of the liquid because you start to get
a lot of air in the straw.  When your fundraising options run out,
they usually run out in the same way.  Don&apos;t keep sucking on the
straw if you&apos;re just getting air.  It&apos;s not going to get better.<br><br>
<b>Don&apos;t get addicted to fundraising.</b><br><br>Fundraising is a chore for most founders, but some find it more
interesting than working on their startup.  The work at an early
stage startup often consists of unglamorous <a href="schlep.html">schleps</a>.  Whereas fundraising, when it&apos;s
going well, can be quite the opposite.  Instead of sitting in your
grubby apartment listening to users complain about bugs in your
software, you&apos;re being offered millions of dollars by famous investors
over lunch at a nice restaurant.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f26n"><font color="#999999">26</font></a>]</font><br><br>The danger of fundraising is particularly acute for people who are
good at it.  It&apos;s always fun to work on something you&apos;re good at.
If you&apos;re one of these people, beware.  Fundraising is not what
will make your company successful.  Listening to users complain
about bugs in your software is what will make you successful.  And
the big danger of getting addicted to fundraising is not merely
that you&apos;ll spend too long on it or raise too much money.  It&apos;s
that you&apos;ll start to think of yourself as being already successful,
and lose your taste for the schleps you need to undertake to actually
be successful.  Startups can be destroyed by this.<br><br>When I see a startup with young founders that is fabulously successful
at fundraising, I mentally decrease my estimate of the probability
that they&apos;ll succeed.  The press may be writing about them as if
they&apos;d been anointed as the next Google, but I&apos;m thinking &quot;this is
going to end badly.&quot;<br><br>
<b>Don&apos;t raise too much.</b><br><br>Though only a handful of startups have to worry about this, it is
possible to raise too much.  The dangers of raising too much are
subtle but insidious.  One is that it will set impossibly high
expectations.  If you raise an excessive amount of money, it will
be at a high valuation, and the danger of raising money at too high
a valuation is that you won&apos;t be able to increase it sufficiently
the next time you raise money.<br><br>A company&apos;s valuation is expected to rise each time it raises money.
If not it&apos;s a sign of a company in trouble, which makes you
unattractive to investors.  So if you raise money in phase 2 at a
post-money valuation of $30 million, the pre-money valuation of
your next round, if you want to raise one, is going to have to be
at least $50 million.  And you have to be doing really, really well
to raise money at $50 million.<br><br>It&apos;s very dangerous to let the competitiveness of your current round
set the performance threshold you have to meet to raise your next
one, because the two are only loosely coupled.<br><br>But the money itself may be more dangerous than the valuation.  The
more you raise, the more you spend, and spending a lot of money can
be disastrous for an early stage startup.  Spending a lot makes it
harder to become profitable, and perhaps even worse, it makes you
more rigid, because the main way to spend money is people, and the
more people you have, the harder it is to change directions.  So
if you do raise a huge amount of money, don&apos;t spend it.  (You will
find that advice almost impossible to follow, so hot will be the
money burning a hole in your pocket, but I feel obliged at least
to try.)<br><br>
<b>Be nice.</b><br><br>Startups raising money occasionally alienate investors by seeming
arrogant.  Sometimes because they are arrogant, and sometimes because
they&apos;re noobs clumsily attempting to mimic the toughness they&apos;ve
observed in experienced founders.<br><br>It&apos;s a mistake to behave arrogantly to investors.  While there are
certain situations in which certain investors like certain kinds
of arrogance, investors vary greatly in this respect, and a flick
of the whip that will bring one to heel will make another roar with
indignation.  The only safe strategy is never to seem arrogant at
all.<br><br>That will require some diplomacy if you follow the advice I&apos;ve given
here, because the advice I&apos;ve given is essentially how to play
hardball back.  When you refuse to meet an investor because you&apos;re
not in fundraising mode, or slow down your interactions with an
investor who moves too slow, or treat a contingent offer as the no
it actually is and then, by accepting offers greedily, end up leaving
that investor out, you&apos;re going to be doing things investors don&apos;t
like.  So you must cushion the blow with soft words.  At YC we tell
startups they can blame us.  And now that I&apos;ve written this, everyone
else can blame me if they want.  That plus the inexperience card
should work in most situations: sorry, we think you&apos;re great, but
PG said startups shouldn&apos;t ___, and since we&apos;re new to fundraising,
we feel like we have to play it safe.<br><br>The danger of behaving arrogantly is greatest when you&apos;re doing
well.  When everyone wants you, it&apos;s hard not to let it go to your
head.  Especially if till recently no one wanted you.  But restrain
yourself.  The startup world is a small place, and startups have
lots of ups and downs.  This is a domain where it&apos;s more true than
usual that pride goeth before a fall.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f27n"><font color="#999999">27</font></a>]</font><br><br>Be nice when investors reject you as well.  The best investors are
not wedded to their initial opinion of you.  If they reject you in
phase 2 and you end up doing well, they&apos;ll often invest in phase
3.  In fact investors who reject you are some of your warmest leads
for future fundraising.  Any investor who spent significant time
deciding probably came close to saying yes.  Often you have some
internal champion who only needs a little more evidence to convince
the skeptics.  So it&apos;s wise not merely to be nice to investors who
reject you, but (unless they behaved badly) to treat it as the
beginning of a relationship.<br><br>
<b>The bar will be higher next time.</b><br><br>Assume the money you raise in phase 2 will be the last you ever
raise.  You must make it to profitability on this money if you can.<br><br>Over the past several years, the investment community has evolved
from a strategy of anointing a small number of winners early and
then supporting them for years to a strategy of spraying money at
early stage startups and then ruthlessly culling them at the next
stage.  This is probably the optimal strategy for investors.  It&apos;s
too hard to pick winners early on.  Better to let the market do it
for you.  But it often comes as a surprise to startups how much
harder it is to raise money in phase 3.<br><br>When your company is only a couple months old, all it has to be is
a promising experiment that&apos;s worth funding to see how it turns
out.  The next time you raise money, the experiment has to have
worked.  You have to be on a trajectory that leads to going public.
And while there are some ideas where the proof that the experiment
worked might consist of e.g. query response times, usually the proof
is profitability.  Usually phase 3 fundraising has to be type A
fundraising.<br><br>In practice there are two ways startups hose themselves between
phases 2 and 3.  Some are just too slow to become profitable.  They
raise enough money to last for two years.  There doesn&apos;t seem any
particular urgency to be profitable.  So they don&apos;t make any effort
to make money for a year.  But by that time, not making money has
become habitual.  When they finally decide to try, they find they
can&apos;t.<br><br>The other way companies hose themselves is by letting their expenses
grow too fast.  Which almost always means hiring too many people.
You usually shouldn&apos;t go out and hire 8 people as soon as you raise
money at phase 2.  Usually you want to wait till you have growth
(and thus usually revenues) to justify them.  A lot of VCs will
encourage you to hire aggressively.  VCs generally tell you to spend
too much, partly because as money people they err on the side of
solving problems by spending money, and partly because they want
you to sell them more of your company in subsequent rounds.  Don&apos;t
listen to them.<br><br>
<b>Don&apos;t make things complicated.</b><br><br>I realize it may seem odd to sum up this huge treatise by saying
that my overall advice is not to make fundraising too complicated,
but if you go back and look at this list you&apos;ll see it&apos;s basically
a simple recipe with a lot of implications and edge cases.  Avoid
investors till you decide to raise money, and then when you do,
talk to them all in parallel, prioritized by expected value, and
accept offers greedily.  That&apos;s fundraising in one sentence.  Don&apos;t
introduce complicated optimizations, and don&apos;t let investors introduce
complications either.<br><br>Fundraising is not what will make you successful.  It&apos;s just a means
to an end.  Your primary goal should be to get it over with and get
back to what will make you successful&#x2014;making things and talking
to users&#x2014;and the path I&apos;ve described will for most startups
be the surest way to that destination.<br><br>Be good, take care of yourselves, and <i>don&apos;t leave the path</i>.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
The worst explosions happen when unpromising-seeming startups
encounter mediocre investors.  Good investors don&apos;t lead startups
on; their reputations are too valuable.  And startups that seem
promising can usually get enough money from good investors that
they don&apos;t have to talk to mediocre ones.  It is the unpromising-seeming
startups that have to resort to raising money from mediocre investors.
And it&apos;s particularly damaging when these investors flake, because
unpromising-seeming startups are usually more desperate for money.<br><br>(Not all unpromising-seeming startups do badly.  Some are merely
ugly ducklings in the sense that they violate current startup
fashions.)<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
One YC founder told me:
<blockquote>
  I think in general we&apos;ve done ok at fundraising, but I managed
  to screw up twice at the exact same thing&#x2014;trying to focus
  on building the company and fundraising at the same time.
</blockquote>
[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
There is one subtle danger you have to watch out for here, which
I warn about later: beware of getting too high a valuation from an
eager investor, lest that set an impossibly high target when raising
additional money.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
If they really need a meeting, then they&apos;re not ready to invest,
regardless of what they say. They&apos;re still deciding, which means
you&apos;re being asked to come in and convince them. Which is fundraising.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Associates at VC firms regularly cold email startups.  Naive
founders think &quot;Wow, a VC is interested in us!&quot;  But an associate
is not a VC.  They have no decision-making power.  And while they
may introduce startups they like to partners at their firm, the
partners discriminate against deals that come to them this way.   I
don&apos;t know of a single VC investment that began with an associate
cold-emailing a startup.  If you want to approach a specific firm,
get an intro to a partner from someone they respect.<br><br>It&apos;s ok to talk to an associate if you get an intro to a VC firm
or they see you at a Demo Day and they begin by having an associate
vet you.  That&apos;s not a promising lead and should therefore get low
priority, but it&apos;s not as completely worthless as a cold email.<br><br>Because the title &quot;associate&quot; has gotten a bad reputation, a few
VC firms have started to give their associates the title &quot;partner,&quot;
which can make things very confusing.  If you&apos;re a YC startup you
can ask us who&apos;s who; otherwise you may have to do some research
online.  There may be a special title for actual partners.  If
someone speaks for the firm in the press or a blog on the firm&apos;s
site, they&apos;re probably a real partner.  If they&apos;re on boards of
directors they&apos;re probably a real partner.<br><br>There are titles between &quot;associate&quot; and &quot;partner,&quot; including
&quot;principal&quot; and &quot;venture partner.&quot;  The meanings of these titles
vary too much to generalize.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
For similar reasons, avoid casual conversations with potential
acquirers.  They can lead to distractions even more dangerous than
fundraising.  Don&apos;t even take a meeting with a potential acquirer
unless you want to sell your company right now.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Joshua Reeves specifically suggests asking each investor to
intro you to two more investors.<br><br>Don&apos;t ask investors who say no for introductions to other investors.
That will in many cases be an anti-recommendation.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
This is not always as deliberate as its sounds.  A lot of the
delays and disconnects between founders and investors are induced
by the customs of the venture business, which have evolved the way
they have because they suit investors&apos; interests.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
One YC founder who read a draft of this essay wrote:
<blockquote>
  This is the most important section. I think it might bear stating
  even more clearly. &quot;Investors will deliberately affect more
  interest than they have to preserve optionality. If an investor
  seems very interested in you, they still probably won&apos;t invest.
  The solution for this is to assume the worst&#x2014;that an investor
  is just feigning interest&#x2014;until you get a definite commitment.&quot;
</blockquote>
[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
Though you should probably pack investor meetings as closely
as you can, Jeff Byun mentions one reason not to: if you pack
investor meetings too closely, you&apos;ll have less time for your pitch
to evolve.<br><br>Some founders deliberately schedule a handful of lame investors
first, to get the bugs out of their pitch.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
There is not an efficient market in this respect.  Some of the
most useless investors are also the highest maintenance.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
Incidentally, this paragraph is sales 101.  If you want to see
it in action, go talk to a car dealer.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
I know one very smooth founder who used to end investor meetings
with &quot;So, can I count you in?&quot; delivered as if it were &quot;Can you
pass the salt?&quot;   Unless you&apos;re very smooth (if you&apos;re not sure...),
do not do this yourself.  There is nothing more unconvincing, for
an investor, than a nerdy founder trying to deliver the lines meant
for a smooth one.<br><br>Investors are fine with funding nerds.  So if you&apos;re a nerd, just
try to be a good nerd, rather than doing a bad imitation of a smooth
salesman.<br><br>[<a name="f14n"><font color="#000000">14</font></a>]
Ian Hogarth suggests a good way to tell how serious potential
investors are: the resources they expend on you after the first
meeting.  An investor who&apos;s seriously interested will already be
working to help you even before they&apos;ve committed.<br><br>[<a name="f15n"><font color="#000000">15</font></a>]
In principle you might have to think about so-called &quot;signalling
risk.&quot;  If a prestigious VC makes a small seed investment in you,
what if they don&apos;t want to invest the next time you raise money?
Other investors might assume that the VC knows you well, since
they&apos;re an existing investor, and if they don&apos;t want to invest in
your next round, that must mean you suck.  The reason I say &quot;in
principle&quot; is that in practice signalling hasn&apos;t been much of a
problem so far.  It rarely arises, and in the few cases where it
does, the startup in question usually is doing badly and is doomed
anyway.<br><br>If you have the luxury of choosing among seed investors, you can
play it safe by excluding VC firms.  But it isn&apos;t critical to.<br><br>[<a name="f16n"><font color="#000000">16</font></a>]
Sometimes a competitor will deliberately threaten you with a
lawsuit just as you start fundraising, because they know you&apos;ll
have to disclose the threat to potential investors and they hope
this will make it harder for you to raise money.  If this happens
it will probably frighten you more than investors.  Experienced
investors know about this trick, and know the actual lawsuits rarely
happen. So if you&apos;re attacked in this way, be forthright with
investors.  They&apos;ll be more alarmed if you seem evasive than if you
tell them everything.<br><br>[<a name="f17n"><font color="#000000">17</font></a>]
A related trick is to claim that they&apos;ll only invest contingently
on other investors doing so because otherwise you&apos;d be &quot;undercapitalized.&quot;
This is almost always bullshit.  They can&apos;t estimate your minimum
capital needs that precisely.<br><br>[<a name="f18n"><font color="#000000">18</font></a>]
You won&apos;t hire all those 20 people at once, and you&apos;ll probably
have some revenues before 18 months are out.  But those too are
acceptable or at least accepted additions to the margin for error.<br><br>[<a name="f19n"><font color="#000000">19</font></a>]
Type A fundraising is so much better that it might even be
worth doing something different if it gets you there sooner.  One
YC founder told me that if he were a first-time founder again he&apos;d
&quot;leave ideas that are up-front capital intensive to founders with
established reputations.&quot;<br><br>[<a name="f20n"><font color="#000000">20</font></a>]
I don&apos;t know whether this happens because they&apos;re innumerate,
or because they believe they have zero ability to predict startup
outcomes (in which case this behavior at least wouldn&apos;t be irrational).
In either case the implications are similar.<br><br>[<a name="f21n"><font color="#000000">21</font></a>]
If you&apos;re a YC startup and you have an investor who for some
reason insists that you decide the price, any YC partner can estimate
a market price for you.<br><br>[<a name="f22n"><font color="#000000">22</font></a>]
You should respond in kind when investors behave upstandingly
too.  When an investor makes you a clean offer with no deadline,
you have a moral obligation to respond promptly.<br><br>[<a name="f23n"><font color="#000000">23</font></a>]
Tell the investors talking to you about an A round about the
smaller investments you raise as you raise them.  You owe them such
updates on your cap table, and this is also a good way to pressure
them to act.  They won&apos;t like you raising other money and may
pressure you to stop, but they can&apos;t legitimately ask you to commit
to them till they also commit to you.  If they want you to stop
raising money, the way to do it is to give you a series A termsheet
with a no-shop clause.<br><br>You can relent a little if the potential series A investor has a
great reputation and they&apos;re clearly working fast to get you a
termsheet, particularly if a third party like YC is involved to
ensure there are no misunderstandings.  But be careful.<br><br>[<a name="f24n"><font color="#000000">24</font></a>]
The company is Weebly, which made it to profitability on a
seed investment of $650k.  They did try to raise a series A in the
fall of 2008 but (no doubt partly because it was the fall of 2008)
the terms they were offered were so bad that they decided to skip
raising an A round.<br><br>[<a name="f25n"><font color="#000000">25</font></a>]
Another advantage of having one founder take fundraising
meetings is that you never have to negotiate in real time, which
is something inexperienced founders should avoid.  One YC founder
told me:
<blockquote>
  Investors are professional negotiators and can negotiate on the
  spot very easily.  If only one founder is in the room, you can
  say &quot;I need to circle back with my co-founder&quot; before making any
  commitments. I used to do this all the time.
</blockquote>
[<a name="f26n"><font color="#000000">26</font></a>]
You&apos;ll be lucky if fundraising feels pleasant enough to become
addictive.  More often you have to worry about the other
extreme&#x2014;becoming demoralized when investors reject you.  As
one (very successful) YC founder wrote after reading a draft of
this:
<blockquote>
  It&apos;s hard to mentally deal with the sheer scale of rejection in
  fundraising and if you are not in the right mindset you will fail.
  Users may love you but these supposedly smart investors may not
  understand you at all. At this point for me, rejection still
  rankles but I&apos;ve come to accept that investors are just not super
  thoughtful for the most part and you need to play the game according
  to certain somewhat depressing rules (many of which you are
  listing) in order to win.
</blockquote>

October 2014<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a guest lecture in Sam Altman&apos;s <a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/">startup class</a> at
Stanford.  It&apos;s intended for college students, but much of it is
applicable to potential founders at other ages.)</i><br><br>One of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to give
advice, you can ask yourself &quot;what would I tell my own kids?&quot;  My
kids are little, but I can imagine what I&apos;d tell them about startups
if they were in college, and that&apos;s what I&apos;m going to tell you.<br><br>Startups are very counterintuitive.  I&apos;m not sure why.  Maybe it&apos;s
just because knowledge about them hasn&apos;t permeated our culture yet.
But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you
can&apos;t always trust your instincts.<br><br>It&apos;s like skiing in that way.  When you first try skiing and you
want to slow down, your instinct is to lean back.  But if you lean
back on skis you fly down the hill out of control.  So part of
learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse.  Eventually
you get new habits, but at first it takes a conscious effort.  At
first there&apos;s a list of things you&apos;re trying to remember as you
start down the hill.<br><br>Startups are as unnatural as skiing, so there&apos;s a similar list for
startups. Here I&apos;m going to give you the first part of it&#x2014;the things
to remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup.<br><br>
<b>Counterintuitive</b><br><br>The first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups
are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you&apos;ll make a lot
of mistakes.  If you know nothing more than this, you may at least
pause before making them.<br><br>When I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our function
was to tell founders things they would ignore.  It&apos;s really true.
Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about mistakes
they&apos;re about to make, and the founders ignore them, and then come
back a year later and say &quot;I wish we&apos;d listened.&quot;<br><br>Why do the founders ignore the partners&apos; advice?  Well, that&apos;s the
thing about counterintuitive ideas: they contradict your intuitions.
They seem wrong.  So of course your first impulse is to disregard
them.  And in fact my joking description is not merely the curse
of Y Combinator but part of its raison d&apos;etre. If founders&apos; instincts
already gave them the right answers, they wouldn&apos;t need us.  You
only need other people to give you advice that surprises you. That&apos;s
why there are a lot of ski instructors and not many running
instructors.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>You can, however, trust your instincts about people.  And in fact
one of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to
do that enough.  They get involved with people who seem impressive,
but about whom they feel some misgivings personally.  Later when
things blow up they say &quot;I knew there was something off about him,
but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive.&quot;<br><br>If you&apos;re thinking about getting involved with someone&#x2014;as a
cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer&#x2014;and you
have misgivings about them, trust your gut.  If someone seems
slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don&apos;t ignore it.<br><br>This is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent. Work with
people you genuinely like, and you&apos;ve known long enough to be sure.<br><br>
<b>Expertise</b><br><br>The second counterintuitive point is that it&apos;s not that important
to know a lot about startups.  The way to succeed in a startup is
not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users
and the problem you&apos;re solving for them.
Mark Zuckerberg didn&apos;t succeed because he was an expert on startups.
He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups, because he
understood his users really well.<br><br>If you don&apos;t know anything about, say, how to raise an angel round,
don&apos;t feel bad on that account.  That sort of thing you can learn
when you need to, and forget after you&apos;ve done it.<br><br>In fact, I worry it&apos;s not merely unnecessary to learn in great
detail about the mechanics of startups, but possibly somewhat
dangerous.  If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible
notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I
wouldn&apos;t think &quot;here is someone who is way ahead of their peers.&quot;
It would set off alarms.  Because another of the characteristic
mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting
a startup.  They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money
at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people.
From the outside that seems like what startups do.  But the next
step after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually
realize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all
the outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thing
that&apos;s actually essential: making something people want.<br><br>
<b>Game</b><br><br>We saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing
house.  Eventually I realized why it was happening.  The reason
young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is
because that&apos;s what they&apos;ve been trained to do for their whole lives
up to that point.  Think about what you have to do to get into
college, for example.  Extracurricular activities, check.  Even in
college classes most of the work is as artificial as running laps.<br><br>I&apos;m not attacking the educational system for being this way. There
will always be a certain amount of fakeness in the work you do when
you&apos;re being taught something, and if you measure their performance
it&apos;s inevitable that people will exploit the difference to the point
where much of what you&apos;re measuring is artifacts of the fakeness.<br><br>I confess I did it myself in college. I found that in a lot of
classes there might only be 20 or 30 ideas that were the right shape
to make good exam questions.  The way I studied for exams in these
classes was not (except incidentally) to master the material taught
in the class, but to make a list of potential exam questions and
work out the answers in advance. When I walked into the final, the
main thing I&apos;d be feeling was curiosity about which of my questions
would turn up on the exam.  It was like a game.<br><br>It&apos;s not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives
to play such games, young founders&apos; first impulse on starting a
startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new
game. Since fundraising appears to be the measure of success for
startups (another classic noob mistake), they always want to know what the
tricks are for convincing investors.  We tell them the best way to
<a href="convince.html">convince investors</a> is to make a startup
that&apos;s actually doing well, meaning <a href="growth.html">growing fast</a>, and then simply
tell investors so.  Then they want to know what the tricks are for
growing fast.  And we have to tell them the best way to do that is
simply to make something people want.<br><br>So many of the conversations YC partners have with young founders
begin with the founder asking &quot;How do we...&quot; and the partner replying
&quot;Just...&quot;<br><br>Why do the founders always make things so complicated?  The reason,
I realized, is that they&apos;re looking for the trick.<br><br>So this is the third counterintuitive thing to remember about
startups: starting a startup is where gaming the system stops
working.  Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work
for a big company. Depending on how broken the company is, you can
succeed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impression
of productivity, and so on. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
But that doesn&apos;t work with startups.
There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is
whether your product does what they want. Startups are as impersonal
as physics.  You have to make something people want, and you prosper
only to the extent you do.<br><br>The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors.
If you&apos;re super good at sounding like you know what you&apos;re talking
about, you can fool investors for at least one and perhaps even two
rounds of funding.  But it&apos;s not in your interest to.  The company
is ultimately doomed.  All you&apos;re doing is wasting your own time
riding it down.<br><br>So stop looking for the trick. There are tricks in startups, as
there are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less
important than solving the real problem. A founder who knows nothing
about fundraising but has made something users love will have an
easier time raising money than one who knows every trick in the
book but has a flat usage graph. And more importantly, the founder
who has made something users love is the one who will go on to
succeed after raising the money.<br><br>Though in a sense it&apos;s bad news in that you&apos;re deprived of one of
your most powerful weapons, I think it&apos;s exciting that gaming the
system stops working when you start a startup.  It&apos;s exciting that
there even exist parts of the world where you win by doing good
work.  Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were all
like school and big companies, where you either have to spend a lot
of time on bullshit things or lose to people who do.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
I would
have been delighted if I&apos;d realized in college that there were parts
of the real world where gaming the system mattered less than others,
and a few where it hardly mattered at all.  But there are, and this
variation is one of the most important things to consider when
you&apos;re thinking about your future.  How do you win in each type of
work, and what would you like to win by doing?
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>All-Consuming</b><br><br>That brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point: startups are
all-consuming.  If you start a startup, it will take over your life
to a degree you cannot imagine.  And if your startup succeeds, it
will take over your life for a long time: for several years at the
very least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your working
life.  So there is a real opportunity cost here.<br><br>Larry Page may seem to have an enviable life, but there are aspects
of it that are unenviable.  Basically at 25 he started running as
fast as he could and it must seem to him that he hasn&apos;t stopped to
catch his breath since.  Every day new shit happens in the Google
empire that only the CEO can deal with, and he, as CEO, has to deal
with it.  If he goes on vacation for even a week, a whole week&apos;s
backlog of shit accumulates.  And he has to bear this uncomplainingly,
partly because as the company&apos;s daddy he can never show fear or
weakness, and partly because billionaires get less than zero sympathy
if they talk about having difficult lives.  Which has the strange
side effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder
is concealed from almost everyone except those who&apos;ve done it.<br><br>Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called
big successes, and in every single case the founders say the same
thing.  It never gets any easier.  The nature of the problems change.
You&apos;re worrying about construction delays at your London office
instead of the broken air conditioner in your studio apartment.
But the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything it
increases.<br><br>Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids in that
it&apos;s like a button you push that changes your life irrevocably.
And while it&apos;s truly wonderful having kids, there are a lot of
things that are easier to do before you have them than after.  Many
of which will make you a better parent when you do have kids. And
since you can delay pushing the button for a while, most people in
rich countries do.<br><br>Yet when it comes to startups, a lot of people seem to think they&apos;re
supposed to start them while they&apos;re still in college.  Are you
crazy?  And what are the universities thinking?  They go out of
their way to ensure their students are well supplied with contraceptives,
and yet they&apos;re setting up entrepreneurship programs and startup
incubators left and right.<br><br>To be fair, the universities have their hand forced here.  A lot
of incoming students are interested in startups.  Universities are,
at least de facto, expected to prepare them for their careers.  So
students who want to start startups hope universities can teach
them about startups.  And whether universities can do this or not,
there&apos;s some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose applicants
to other universities that do.<br><br>Can universities teach students about startups?  Yes and no.  They
can teach students about startups, but as I explained before, this
is not what you need to know.  What you need to learn about are the
needs of your own users, and you can&apos;t do that until you actually
start the company.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
So starting a startup is intrinsically
something you can only really learn by doing it.  And it&apos;s impossible
to do that in college, for the reason I just explained: startups
take over your life.  You can&apos;t start a startup for real as a
student, because if you start a startup for real you&apos;re not a student
anymore. You may be nominally a student for a bit, but you won&apos;t even
be that for long.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Given this dichotomy, which of the two paths should you take?  Be
a real student and not start a startup, or start a real startup and
not be a student?  I can answer that one for you. Do not start a
startup in college.  How to start a startup is just a subset of a
bigger problem you&apos;re trying to solve: how to have a good life.
And though starting a startup can be part of a good life for a lot
of ambitious people, age 20 is not the optimal time to do it.
Starting a startup is like a brutally fast depth-first search.  Most
people should still be searching breadth-first at 20.<br><br>You can do things in your early 20s that you can&apos;t do as well before
or after, like plunge deeply into projects on a whim and travel
super cheaply with no sense of a deadline.  For unambitious people,
this sort of thing is the dreaded &quot;failure to launch,&quot; but for the
ambitious ones it can be an incomparably valuable sort of exploration.
If you start a startup at 20 and you&apos;re sufficiently successful,
you&apos;ll never get to do it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country.  He
can do other things most people can&apos;t, like charter jets to fly him
to foreign countries. But success has taken a lot of the serendipity
out of his life. Facebook is running him as much as he&apos;s running
Facebook. And while it can be very cool to be in the grip of a
project you consider your life&apos;s work, there are advantages to
serendipity too, especially early in life.  Among other things it
gives you more options to choose your life&apos;s work from.<br><br>There&apos;s not even a tradeoff here. You&apos;re not sacrificing anything
if you forgo starting a startup at 20, because you&apos;re more likely
to succeed if you wait.  In the unlikely case that you&apos;re 20 and
one of your side projects takes off like Facebook did, you&apos;ll face
a choice of running with it or not, and it may be reasonable to run
with it.  But the usual way startups take off is for the founders
to <a href="ds.html">make them</a> take off, and it&apos;s gratuitously
stupid to do that at 20.<br><br>
<b>Try</b><br><br>Should you do it at any age?  I realize I&apos;ve made startups sound
pretty hard.  If I haven&apos;t, let me try again: starting a startup
is really hard.  What if it&apos;s too hard?  How can you tell if you&apos;re
up to this challenge?<br><br>The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can&apos;t tell. Your
life so far may have given you some idea what your prospects might
be if you tried to become a mathematician, or a professional football
player.  But unless you&apos;ve had a very strange life you haven&apos;t done
much that was <a href="really.html">like</a> being a startup founder.
Starting a startup will change you a lot.  So what you&apos;re trying
to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into,
and who can do that?<br><br>For the past 9 years it was my job to predict whether people would
have what it took to start successful startups.  It was easy to
tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be over
that threshold.  The hard part was predicting how <xa href="relres.html">tough and ambitious they would become.  There
may be no one who has more experience at trying to predict that,
so I can tell you how much an expert can know about it, and the
answer is: not much.  I learned to keep a completely open mind about
which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.<br><br>The founders sometimes think they know. Some arrive feeling sure
they will ace Y Combinator as they&apos;ve aced every one of the (few,
artificial, easy) tests they&apos;ve faced in life so far.  Others arrive
wondering how they got in and hoping YC doesn&apos;t discover whatever
mistake caused it to accept them.  But there is little correlation
between founders&apos; initial attitudes and how well their companies
do.<br><br>I&apos;ve read that the same is true in the military&#x2014;that the
swaggering recruits are no more likely to turn out to be really
tough than the quiet ones. And probably for the same reason: that
the tests involved are so different from the ones in their previous
lives.<br><br>If you&apos;re absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably
shouldn&apos;t do it.  But if you&apos;re merely unsure whether you&apos;re up to
it, the only way to find out is to try.  Just not now.<br><br>
<b>Ideas</b><br><br>So if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do in
college?  There are only two things you need initially: an idea and
cofounders.  And the m.o. for getting both is the same.  Which leads
to our sixth and last counterintuitive point: that the way to get
startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.<br><br>I&apos;ve written a whole <a href="startupideas.html">essay</a> on this,
so I won&apos;t repeat it all here.  But the short version is that if
you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideas
you come up with will not merely be bad, but bad and plausible-sounding,
meaning you&apos;ll waste a lot of time on them before realizing they&apos;re
bad.<br><br>The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back.
Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas,
turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any
conscious effort.  In fact, so unconsciously that you don&apos;t even
realize at first that they&apos;re startup ideas.<br><br>This is not only possible, it&apos;s how Apple, Yahoo, Google, and
Facebook all got started.  None of these companies were even meant
to be companies at first.  They were all just side projects.  The
best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great
ideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject
them as ideas for companies.<br><br>Ok, so how do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideas
form in unconsciously?  (1) Learn a lot about things that matter,
then (2) work on problems that interest you (3) with people you
like and respect.  The third part, incidentally, is how you get
cofounders at the same time as the idea.<br><br>The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of &quot;learn a lot about
things that matter,&quot; I wrote &quot;become good at some technology.&quot; But
that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow.  What was
special about Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia was not that they were
experts in technology.  They were good at design, and perhaps even
more importantly, they were good at organizing groups and making
projects happen.  So you don&apos;t have to work on technology per se,
so long as you work on problems demanding enough to stretch you.<br><br>What kind of problems are those?  That is very hard to answer in
the general case.  History is full of examples of young people who
were working on important problems that <a href="marginal.html">no
one else</a> at the time thought were important, and in particular
that their parents didn&apos;t think were important.  On the other hand,
history is even fuller of examples of parents who thought their
kids were wasting their time and who were right.  So how do you
know when you&apos;re working on real stuff?
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>I know how <i>I</i> know.  Real problems are interesting, and I am
self-indulgent in the sense that I always want to work on interesting
things, even if no one else cares about them (in fact, especially
if no one else cares about them), and find it very hard to make
myself work on boring things, even if they&apos;re supposed to be
important.<br><br>My life is full of case after case where I worked on something just
because it seemed interesting, and it turned out later to be useful
in some worldly way.  <a href="http://ycombinator.com/start.html">Y
Combinator itself</a> was something I only did because it seemed
interesting. So I seem to have some sort of internal compass that
helps me out.  But I don&apos;t know what other people have in their
heads. Maybe if I think more about this I can come up with heuristics
for recognizing genuinely interesting problems, but for the moment
the best I can offer is the hopelessly question-begging advice that
if you have a taste for genuinely interesting problems, indulging
it energetically is the best way to prepare yourself for a startup.
And indeed, probably also the best way to live.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>But although I can&apos;t explain in the general case what counts as an
interesting problem, I can tell you about a large subset of them.
If you think of technology as something that&apos;s spreading like a
sort of fractal stain, every moving point on the edge represents
an interesting problem.  So one guaranteed way to turn your mind
into the type that has good startup ideas is to get yourself to the
leading edge of some technology&#x2014;to cause yourself, as Paul
Buchheit put it, to &quot;live in the future.&quot; When you reach that point,
ideas that will seem to other people uncannily prescient will seem
obvious to you.  You may not realize they&apos;re startup ideas, but
you&apos;ll know they&apos;re something that ought to exist.<br><br>For example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad student
of my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice over IP software.
He didn&apos;t mean it to be a startup, and he never tried to turn it
into one.  He just wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan without
paying for long distance calls, and since he was an expert on
networks it seemed obvious to him that the way to do it was turn
the sound into packets and ship it over the Internet. He never did
any more with his software than talk to his girlfriend, but this
is exactly the way the best startups get started.<br><br>So strangely enough the optimal thing to do in college if you want
to be a successful startup founder is not some sort of new, vocational
version of college focused on &quot;entrepreneurship.&quot; It&apos;s the classic
version of college as education for its own sake. If you want to
start a startup after college, what you should do in college is
learn powerful things.  And if you have genuine intellectual
curiosity, that&apos;s what you&apos;ll naturally tend to do if you just
follow your own inclinations.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain
expertise.  The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert
on search. And the way to become an expert on search was to be
driven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.<br><br>At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for
curiosity.  And you&apos;ll do it best if you introduce the ulterior
motive toward the end of the process.<br><br>So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders,
boiled down to two words: just learn.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Some founders listen more than others, and this tends to be a
<a href="word.html">predictor of success</a>. One of the things I
remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In fact, this is one of the reasons startups are possible.  If
big companies weren&apos;t plagued by internal inefficiencies, they&apos;d
be proportionately more effective, leaving less room for startups.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
In a startup you have to spend a lot of time on <a href="schlep.html">schleps</a>, but this sort of work is merely
unglamorous, not bogus.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
What should you do if your true calling is gaming the system?
Management consulting.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
The company may not be incorporated, but if you start to get
significant numbers of users, you&apos;ve started it, whether you realize
it yet or not.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
It shouldn&apos;t be that surprising that colleges can&apos;t teach
students how to be good startup founders, because they can&apos;t teach
them how to be good employees either.<br><br>The way universities &quot;teach&quot; students how to be employees is to
hand off the task to companies via internship programs.  But you
couldn&apos;t do the equivalent thing for startups, because by definition
if the students did well they would never come back.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Charles Darwin was 22 when he received an invitation to travel
aboard the HMS Beagle as a naturalist.  It was only because he was
otherwise unoccupied, to a degree that alarmed his family, that he
could accept it. And yet if he hadn&apos;t we probably would not know
his name.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Parents can sometimes be especially conservative in this
department.  There are some whose definition of important problems
includes only those on the critical path to med school.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
I did manage to think of a heuristic for detecting whether you
have a taste for interesting ideas: whether you find known boring
ideas intolerable.  Could you endure studying literary theory, or
working in middle management at a large company?<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
In fact, if your goal is to start a startup, you can stick
even more closely to the ideal of a liberal education than past
generations have. Back when students focused mainly on getting a
job after college, they thought at least a little about how the
courses they took might look to an employer.  And perhaps even
worse, they might shy away from taking a difficult class lest they
get a low grade, which would harm their all-important GPA.  Good
news: users <a href="credentials.html">don&apos;t care</a> what your GPA
was.  And I&apos;ve never heard of investors caring either.  Y Combinator
certainly never asks what classes you took in college or what grades
you got in them.<br><br>

are mean.  There are exceptions, but remarkably few.<br><br>Meanness isn&apos;t rare.  In fact, one of the things the internet has
shown us is how mean people can be.  A few decades ago, only famous
people and professional writers got to publish their opinions.  Now
everyone can, and we can all see the <xa href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpOEO2gUekE">long tail of
meanness that had previously been hidden.<br><br>And yet while there are clearly a lot of mean people out there,
there are next to none among the most successful people I know.
What&apos;s going on here?  Are meanness and success inversely correlated?<br><br>Part of what&apos;s going on, of course, is selection bias.  I only know
people who work in certain fields: startup founders, programmers,
professors. I&apos;m willing to believe that successful people in other
fields are mean.  Maybe successful hedge fund managers are mean; I
don&apos;t know enough to say.  It seems quite likely that most successful
drug lords are mean.  But there are at least big chunks of the world
that mean people don&apos;t rule, and that territory seems to be growing.<br><br>My wife and Y Combinator cofounder Jessica is one of those rare
people who have x-ray vision for character. Being married to her
is like standing next to an airport baggage scanner. She came to
the startup world from investment banking, and she has always been
struck both by how consistently successful startup founders turn
out to be good people, and how consistently bad people fail as
startup founders.<br><br>Why?  I think there are several reasons.  One is that being mean
makes you stupid. That&apos;s why I hate fights. You never do your best
work in a fight, because fights are not sufficiently general.
Winning is always a function of the situation and the people involved.
You don&apos;t win fights by thinking of big ideas but by thinking of
tricks that work in one particular case.  And yet fighting is just
as much work as thinking about real problems. Which is particularly
painful to someone who cares how their brain is used: your brain
goes fast but you get nowhere, like a car spinning its wheels.<br><br>Startups don&apos;t win by attacking. They win by transcending. There
are exceptions of course, but usually the way to win is to race
ahead, not to stop and fight.<br><br>Another reason mean founders lose is that they can&apos;t get the best
people to work for them. They can hire people who will put up with
them because they need a job. But the best people have other options.
A mean person can&apos;t convince the best people to work for him unless
he is super convincing. And while having the best people helps any
organization, it&apos;s critical for startups.<br><br>There is also a complementary force at work: if you want to build
great things, it helps to be driven by a spirit of <xa href="good.html">benevolence. The startup founders who end up
richest are not the ones driven by money.  The ones driven by money
take the big acquisition offer that nearly every successful startup
gets en route.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
The ones who keep going are driven by something
else. They may not say so explicitly, but they&apos;re usually trying
to improve the world.  Which means people with a desire to improve
the world have a natural advantage.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The exciting thing is that startups are not just one random type
of work in which meanness and success are inversely correlated.
This kind of work is the future.<br><br>For most of history success meant control of scarce resources.  One
got that by fighting, whether literally in the case of pastoral
nomads driving hunter-gatherers into marginal lands, or metaphorically
in the case of Gilded Age financiers contending with one another
to assemble railroad monopolies. For most of history, success meant
success at zero-sum games. And in most of them meanness was not a
handicap but probably an advantage.<br><br>That is changing. Increasingly the games that matter are not zero-sum.
Increasingly you win not by fighting to get control of a scarce
resource, but by having new ideas and building new things.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>There have long been games where you won by having new ideas. In
the third century BC Archimedes won by doing that. At least until
an invading Roman army killed him. Which illustrates why
this change is happening: for new ideas to matter, you need a certain
degree of civil order.  And not just not being at war.  You also
need to prevent the sort of economic violence that nineteenth century
magnates practiced against one another and communist countries
practiced against their citizens.  People need to feel that what
they create can&apos;t be stolen.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>That has always been the case for thinkers, which is why this trend
began with them.  When you think of successful people from history
who weren&apos;t ruthless, you get mathematicians and writers and artists.
The exciting thing is that their m.o. seems to be spreading.  The
games played by intellectuals are leaking into the real world, and
this is reversing the historical polarity of the relationship between
meanness and success.<br><br>So I&apos;m really glad I stopped to think about this. Jessica and I
have always worked hard to teach our kids not to be mean.  We
tolerate noise and mess and junk food, but not meanness.  And now
I have both an additional reason to crack down on it, and an
additional argument to use when I do: that being mean makes you
fail.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I&apos;m not saying all founders who take big acquisition offers
are driven only by money, but rather that those who don&apos;t aren&apos;t.
Plus one can have benevolent motives for being driven by money&#x2014;for 
example, to take care of one&apos;s family, or to be free to work
on projects that improve the world.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
It&apos;s unlikely that every successful startup improves the
world.  But their founders, like parents, truly believe they do.
Successful founders are in love with their companies.  And while
this sort of love is as blind as the love people have for one
another, it is genuine.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
<a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec05">Peter 
Thiel</a> would point out that successful founders still
get rich from controlling monopolies, just monopolies they create
rather than ones they capture.  And while this is largely true, it
means a big change in the sort of person who wins.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
To be fair, the Romans didn&apos;t mean to kill Archimedes.  The
Roman commander specifically ordered that he be spared. But he got
killed in the chaos anyway.<br><br>In sufficiently disordered times, even thinking requires

although they have a significant amount of money in the bank, they&apos;re
also losing a lot each month, and revenue growth is either nonexistent
or mediocre.  The company has, say, 6 months of runway.  Or to put
it more brutally, 6 months before they&apos;re out of business.  They
expect to avoid that by raising more from investors.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>That last sentence is the fatal one.<br><br>There may be nothing founders are so prone to delude themselves
about as how interested investors will be in giving them additional
funding.  It&apos;s hard to convince investors the first time too, but
founders expect that.  What bites them the second time is a confluence
of three forces:
<ol>
<li> The company is spending more now than it did the first time
  it raised money.<br><br></li><li> Investors have much higher standards for companies that have
  already raised money.<br><br></li><li> The company is now starting to read as a failure. The first
  time it raised money, it was neither a success nor a failure; it
  was too early to ask. Now it&apos;s possible to ask that question, and
  the default answer is failure, because that is at this point the
  default outcome.
</li></ol>
I&apos;m going to call the situation I described in the first paragraph &quot;the fatal pinch.&quot; I try to resist
coining phrases, but making up a name for this situation may snap
founders into realizing when they&apos;re in it.<br><br>One of the things that makes the fatal pinch so dangerous is
that it&apos;s self-reinforcing.  Founders overestimate their chances
of raising more money, and so are slack about reaching
profitability, which further decreases their chances of raising
money.<br><br>Now that you know about the fatal pinch, what do you do about
it?  Obviously the best thing to do is avoid it.  Y Combinator tells
founders who raise money to act as if it&apos;s the last they&apos;ll ever
get.  Because the self-reinforcing nature of this situation works
the other way too: the less you need further investment, the easier
it is to get.<br><br>What do you do if you&apos;re already in the fatal pinch?  The
first step is to re-evaluate the probability of raising more money.
I will now, by an amazing feat of clairvoyance, do this for you:
the probability is zero. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Three options remain: you can shut down the company, you can increase
how much you make, and you can decrease how much you spend.<br><br>You should shut down the company if you&apos;re certain it will
fail no matter what you do.  Then at least you can give back the
money you have left, and save yourself however many months you would
have spent riding it down.<br><br>Companies rarely <i>have</i> to fail though.  What I&apos;m really doing
here is giving you the option of admitting you&apos;ve already given up.<br><br>If you don&apos;t want to shut down the company, that leaves increasing
revenues and decreasing expenses.  In most startups, expenses =
people and decreasing expenses = firing people.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Deciding to
fire people is usually hard, but there&apos;s one case in which it
shouldn&apos;t be: when there are people you already know you should
fire but you&apos;re in denial about it.  If so, now&apos;s the time.<br><br>If that makes you profitable, or will enable you to make it to
profitability on the money you have left, you&apos;ve avoided the immediate
danger.<br><br>Otherwise you have three options: you either have to fire good
people, get some or all of the employees to take less salary for a
while, or increase revenues.<br><br>Getting people to take less salary is a weak solution that will
only work when the problem isn&apos;t too bad.  If your current trajectory
won&apos;t quite get you to profitability but you can get over the threshold
by cutting salaries a little,
you might be able to make the case to everyone for doing it.
Otherwise you&apos;re probably just postponing the problem, and that
will be obvious to the people whose salaries you&apos;re proposing to
cut.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Which leaves two options, firing good people and making more money.
While trying to balance them, keep in mind the eventual goal: to be
a successful product company in the sense of having a single thing
lots of people use.<br><br>You should lean more toward firing people if the source of your
trouble is overhiring. If you went out and hired 15 people before
you even knew what you were building, you&apos;ve created a broken
company.  You need to figure out what you&apos;re building, and it will
probably be easier to do that with a handful of people than 15.
Plus those 15 people might not even be the ones you need for whatever
you end up building.  So the solution may be to shrink and then
figure out what direction to grow in.  After all, you&apos;re not doing
those 15 people any favors if you fly the company into ground with
them aboard.  They&apos;ll all lose their jobs eventually, along with
all the time they expended on this doomed company.<br><br>Whereas if you only have a handful of people, it may be better to
focus on trying to make more money.  It may seem facile to suggest
a startup make more money, as if that could be done for the asking.
Usually a startup is already trying as hard as it can to sell
whatever it sells.  What I&apos;m suggesting here is not so much to try
harder to make money but to try to make money in a different way.
For example, if you have only one person selling while the rest are
writing code, consider having everyone work on selling.  What good
will more code do you when you&apos;re out of business?  
If you have to write code to close a certain deal, go ahead;
that follows from everyone working on selling.  But only work on
whatever will get you the most revenue the soonest.<br><br>Another way to make money differently is to sell different things,
and in particular to do more consultingish work.  I say consultingish
because there is a long slippery slope from making products to pure
consulting, and you don&apos;t have to go far down it before you start
to offer something really attractive to customers. Although your
product may not be very appealing yet, if you&apos;re a startup your
programmers will often be way better than the ones your customers
have or can hire.  Or you may have expertise in some new field they
don&apos;t understand.  So if you change your sales conversations
just a little from &quot;do you want to buy our product?&quot; to &quot;what do
you need that you&apos;d pay a lot for?&quot; you may find it&apos;s suddenly a
lot easier to extract money from customers.<br><br>Be ruthlessly mercenary when you start doing this though: you&apos;re
trying to save your company from death here, so make customers pay
a lot, quickly. And to the extent you can, try to avoid the
worst pitfalls of consulting.  The ideal thing might be if you built
a precisely defined derivative version of your product for the
customer, and it was otherwise a straight product sale.  You keep
the IP and no billing by the hour.<br><br>In the best case, this consultingish work may not be just something
you do to survive, but may turn out to be the <a href="ds.html">thing-that-doesn&apos;t-scale</a> that defines your
company.  Don&apos;t expect it to be, but as you dive into individual
users&apos; needs, keep your eyes open for narrow openings that have
wide vistas beyond.<br><br>There is usually so much demand for custom work that unless you&apos;re
really incompetent there has to be some point down the slope of
consulting at which you can survive.  But I didn&apos;t use the term
slippery slope by accident; customers&apos; insatiable demand for custom
work will always be pushing you toward the bottom.  So while you&apos;ll
probably survive, the problem now becomes to survive with the least
damage and distraction.<br><br>The good news is, plenty of successful startups have passed through
near-death experiences and gone on to flourish.  You just have to
realize in time that you&apos;re near death.  And if you&apos;re in the fatal pinch,
you are.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
There are a handful of companies that can&apos;t reasonably expect
to make money for the first year or two, because what they&apos;re
building takes so long.  For these companies substitute &quot;progress&quot;
for &quot;revenue growth.&quot;  You&apos;re not one of these companies unless
your initial investors agreed in advance that you were.  And frankly
even these companies wish they weren&apos;t, because the illiquidity of
&quot;progress&quot; puts them at the mercy of investors.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There&apos;s a variant of the fatal pinch where your existing
investors help you along by promising to invest more.  Or rather,
where you read them as promising to invest more, while they think
they&apos;re just mentioning the possibility.  The way to solve this
problem, if you have 8 months of runway or less, is to try to get
the money right now.  Then you&apos;ll either get the money, in which
case (immediate) problem solved, or at least prevent your investors
from helping you to remain in denial about your fundraising prospects.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Obviously, if you have significant expenses other than salaries
that you can eliminate, do it now.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Unless of course the source of the problem is that you&apos;re paying
yourselves high salaries.  If by cutting the founders&apos; salaries to
the minimum you need, you can make it to profitability, you should.
But it&apos;s a bad sign if you needed to read this to realize that.<br><br>

two times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything
I remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a
page.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy
feeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all
these books if I remember so little from them?<br><br>A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid&apos;s excellent
biography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this
question, at least something that made me feel better about it.
She writes:
<blockquote>
  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled
  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a
  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that &quot;a perfect
  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.&quot;
</blockquote>
That has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even
more convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.<br><br>But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A
combination of my own experience and other things I&apos;d read.  None
of which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I&apos;d forget
that Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the
importance of this idea would remain something I&apos;d learned from
this book, even after I&apos;d forgotten I&apos;d learned it.<br><br>Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if
you forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model
of the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you&apos;ve
lost the source of.  It works, but you don&apos;t know why.<br><br>The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin&apos;s chronicle
is not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,
Venice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn&apos;t
mean I couldn&apos;t have read more attentively, but at least the harvest
of reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.<br><br>This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But
it was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who
felt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they&apos;d read.<br><br>Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about
forgetting, though.  There are specific implications.<br><br>For example, reading and experience are usually &quot;compiled&quot; at the
time they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The
same book would get compiled differently at different points in
your life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important
books multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about
rereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work
like carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you
did it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase &quot;already read&quot;
seems almost ill-formed.<br><br>Intriguingly, this implication isn&apos;t limited to books.  Technology
will increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When
people do that today it&apos;s usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when
looking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in
their compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering
the childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as
technologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it
may become common for people to relive experiences without any goal
in mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading
a book.<br><br>Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but
also to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you
know things may seem part of being human, it may not be.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

confidence in our beliefs.  The more (and more varied) experience
a belief survived, the less likely it would be false.  Most people
implicitly believe something like this about their opinions.  And
they&apos;re justified in doing so with opinions about things that don&apos;t
change much, like human nature.  But you can&apos;t trust your opinions
in the same way about things that change, which could include
practically everything else.<br><br>When experts are wrong, it&apos;s often because they&apos;re experts on an
earlier version of the world.<br><br>Is it possible to avoid that?  Can you protect yourself against
obsolete beliefs?  To some extent, yes. I spent almost a decade
investing in early stage startups, and curiously enough protecting
yourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do
to succeed as a startup investor.  Most really good startup ideas
look like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically
because some change in the world just switched them from bad to
good.  I spent a lot of time learning to recognize such ideas, and
the techniques I used may be applicable to ideas in general.<br><br>The first step is to have an explicit belief in change.  People who
fall victim to a monotonically increasing confidence in their
opinions are implicitly concluding the world is static.  If you
consciously remind yourself it isn&apos;t, you start to look for change.<br><br>Where should one look for it?  Beyond the moderately useful
generalization that human nature doesn&apos;t change much, the unfortunate
fact is that change is hard to predict.  This is largely a tautology
but worth remembering all the same: change that matters usually
comes from an unforeseen quarter.<br><br>So I don&apos;t even try to predict it.  When I get asked in interviews
to predict the future, I always have to struggle to come up with
something plausible-sounding on the fly, like a student who hasn&apos;t
prepared for an exam.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
But it&apos;s not out of laziness that I haven&apos;t
prepared.  It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so
rarely correct that they usually aren&apos;t worth the extra rigidity
they impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively
open-minded.  Instead of trying to point yourself in the right
direction, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, and
try instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change.<br><br>It&apos;s ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain
you a bit, because they also motivate you.  It&apos;s exciting to chase
things and exciting to try to guess answers.  But you have to be
disciplined about not letting your hypotheses harden into anything
more.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>I believe this passive m.o. works not just for evaluating new ideas
but also for having them.  The way to come up with new ideas is not
to try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply not
discount weird hunches you have in the process.<br><br>The winds of change originate in the unconscious minds of domain
experts.  If you&apos;re sufficiently expert in a field, any weird idea
or apparently irrelevant question that occurs to you is ipso facto
worth exploring. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
 Within Y Combinator, when an idea is described
as crazy, it&apos;s a compliment&#x2014;in fact, on average probably a
higher compliment than when an idea is described as good.<br><br>Startup investors have extraordinary incentives for correcting
obsolete beliefs.  If they can realize before other investors that
some apparently unpromising startup isn&apos;t, they can make a huge
amount of money.  But the incentives are more than just financial.
Investors&apos; opinions are explicitly tested: startups come to them
and they have to say yes or no, and then, fairly quickly, they learn
whether they guessed right.  The investors who say no to a Google
(and there were several) will remember it for the rest of their
lives.<br><br>Anyone who must in some sense bet on ideas rather than merely
commenting on them has similar incentives.  Which means anyone who
wants to have such incentives can, by turning their comments into
bets: if you write about a topic in some fairly durable and public
form, you&apos;ll find you worry much more about getting things right
than most people would in a casual conversation.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another trick I&apos;ve found to protect myself against obsolete beliefs
is to focus initially on people rather than ideas. Though the nature
of future discoveries is hard to predict, I&apos;ve found I can predict
quite well what sort of people will make them.  Good new ideas come
from earnest, energetic, independent-minded people.<br><br>Betting on people over ideas saved me countless times as an investor.
We thought Airbnb was a bad idea, for example. But we could tell
the founders were earnest, energetic, and independent-minded.
(Indeed, almost pathologically so.)  So we suspended disbelief and
funded them.<br><br>This too seems a technique that should be generally applicable.
Surround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from.  If
you want to notice quickly when your beliefs become obsolete, you
can&apos;t do better than to be friends with the people whose discoveries
will make them so.<br><br>It&apos;s hard enough already not to become the prisoner of your own
expertise, but it will only get harder, because change is accelerating.
That&apos;s not a recent trend; change has been accelerating since the
paleolithic era.  Ideas beget ideas.  I don&apos;t expect that to change.
But I could be wrong.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
My usual trick is to talk about aspects of the present that
most people haven&apos;t noticed yet.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Especially if they become well enough known that people start
to identify them with you.  You have to be extra skeptical about
things you want to believe, and once a hypothesis starts to be
identified with you, it will almost certainly start to be in that
category.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
In practice &quot;sufficiently expert&quot; doesn&apos;t require one to be
recognized as an expert&#x2014;which is a trailing indicator in any
case.  In many fields a year of focused work plus caring a lot would
be enough.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Though they are public and persist indefinitely, comments on
e.g. forums and places like Twitter seem empirically to work like
casual conversation.  The threshold may be whether what you write

easier because they say they can&apos;t find enough programmers in the
US.  Anti-immigration people say that instead of letting foreigners
take these jobs, we should train more Americans to be programmers.
Who&apos;s right?<br><br>The technology companies are right. What the anti-immigration people
don&apos;t understand is that there is a huge variation in ability between
competent programmers and exceptional ones, and while you can train
people to be competent, you can&apos;t train them to be exceptional.
Exceptional programmers have an aptitude for and interest in
programming that is not merely the product of training.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The US has less than 5% of the world&apos;s population.  Which means if
the qualities that make someone a great programmer are evenly
distributed, 95% of great programmers are born outside the US.<br><br>The anti-immigration people have to invent some explanation to
account for all the effort technology companies have expended trying
to make immigration easier.  So they claim it&apos;s because they want
to drive down salaries.  But if you talk to startups, you find
practically every one over a certain size has gone through legal
contortions to get programmers into the US, where they then
paid them the same as they&apos;d have paid an American.  Why would they
go to extra trouble to get programmers for the same price?  The
only explanation is that they&apos;re telling the truth: there are just
not enough great programmers to go around.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>I asked the CEO of a startup with about 70 programmers how many
more he&apos;d hire if he could get all the great programmers he wanted.
He said &quot;We&apos;d hire 30 tomorrow morning.&quot;  And this is one of the
hot startups that always win recruiting battles. It&apos;s the same all
over Silicon Valley.  Startups are that constrained for talent.<br><br>It would be great if more Americans were trained as programmers,
but no amount of training can flip a ratio as overwhelming as 95
to 5. Especially since programmers are being trained in other
countries too.  Barring some cataclysm, it will always be true that
most great programmers are born outside the US.  It will always be
true that most people who are great at anything are born outside
the US.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Exceptional performance implies immigration.  A country with only
a few percent of the world&apos;s population will be exceptional in some
field only if there are a lot of immigrants working in it.<br><br>But this whole discussion has taken something for granted: that if
we let more great programmers into the US, they&apos;ll want to come.
That&apos;s true now, and we don&apos;t realize how lucky we are that it is.
If we want to keep this option open, the best way to do it is to
take advantage of it: the more of the world&apos;s great programmers are
here, the more the rest will want to come here.<br><br>And if we don&apos;t, the US could be seriously fucked. I realize that&apos;s
strong language, but the people dithering about this don&apos;t seem to
realize the power of the forces at work here.  Technology gives the
best programmers huge leverage.  The world market in programmers
seems to be becoming dramatically more liquid.  And since good
people like good colleagues, that means the best programmers could
collect in just a few hubs.  Maybe mostly in one hub.<br><br>What if most of the great programmers collected in one hub, and it
wasn&apos;t here?  That scenario may seem unlikely now, but it won&apos;t be
if things change as much in the next 50 years as they did in the
last 50.<br><br>We have the potential to ensure that the US remains a technology
superpower just by letting in a few thousand great programmers a
year.  What a colossal mistake it would be to let that opportunity
slip.  It could easily be the defining mistake this generation of
American politicians later become famous for.  And unlike other
potential mistakes on that scale, it costs nothing to fix.<br><br>So please, get on with it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
How much better is a great programmer than an ordinary one?
So much better that you can&apos;t even measure the difference directly.
A great programmer doesn&apos;t merely do the same work faster.  A great
programmer will invent things an ordinary programmer would never
even think of.  This doesn&apos;t mean a great programmer is infinitely
more valuable, because any invention has a finite market value.
But it&apos;s easy to imagine cases where a great programmer might invent
things worth 100x or even 1000x an average programmer&apos;s salary.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There are a handful of consulting firms that rent out big
pools of foreign programmers they bring in on H1-B visas.  By all
means crack down on these.  It should be easy to write legislation
that distinguishes them, because they are so different from technology
companies.  But it is dishonest of the anti-immigration people to
claim that companies like Google and Facebook are driven by the
same motives.  An influx of inexpensive but mediocre programmers
is the last thing they&apos;d want; it would destroy them.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Though this essay talks about programmers, the group of people
we need to import is broader, ranging from designers to programmers
to electrical engineers.  The best one could do as a general term
might be &quot;digital talent.&quot; It seemed better to make the argument a
little too narrow than to confuse everyone with a neologism.<br><br>

that buys other companies. If you&apos;re talking to someone from corp
dev, that&apos;s why, whether you realize it yet or not.<br><br>It&apos;s usually a mistake to talk to corp dev unless (a) you want to
sell your company right now and (b) you&apos;re sufficiently likely to
get an offer at an acceptable price.  In practice that means startups
should only talk to corp dev when they&apos;re either doing really well
or really badly.  If you&apos;re doing really badly, meaning the company
is about to die, you may as well talk to them, because you have
nothing to lose. And if you&apos;re doing really well, you can safely
talk to them, because you both know the price will have to be high,
and if they show the slightest sign of wasting your time, you&apos;ll
be confident enough to tell them to get lost.<br><br>The danger is to companies in the middle.  Particularly to young
companies that are growing fast, but haven&apos;t been doing it for long
enough to have grown big yet.  It&apos;s usually a mistake for a promising
company less than a year old even to talk to corp dev.<br><br>But it&apos;s a mistake founders constantly make.  When someone from
corp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should
at least find out what they want.  Besides, they don&apos;t want to
offend Big Company by refusing to meet.<br><br>Well, I&apos;ll tell you what they want.  They want to talk about buying
you.  That&apos;s what the title &quot;corp dev&quot; means.   So before agreeing
to meet with someone from corp dev, ask yourselves, &quot;Do we want to
sell the company right now?&quot;  And if the answer is no, tell them
&quot;Sorry, but we&apos;re focusing on growing the company.&quot;  They won&apos;t be
offended.  And certainly the founders of Big Company won&apos;t be
offended. If anything they&apos;ll think more highly of you.  You&apos;ll
remind them of themselves.  They didn&apos;t sell either; that&apos;s why
they&apos;re in a position now to buy other companies.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Most founders who get contacted by corp dev already know what it
means.  And yet even when they know what corp dev does and know
they don&apos;t want to sell, they take the meeting.  Why do they do it?
The same mix of denial and wishful thinking that underlies most
mistakes founders make. It&apos;s flattering to talk to someone who wants
to buy you.  And who knows, maybe their offer will be surprisingly
high.  You should at least see what it is, right?<br><br>No.  If they were going to send you an offer immediately by email,
sure, you might as well open it.  But that is not how conversations
with corp dev work.  If you get an offer at all, it will be at the
end of a long and unbelievably distracting process.  And if the
offer is surprising, it will be surprisingly low.<br><br>Distractions are the thing you can least afford in a startup.  And
conversations with corp dev are the worst sort of distraction,
because as well as consuming your <a href="top.html">attention</a> they undermine your
morale.  One of the tricks to surviving a grueling process is not
to stop and think how tired you are.  Instead you get into a sort
of flow. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Imagine what it would do to you if at mile 20 of a
marathon, someone ran up beside you and said &quot;You must feel really
tired.  Would you like to stop and take a rest?&quot;  Conversations
with corp dev are like that but worse, because the suggestion of
stopping gets combined in your mind with the imaginary high price
you think they&apos;ll offer.<br><br>And then you&apos;re really in trouble.  If they can, corp dev people
like to turn the tables on you. They like to get you to the point
where you&apos;re trying to convince them to buy instead of them trying
to convince you to sell.  And surprisingly often they succeed.<br><br>This is a very slippery slope, greased with some of the most powerful
forces that can work on founders&apos; minds, and attended by an experienced
professional whose full time job is to push you down it.<br><br>Their tactics in pushing you down that slope are usually fairly
brutal. Corp dev people&apos;s whole job is to buy companies, and they
don&apos;t even get to choose which.  The only way their performance is
measured is by how cheaply they can buy you, and the more ambitious
ones will stop at nothing to achieve that. For example, they&apos;ll
almost always start with a lowball offer, just to see if you&apos;ll
take it. Even if you don&apos;t, a low initial offer will demoralize you
and make you easier to manipulate.<br><br>And that is the most innocent of their tactics. Just wait till
you&apos;ve agreed on a price and think you have a done deal, and then
they come back and say their boss has vetoed the deal and won&apos;t do
it for more than half the agreed upon price. Happens all the time.
If you think investors can behave badly, it&apos;s nothing compared to
what corp dev people can do.  Even corp dev people at companies
that are otherwise benevolent.  I remember once complaining to a
friend at Google about some nasty trick their corp dev people had
pulled on a YC startup. &quot;What happened to Don&apos;t be Evil?&quot; I asked.
&quot;I don&apos;t think corp dev got the memo,&quot; he replied.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The tactics you encounter in M&amp;A conversations can be like nothing
you&apos;ve experienced in the otherwise comparatively 
<a href="mean.html">upstanding</a> world
of Silicon Valley.  It&apos;s as if a chunk of genetic material from the
old-fashioned robber baron business world got incorporated into the
startup world.<br><br>The simplest way to protect yourself is to use the trick that John
D. Rockefeller, whose grandfather was an alcoholic, used to protect
himself from becoming one.  He once told a Sunday school class
<blockquote>
  Boys, do you know why I never became a drunkard?  Because I never
  took the first drink.
</blockquote>
Do you want to sell your company right now?  Not eventually, right
now.  If not, just don&apos;t take the first meeting.  They won&apos;t be
offended.  And you in turn will be guaranteed to be spared one of
the worst experiences that can happen to a startup.<br><br>If you do want to sell, there&apos;s another set of 
<a href="http://justinkan.com/the-founders-guide-to-selling-your-company">techniques
</a> for doing
that.  But the biggest mistake founders make in dealing with corp
dev is not doing a bad job of talking to them when they&apos;re ready
to, but talking to them before they are.  So if you remember only
the title of this essay, you already know most of what you need to
know about M&amp;A in the first year.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I&apos;m not saying you should never sell.  I&apos;m saying you should
be clear in your own mind about whether you want to sell or not,
and not be led by manipulation or wishful thinking into trying to
sell earlier than you otherwise would have.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In a startup, as in most competitive sports, the task at hand
almost does this for you; you&apos;re too busy to feel tired.  But when
you lose that protection, e.g. at the final whistle, the fatigue
hits you like a wave.  To talk to corp dev is to let yourself feel
it mid-game.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
To be fair, the apparent misdeeds of corp dev people are magnified
by the fact that they function as the face of a large organization
that often doesn&apos;t know its own mind.  Acquirers can be surprisingly
indecisive about acquisitions, and their flakiness is indistinguishable
from dishonesty by the time it filters down to you.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Marc Andreessen, Jessica Livingston, Geoff

For most of my childhood he worked
for Westinghouse, modelling nuclear reactors.<br><br>He was one of those lucky people who know early on what they want to
do.  When you talk to him about his childhood, there&apos;s a clear
watershed at about age 12, when he &quot;got interested in maths.&quot;  He
grew up in the small Welsh seacoast town of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rkzUm">Pwllheli</a>.  As we retraced
his walk to school on Google Street View, he said that it had been
nice growing up in the country.<br><br>&quot;Didn&apos;t it get boring when you got to be about 15?&quot; I asked.<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;by then I was interested in maths.&quot;<br><br>In another conversation he told me that what he really liked was
solving problems.  To me the exercises at the end of each chapter
in a math textbook represent work, or at best a way to reinforce
what you learned in that chapter.  To him the problems were the
reward.  The text of each chapter was just some advice about solving
them. He said that as soon as he got a new textbook he&apos;d immediately
work out all the problems&#x2014;to the slight annoyance of his teacher,
since the class was supposed to work through the book gradually.<br><br>Few people know so early or so certainly what they want to work on.
But talking to my father reminded me of a heuristic the rest of us
can use. If something that seems like work to other people doesn&apos;t
seem like work to you, that&apos;s something you&apos;re well suited for.
For example, a lot of programmers I know, including me, actually
like debugging.  It&apos;s not something people tend to volunteer; one
likes it the way one likes popping zits. But you may have to like
debugging to like programming, considering the degree to which
programming consists of it.<br><br>The stranger your tastes seem to other people, the stronger evidence
they probably are of what you should do. When I was in college I
used to write papers for my friends.  It was quite interesting to
write a paper for a class I wasn&apos;t taking.  Plus they were always
so relieved.<br><br>It seemed curious that the same task could be painful to one person
and pleasant to another, but I didn&apos;t realize at the time what this
imbalance implied, because I wasn&apos;t looking for it.  I didn&apos;t realize
how hard it can be to decide what you should work on, and that you
sometimes have to <a href="love.html">figure it out</a> from subtle clues, like a detective
solving a case in a mystery novel.  So I bet it would help a lot
of people to ask themselves about this explicitly. What seems like
work to other people that doesn&apos;t seem like work to you?<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Ron Conway.  He knows what happened in every deal in the Valley,
half the time because he arranged it.<br><br>And yet he&apos;s a super nice guy.  In fact, nice is not the word.
Ronco is good. I know of zero instances in which he has behaved
badly.  It&apos;s hard even to imagine.<br><br>When I first came to Silicon Valley I thought &quot;How lucky that someone
so powerful is so benevolent.&quot;  But gradually I realized it wasn&apos;t
luck.  It was by being benevolent that Ronco became so powerful.
All the deals he gets to invest in come to him through referrals.
Google did. Facebook did. Twitter was a referral from Evan Williams
himself.  And the reason so many people refer deals to him is that
he&apos;s proven himself to be a good guy.<br><br>Good does not mean being a pushover.  I would not want to face an
angry Ronco.  But if Ron&apos;s angry at you, it&apos;s because you did
something wrong.  Ron is so old school he&apos;s Old Testament.  He will
smite you in his just wrath, but there&apos;s no malice in it.<br><br>In almost every domain there are advantages to seeming good.  It
makes people trust you.  But actually being good is an expensive
way to seem good.  To an amoral person it might seem to be overkill.<br><br>In some fields it might be, but apparently not in the startup world.
Though plenty of investors are jerks, there is a clear trend among
them: the most successful investors are also the most upstanding. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>It was not always this way.  I would not feel confident saying that
about investors twenty years ago.<br><br>What changed?  The startup world became more transparent and more
unpredictable.  Both make it harder to seem good without actually
being good.<br><br>It&apos;s obvious why transparency has that effect.  When an investor
maltreats a founder now, it gets out.  Maybe not all the way to the
press, but other founders hear about it, and that means that investor
starts to lose deals. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The effect of unpredictability is more subtle.  It increases the
work of being inconsistent.  If you&apos;re going to be two-faced, you
have to know who you should be nice to and who you can get away
with being nasty to.  In the startup world, things change so rapidly
that you can&apos;t tell.  The random college kid you talk to today might
in a couple years be the CEO of the hottest startup in the Valley.
If you can&apos;t tell who to be nice to, you have to be nice to everyone.
And probably the only people who can manage that are the people who
are genuinely good.<br><br>In a sufficiently connected and unpredictable world, you can&apos;t seem
good without being good.<br><br>As often happens, Ron discovered how to be the investor of the
future by accident.  He didn&apos;t foresee the future of startup
investing, realize it would pay to be upstanding, and force himself
to behave that way. It would feel unnatural to him to behave any
other way.  He was already 
<a href="startupideas.html">living in the future</a>.<br><br>Fortunately that future is not limited to the startup world.  The
startup world is more transparent and unpredictable than most, but
almost everywhere the trend is in that direction.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I&apos;m not saying that if you sort investors by benevolence
you&apos;ve also sorted them by returns, but rather that if you do a
scatterplot with benevolence on the x axis and returns on the y,
you&apos;d see a clear upward trend.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]

understand startups is to look at the most successful companies and
explain why they were not as lame as they seemed when they first
launched.  Because they practically all seemed lame at first. Not
just small, lame.  Not just the first step up a big mountain.  More
like the first step into a swamp.<br><br>A Basic interpreter for the Altair?  How could that ever grow into
a giant company?  People sleeping on airbeds in strangers&apos; apartments?
A web site for college students to stalk one another?  A wimpy
little single-board computer for hobbyists that used a TV as a
monitor?  A new search engine, when there were already about 10,
and they were all trying to de-emphasize search?  These ideas didn&apos;t
just seem small.  They seemed wrong.  They were the kind of ideas
you could not merely ignore, but ridicule.<br><br>Often the founders themselves didn&apos;t know why their ideas were
promising.  They were attracted to these ideas by instinct, because
they were <a href="startupideas.html">living in the future</a> and
they sensed that something was missing.  But they could not have
put into words exactly how their ugly ducklings were going to grow
into big, beautiful swans.<br><br>Most people&apos;s first impulse when they hear about a lame-sounding
new startup idea is to make fun of it.  Even a lot of people who
should know better.<br><br>When I encounter a startup with a lame-sounding idea, I ask &quot;What
Microsoft is this the Altair Basic of?&quot;  Now it&apos;s a puzzle, and the
burden is on me to solve it.  Sometimes I can&apos;t think of an answer,
especially when the idea is a made-up one.  But it&apos;s remarkable how
often there does turn out to be an answer.  Often it&apos;s one the
founders themselves hadn&apos;t seen yet.<br><br>Intriguingly, there are sometimes multiple answers.  I talked to a
startup a few days ago that could grow into 3 distinct Microsofts.
They&apos;d probably vary in size by orders of magnitude.  But you can
never predict how big a Microsoft is going to be, so in cases like
that I encourage founders to follow whichever path is most immediately
exciting to them.  Their instincts got them this far.

should probably change your name.<br><br>The reason is not just that people can&apos;t find you.  For companies
with mobile apps, especially, having the right domain name is not
as critical as it used to be for getting users.  The problem with
not having the .com of your name is that it signals weakness.  Unless
you&apos;re so big that your reputation precedes you, a marginal domain
suggests you&apos;re a marginal company.  Whereas
(as <xa href="http://stripe.com">Stripe shows)
having x.com signals strength even if it has no relation to what you
do.<br><br>Even good founders can be in denial about this.  Their denial derives
from two very powerful forces: identity, and lack of imagination.<br><br>X is what we <i>are</i>, founders think. There&apos;s no other name as good.
Both of which are false.<br><br>You can fix the first by stepping back from the problem. Imagine
you&apos;d called your company something else.  If you had, surely you&apos;d
be just as attached to that name as you are to your current one.
The idea of switching to your current name would seem repellent.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>There&apos;s nothing intrinsically great about your current name.  Nearly
all your attachment to it comes from it being attached to you.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The way to neutralize the second source of denial, your inability
to think of other potential names, is to acknowledge that you&apos;re
bad at naming.  Naming is a completely separate skill from those
you need to be a good founder.  You can be a great startup founder
but hopeless at thinking of names for your company.<br><br>Once you acknowledge that, you stop believing there is nothing else
you could be called.  There are lots of other potential names that
are as good or better; you just can&apos;t think of them.<br><br>How do you find them? One answer is the default way to solve
problems you&apos;re bad at: find someone else who can think of names.
But with company names there is another possible
approach.  It turns out almost any word or word pair that is not
an obviously bad name is a sufficiently good one, and the number
of such domains is so large that you can find plenty that are cheap
or even untaken.  So make a list and try to buy some.  That&apos;s what
<a href="http://www.quora.com/How-did-Stripe-come-up-with-its-name?share=1">Stripe</a> 
did.  (Their search also turned up parse.com, which their
friends at Parse took.)<br><br>The reason I know that naming companies is a distinct skill orthogonal
to the others you need in a startup is that I happen to have it.
Back when I was running YC and did more office hours with startups,
I would often help them find new names.  80% of the time we could
find at least one good name in a 20 minute office hour slot.<br><br>Now when I do office hours I have to focus on more important
questions, like what the company is doing.  I tell them when they
need to change their name.  But I know the power of the forces that
have them in their grip, so I know most won&apos;t listen. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>There are of course examples of startups that have succeeded without
having the .com of their name.  There are startups that have succeeded despite any
number of different mistakes.  But this mistake is less excusable
than most.  It&apos;s something that can be fixed in a couple days if
you have sufficient discipline to acknowledge the problem.<br><br>100% of the top 20 YC companies by valuation have the .com of their
name. 94% of the top 50 do. But only 66% of companies in the current
batch have the .com of their name. Which suggests there are lessons
ahead for most of the rest, one way or another.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

The liking you have for a name that has become part of your

Sometimes founders know it&apos;s a problem that they don&apos;t have
the .com of their name, but delusion strikes a step later in the belief that they&apos;ll
be able to buy it despite having no evidence it&apos;s for sale.  Don&apos;t
believe a domain is for sale unless the owner has already told you
an asking price.<br><br>

something important: why it&apos;s safe for startup founders to be nice
people.<br><br>I grew up with a cartoon idea of a very successful businessman (in
the cartoon it was always a man): a rapacious, cigar-smoking,
table-thumping guy in his fifties who wins by exercising power, and
isn&apos;t too fussy about how.  As I&apos;ve <xa href="mean.html">written before, one of
the things that has surprised me most about startups is 
<a href="mean.html">how few</a> of
the most successful founders are like that.  Maybe successful people
in other industries are; I don&apos;t know; but not startup founders.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>I knew this empirically, but I never saw the math of why till I got
this founder&apos;s email.  In it he said he worried that he was
fundamentally soft-hearted and tended to give away too much for
free. He thought perhaps he needed &quot;a little dose of sociopath-ness.&quot;<br><br>I told him not to worry about it, because so long as he built
something good enough to spread by word of mouth, he&apos;d have a
hyperlinear growth curve.  If he was bad at extracting money from
people, at worst this curve would be some constant multiple less
than 1 of what it might have been.  But a constant multiple of any
curve is exactly the same shape.  The numbers on the Y axis are
smaller, but the curve is just as steep, and when anything grows
at the rate of a successful startup, the Y axis will take care of
itself.<br><br>Some examples will make this clear.  Suppose your company is making
$1000 a month now, and you&apos;ve made something so great that it&apos;s
growing at 5% a week.  Two years from now, you&apos;ll be making about
$160k a month.<br><br>Now suppose you&apos;re so un-rapacious that you only extract half as
much from your users as you could.  That means two years later
you&apos;ll be making $80k a month instead of $160k.  How far behind are
you? How long will it take to catch up with where you&apos;d have been
if you were extracting every penny?  A mere 15 weeks.  After two
years, the un-rapacious founder is only 3.5 months behind the
rapacious one. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you&apos;re going to optimize a number, the one to choose is your
<a href="growth.html">growth rate</a>. Suppose as before that you only extract half as much
from users as you could, but that you&apos;re able to grow 6% a week
instead of 5%.  Now how are you doing compared to the rapacious
founder after two years?  You&apos;re already ahead&#x2014;$214k a month
versus $160k&#x2014;and pulling away fast.  In another year you&apos;ll be
making $4.4 million a month to the rapacious founder&apos;s $2 million.<br><br>Obviously one case where it would help to be rapacious is when
growth depends on that.  What makes startups different is that
usually it doesn&apos;t. Startups usually win by making something so
great that people recommend it to their friends.  And being rapacious
not only doesn&apos;t help you do that, but probably hurts.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The reason startup founders can safely be nice is that making great
things is compounded, and rapacity isn&apos;t.<br><br>So if you&apos;re a founder, here&apos;s a deal you can make with yourself
that will both make you happy and make your company successful.
Tell yourself you can be as nice as you want, so long as you work
hard on your growth rate to compensate.  Most successful startups
make that tradeoff unconsciously. Maybe if you do it consciously
you&apos;ll do it even better.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Many think successful startup founders are driven by money.
In fact the secret weapon of the most successful founders is that
they aren&apos;t.  If they were, they&apos;d have taken one of the acquisition
offers that every fast-growing startup gets on the way up.  What
drives the most successful founders is the same thing that drives
most people who make things: the company is their project.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In fact since 2 &#x2248; 1.05 ^ 15, the un-rapacious founder is
always 15 weeks behind the rapacious one.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The other reason it might help to be good at squeezing money
out of customers is that startups usually lose money at first, and
making more per customer makes it easier to get to profitability
before your initial funding runs out.  But while it is very common
for startups to <a href="pinch.html">die</a>
from running through their initial funding and then being unable
to raise more, the underlying cause is usually slow growth or
excessive spending rather than insufficient effort to extract money
from existing customers.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Harj Taggar, Jessica Livingston, and

9 months, the first thing I want to know is almost always the same.
Assuming their expenses remain constant and their revenue growth
is what it&apos;s been over the last several months, do they make it to
profitability on the money they have left?  Or to put it more
dramatically, by default do they live or die?<br><br>The startling thing is how often the founders themselves don&apos;t know.
Half the founders I talk to don&apos;t know whether they&apos;re default alive
or default dead.<br><br>If you&apos;re among that number, Trevor Blackwell has made a handy
<a href="http://growth.tlb.org/#"><u>calculator</u></a> you can use to find out.<br><br>The reason I want to know first whether a startup is default alive
or default dead is that the rest of the conversation depends on the
answer.  If the company is default alive, we can talk about ambitious
new things they could do.  If it&apos;s default dead, we probably need
to talk about how to save it.  We know the current trajectory ends
badly.  How can they get off that trajectory?<br><br>Why do so few founders know whether they&apos;re default alive or default
dead?  Mainly, I think, because they&apos;re not used to asking that.
It&apos;s not a question that makes sense to ask early on, any more than
it makes sense to ask a 3 year old how he plans to support
himself.  But as the company grows older the question switches from
meaningless to critical.  That kind of switch often takes people
by surprise.<br><br>I propose the following solution: instead of starting to ask too
late whether you&apos;re default alive or default dead, start asking too
early.  It&apos;s hard to say precisely when the question switches
polarity.  But it&apos;s probably not that dangerous to start worrying
too early that you&apos;re default dead, whereas it&apos;s very dangerous to
start worrying too late.<br><br>The reason is a phenomenon I wrote about earlier: the
<a href="pinch.html">fatal pinch</a>.
The fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enough
time to fix it.  And the way founders end up in it is by not realizing
that&apos;s where they&apos;re headed.<br><br>There is another reason founders don&apos;t ask themselves whether they&apos;re
default alive or default dead: they assume it will be easy to raise
more money.  But that assumption is often false, and worse still, the
more you depend on it, the falser it becomes.<br><br>Maybe it will help to separate facts from hopes. Instead of thinking
of the future with vague optimism, explicitly separate the components.
Say &quot;We&apos;re default dead, but we&apos;re counting on investors to save
us.&quot; Maybe as you say that it will set off the same alarms in your
head that it does in mine.  And if you set off the alarms sufficiently
early, you may be able to avoid the fatal pinch.<br><br>It would be safe to be default dead if you could count on investors
saving you.  As a rule their interest is a function of
growth.  If you have steep revenue growth, say over 6x a year, you
can start to count on investors being interested even if you&apos;re not
profitable.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
But investors are so fickle that you can never
do more than start to count on it.  Sometimes something about your
business will spook investors even if your growth is great.  So no
matter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising
as more than a plan A. You should always have a plan B as well: you
should know (as in write down) precisely what you&apos;ll need to do to
survive if you can&apos;t raise more money, and precisely when you&apos;ll 
have to switch to plan B if plan A isn&apos;t working.<br><br>In any case, growing fast versus operating cheaply is far from the
sharp dichotomy many founders assume it to be.  In practice there
is surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spends
and how fast it grows.  When a startup grows fast, it&apos;s usually
because the product hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some big
need straight on.  When a startup spends a lot, it&apos;s usually because
the product is expensive to develop or sell, or simply because
they&apos;re wasteful.<br><br>If you&apos;re paying attention, you&apos;ll be asking at this point not just
how to avoid the fatal pinch, but how to avoid being default dead.
That one is easy: don&apos;t hire too fast.  Hiring too fast is by far
the biggest killer of startups that raise money.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Founders tell themselves they need to hire in order to grow.  But
most err on the side of overestimating this need rather than
underestimating it.  Why?  Partly because there&apos;s so much work to
be done.  Naive founders think that if they can just hire enough
people, it somehow will be.  Partly because successful startups have
lots of employees, so it seems like that&apos;s what one does in order
to be successful.  In fact the large staffs of successful startups
are probably more the effect of growth than the cause.  And
partly because when founders have slow growth they don&apos;t want to
face what is usually the real reason: the product is not appealing
enough.<br><br>Plus founders who&apos;ve just raised money are often encouraged to
overhire by the VCs who funded them.  Kill-or-cure strategies are
optimal for VCs because they&apos;re protected by the portfolio effect.
VCs want to blow you up, in one sense of the phrase or the other.
But as a founder your incentives are different.  You want above all
to survive.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Here&apos;s a common way startups die.  They make something moderately
appealing and have decent initial growth. They raise their first
round fairly easily because the founders seem smart and the idea
sounds plausible. But because the product is only moderately
appealing, growth is ok but not great.  The founders convince
themselves that hiring a bunch of people is the way to boost growth.
Their investors agree.  But (because the product is only moderately
appealing) the growth never comes.  Now they&apos;re rapidly running out
of runway.  They hope further investment will save them. But because
they have high expenses and slow growth, they&apos;re now unappealing
to investors. They&apos;re unable to raise more, and the company dies.<br><br>What the company should have done is address the fundamental problem:
that the product is only moderately appealing.  Hiring people is
rarely the way to fix that.  More often than not it makes it harder.
At this early stage, the product needs to evolve more than to be
&quot;built out,&quot; and that&apos;s usually easier with fewer people.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Asking whether you&apos;re default alive or default dead may save you
from this.  Maybe the alarm bells it sets off will counteract the
forces that push you to overhire.  Instead you&apos;ll be compelled to
seek growth in other ways. For example, by <a href="ds.html"><u>doing
things that don&apos;t scale</u></a>, or by redesigning the product in the
way only founders can.
And for many if not most startups, these paths to growth will be
the ones that actually work.<br><br>Airbnb waited 4 months after raising money at the end of Y&#xA0;Combinator
before they hired their first employee.  In the meantime the founders
were terribly overworked.  But they were overworked evolving Airbnb
into the astonishingly successful organism it is now.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Steep usage growth will also interest investors.  Revenue
will ultimately be a constant multiple of usage, so x% usage growth
predicts x% revenue growth.  But in practice investors discount
merely predicted revenue, so if you&apos;re measuring usage you need a
higher growth rate to impress investors.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Startups that don&apos;t raise money are saved from hiring too
fast because they can&apos;t afford to. But that doesn&apos;t mean you should
avoid raising money in order to avoid this problem, any more than
that total abstinence is the only way to avoid becoming an alcoholic.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
I would not be surprised if VCs&apos; tendency to push founders
to overhire is not even in their own interest.  They don&apos;t know how
many of the companies that get killed by overspending might have
done well if they&apos;d survived.  My guess is a significant number.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
After reading a draft, Sam Altman wrote:<br><br>&quot;I think you should make the hiring point more strongly.  I think
it&apos;s roughly correct to say that YC&apos;s most successful companies
have never been the fastest to hire, and one of the marks of a great

take a small business that isn&apos;t really working (bad unit economics,

write: write in spoken language.<br><br>Something comes over most people when they start writing. They write
in a different language than they&apos;d use if they were talking to a
friend. The sentence structure and even the words are different.
No one uses &quot;pen&quot; as a verb in spoken English. You&apos;d feel like an
idiot using &quot;pen&quot; instead of &quot;write&quot; in a conversation with a friend.<br><br>The last straw for me was a sentence I read a couple days ago:
<blockquote>
  The mercurial Spaniard himself declared: &quot;After Altamira, all is
  decadence.&quot;
</blockquote>
It&apos;s from Neil Oliver&apos;s <i>A History of Ancient Britain</i>. I feel bad
making an example of this book, because it&apos;s no worse than lots of
others.  But just imagine calling Picasso &quot;the mercurial Spaniard&quot; when
talking to a friend.  Even one
sentence of this would raise eyebrows in conversation.  And yet
people write whole books of it.<br><br>Ok, so written and spoken language are different. Does that make
written language worse?<br><br>If you want people to read and understand what you write, yes.
Written language is more complex, which makes it more work to read.
It&apos;s also more formal and distant, which gives the reader&apos;s attention
permission to drift.  But perhaps worst of all, the complex sentences
and fancy words give you, the writer, the false impression that
you&apos;re saying more than you actually are.<br><br>You don&apos;t need complex sentences to express complex ideas.  When
specialists in some abstruse topic talk to one another about ideas
in their field, they don&apos;t use sentences any more complex than they
do when talking about what to have for lunch.  They use different
words, certainly.  But even those they use no more than necessary.
And in my experience, the harder the subject, the more informally
experts speak. Partly, I think, because they have less to prove,
and partly because the harder the ideas you&apos;re talking about, the
less you can afford to let language get in the way.<br><br>Informal language is the athletic clothing of ideas.<br><br>I&apos;m not saying spoken language always works best. Poetry is as much
music as text, so you can say things you wouldn&apos;t say in conversation.
And there are a handful of writers who can get away with using fancy
language in prose. And then of course there are cases where writers
don&apos;t want to make it easy to understand what they&apos;re saying&#x2014;in
corporate announcements of bad news, for example, or at the more
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=1,5&amp;q=transgression+narrative+postmodern+gender"><u>bogus</u></a> end of the humanities.  But for nearly everyone else, spoken
language is better.<br><br>It seems to be hard for most people to write in spoken language.
So perhaps the best solution is to write your first draft the way
you usually would, then afterward look at each sentence and ask &quot;Is
this the way I&apos;d say this if I were talking to a friend?&quot; If it
isn&apos;t, imagine what you would say, and use that instead.  After a
while this filter will start to operate as you write. When you write
something you wouldn&apos;t say, you&apos;ll hear the clank as it hits the
page.<br><br>Before I publish a new essay, I read it out loud and fix everything
that doesn&apos;t sound like conversation. I even fix bits that are
phonetically awkward; I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s necessary, but it
doesn&apos;t cost much.<br><br>This trick may not always be enough.  I&apos;ve seen writing so far
removed from spoken language that it couldn&apos;t be fixed sentence by
sentence.  For cases like that there&apos;s a more drastic solution.
After writing the first draft, try explaining to a friend what you
just wrote. Then replace the draft with what you said to your friend.<br><br>People often tell me how much my essays sound like me talking.
The fact that this seems worthy of comment shows how rarely people
manage to write in spoken language.  Otherwise everyone&apos;s writing
would sound like them talking.<br><br>If you simply manage to write in spoken language, you&apos;ll be ahead
of 95% of writers.  And it&apos;s so easy to do: just don&apos;t let a sentence
through unless it&apos;s the way you&apos;d say it to a friend.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

it&apos;s possible to detect bias in a selection process without knowing
anything about the applicant pool.  Which is exciting because among
other things it means third parties can use this technique to detect
bias whether those doing the selecting want them to or not.<br><br>You can use this technique whenever (a) you have at least
a random sample of the applicants that were selected, (b) their
subsequent performance is measured, and (c) the groups of

it means for a selection process to be biased against applicants

Which means applicants of type x
who do make it through the selection process will outperform other
successful applicants.  And if the performance of all the successful
applicants is measured, you&apos;ll know if they do.<br><br>Of course, the test you use to measure performance must be a valid
one.  And in particular it must not be invalidated by the bias you&apos;re
trying to measure.
But there are some domains where performance can be measured, and
in those detecting bias is straightforward. Want to know if the
selection process was biased against some type of applicant?  Check
whether they outperform the others.  This is not just a heuristic
for detecting bias.  It&apos;s what bias means.<br><br>For example, many suspect that venture capital firms are biased
against female founders. This would be easy to detect: among their
portfolio companies, do startups with female founders outperform
those without?  A couple months ago, one VC firm (almost certainly
unintentionally) published a study showing bias of this type. First
Round Capital found that among its portfolio companies, startups
with female founders <a href="http://10years.firstround.com/#one"><u>outperformed</u></a>
those without by 63%. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The reason I began by saying that this technique would come as a
surprise to many people is that we so rarely see analyses of this
type.  I&apos;m sure it will come as a surprise to First Round that they
performed one. I doubt anyone there realized that by limiting their
sample to their own portfolio, they were producing a study not of
startup trends but of their own biases when selecting companies.
If they&apos;d understood the implications of the numbers they were
publishing, they wouldn&apos;t have presented them the way they did.<br><br>I predict we&apos;ll see this technique used more in the future.  The
information needed to conduct such studies is increasingly available.
Data about who applies for things is usually closely guarded by the
organizations selecting them, but nowadays data about who gets
selected is often publicly available to anyone who takes the trouble
to aggregate it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This technique wouldn&apos;t work if the selection process looked
for different things from different types of applicants&#x2014;for
example, if an employer hired men based on their ability but women
based on their appearance.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
As Paul Buchheit points out, First Round excluded their most 
successful investment, Uber, from the study.  And while it 
makes sense to exclude outliers from some types of studies, 
studies of returns from startup investing, which is all about 
hitting outliers, are not one of them.<br><br>

it had been a &quot;one-man show.&quot;  It&apos;s sadly common to read that sort
of thing.  But the problem with that description is not just that
it&apos;s unfair.  It&apos;s also misleading.  Much of what&apos;s most novel about
YC is due to Jessica Livingston.  If you don&apos;t understand her, you
don&apos;t understand YC.  So let me tell you a little about Jessica.<br><br>YC had 4 founders.  Jessica and I decided one night to start it,
and the next day we recruited my friends Robert Morris and Trevor
Blackwell.  Jessica and I ran YC day to day, and Robert and Trevor
read applications and did interviews with us.<br><br>Jessica and I were already dating when we started YC.  At first we
tried to act &quot;professional&quot; about this, meaning we tried to conceal
it.  In retrospect that seems ridiculous, and we soon dropped the
pretense.  And the fact that Jessica and I were a couple is a big
part of what made YC what it was.  YC felt like a family.  The
founders early on were mostly young.  We all had dinner together
once a week, cooked for the first couple years by me. Our first
building had been a private home.  The overall atmosphere was
shockingly different from a VC&apos;s office on Sand Hill Road, in a way
that was entirely for the better.  There was an authenticity that
everyone who walked in could sense.  And that didn&apos;t just mean that
people trusted us.  It was the perfect quality to instill in startups.
Authenticity is one of the most important things YC looks for in
founders, not just because fakers and opportunists are annoying,
but because authenticity is one of the main things that separates
the most successful startups from the rest.<br><br>Early YC was a family, and Jessica was its mom.  And the culture
she defined was one of YC&apos;s most important innovations.  Culture
is important in any organization, but at YC culture wasn&apos;t just how
we behaved when we built the product. At YC, the culture was the
product.<br><br>Jessica was also the mom in another sense: she had the last word.
Everything we did as an organization went through her <nobr>first&#x2014;who</nobr>
to fund, what to say to the public, how to deal with other companies,
who to hire, everything.<br><br>Before we had kids, YC was more or less our life. There was no real
distinction between working hours and not.  We talked about YC all
the time.  And while there might be some businesses that it would
be tedious to let infect your private life, we liked it. We&apos;d started
YC because it was something we were interested in.  And some of the
problems we were trying to solve were endlessly difficult.  How do
you recognize good founders?  You could talk about that for years,
and we did; we still do.<br><br>I&apos;m better at some things than Jessica, and she&apos;s better at some
things than me.  One of the things she&apos;s best at is judging people.
She&apos;s one of those rare individuals with x-ray vision for character.
She can see through any kind of faker almost immediately.  Her
nickname within YC was the Social Radar, and this special power of
hers was critical in making YC what it is.  The earlier you pick
startups, the more you&apos;re picking the founders.  Later stage investors
get to try products and look at growth numbers.  At the stage where
YC invests, there is often neither a product nor any numbers.<br><br>Others thought YC had some special insight about the future of
technology.  Mostly we had the same sort of insight Socrates claimed:
we at least knew we knew nothing.  What made YC successful was being
able to pick good founders.  We thought Airbnb was a bad idea.  We
funded it because we liked the founders.<br><br>During interviews, Robert and Trevor and I would pepper the applicants
with technical questions.  Jessica would mostly watch.  A lot of
the applicants probably read her as some kind of secretary, especially
early on, because she was the one who&apos;d go out and get each new
group and she didn&apos;t ask many questions. She was ok with that.  It
was easier for her to watch people if they didn&apos;t notice her. But
after the interview, the three of us would turn to Jessica and ask
&quot;What does the Social Radar say?&quot;
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Having the Social Radar at interviews wasn&apos;t just how we picked
founders who&apos;d be successful.  It was also how we picked founders
who were good people.  At first we did this because we couldn&apos;t
help it.  Imagine what it would feel like to have x-ray vision for
character.  Being around bad people would be intolerable.  So we&apos;d
refuse to fund founders whose characters we had doubts about even
if we thought they&apos;d be successful.<br><br>Though we initially did this out of self-indulgence, it turned out
to be very valuable to YC.  We didn&apos;t realize it in the beginning,
but the people we were picking would become the YC alumni network.
And once we picked them, unless they did something really egregious,
they were going to be part of it for life. Some now think YC&apos;s
alumni network is its most valuable feature. I personally think
YC&apos;s advice is pretty good too, but the alumni network is certainly
among the most valuable features.  The level of trust and helpfulness
is remarkable for a group of such size.  And Jessica is the main
reason why.<br><br>(As we later learned, it probably cost us little to reject people
whose characters we had doubts about, because how good founders are
and how well they do are <a href="mean.html"><u>not orthogonal</u></a>.  If bad founders succeed
at all, they tend to sell early.  The most successful founders are
almost all good.)<br><br>If Jessica was so important to YC, why don&apos;t more people realize
it?  Partly because I&apos;m a writer, and writers always get disproportionate
attention.  YC&apos;s brand was initially my brand, and our applicants
were people who&apos;d read my essays.  But there is another reason:
Jessica hates attention.  Talking to reporters makes her nervous.
The thought of giving a talk paralyzes her.  She was even uncomfortable
at our wedding, because the bride is always the center of attention.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>It&apos;s not just because she&apos;s shy that she hates attention, but because
it throws off the Social Radar. She can&apos;t be herself. You can&apos;t
watch people when everyone is watching you.<br><br>Another reason attention worries her is that she hates bragging.
In anything she does that&apos;s publicly visible, her biggest fear
(after the obvious fear that it will be bad) is that it will seem
ostentatious.  She says being too modest is a common problem for
women.  But in her case it goes beyond that.  She has a horror of
ostentation so visceral it&apos;s almost a phobia.<br><br>She also hates fighting. She can&apos;t do it; she just shuts down.  And
unfortunately there is a good deal of fighting in being the public
face of an organization.<br><br>So although Jessica more than anyone made YC unique, the very
qualities that enabled her to do it mean she tends to get written
out of YC&apos;s history.  Everyone buys this story that PG started YC
and his wife just kind of helped.  Even YC&apos;s haters buy it.  A
couple years ago when people were attacking us for not funding more
female founders (than exist), they all treated YC as identical with
PG.  It would have spoiled the narrative to acknowledge Jessica&apos;s
central role at YC.<br><br>Jessica was boiling mad that people were accusing <i>her</i> company of
sexism. I&apos;ve never seen her angrier about anything.  But she did
not contradict them.  Not publicly.  In private there was a great
deal of profanity.  And she wrote three separate essays about the
question of female founders.  But she could never bring herself to
publish any of them.  She&apos;d seen the level of vitriol in this debate,
and she shrank from engaging.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>It wasn&apos;t just because she disliked fighting.  She&apos;s so sensitive
to character that it repels her even to fight with dishonest people.
The idea of mixing it up with linkbait journalists or Twitter trolls
would seem to her not merely frightening, but disgusting.<br><br>But Jessica knew her example as a successful female founder would
encourage more women to start companies, so last year she did
something YC had never done before and hired a PR firm to get her
some interviews.  At one of the first she did, the reporter brushed
aside her insights about startups and turned it into a sensationalistic
story about how some guy had tried to chat her up as she was waiting
outside the bar where they had arranged to meet.  Jessica was
mortified, partly because the guy had done nothing wrong, but more
because the story treated her as a victim significant only for being
a woman, rather than one of the most knowledgeable investors in the
Valley.<br><br>After that she told the PR firm to stop.<br><br>You&apos;re not going to be hearing in the press about what Jessica has
achieved. So let me tell you what Jessica has achieved.  <nobr>Y Combinator</nobr>
is fundamentally a nexus of people, like a university. It doesn&apos;t
make a product. What defines it is the people.  Jessica more than
anyone curated and nurtured that collection of people.  In that
sense she literally made YC.<br><br>Jessica knows more about the qualities of startup founders than
anyone else ever has. Her immense data set and x-ray vision are the
perfect storm in that respect.  The qualities of the founders are
the best predictor of how a startup will do.  And startups are in
turn the most important source of growth in mature economies.<br><br>The person who knows the most about the most important factor in
the growth of mature economies&#x2014;that is who Jessica Livingston is.
Doesn&apos;t that sound like someone who should be better known?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Harj Taggar reminded me that while Jessica didn&apos;t ask many
questions, they tended to be important ones:<br><br>&quot;She was always good at sniffing out any red flags about the team
or their determination and disarmingly asking the right question,
which usually revealed more than the founders realized.&quot;<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Or more precisely, while she likes getting attention in the
sense of getting credit for what she has done, she doesn&apos;t like
getting attention in the sense of being watched in real time.
Unfortunately, not just for her but for a lot of people, how much
you get of the former depends a lot on how much you get of the
latter.<br><br>Incidentally, if you saw Jessica at a public event, you would never
guess she
hates attention, because (a) she is very polite and (b) when she&apos;s
nervous, she expresses it by smiling more.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The existence of people like Jessica is not just something
the mainstream media needs to learn to acknowledge, but something
feminists need to learn to acknowledge as well.  There are successful
women who don&apos;t like to fight.  Which means if the public conversation
about women consists of fighting, their voices will be silenced.<br><br>There&apos;s a sort of Gresham&apos;s Law of conversations. If a conversation
reaches a certain level of incivility, the more thoughtful people
start to leave. No one understands female founders better than
Jessica.  But it&apos;s unlikely anyone will ever hear her speak candidly
about the topic. She ventured a toe in that water a while ago, and
the reaction was so violent that she decided &quot;never again.&quot;<br><br>

your lifetime.  A lot of the change I&apos;ve seen is fragmentation.  US
politics is much more polarized than it used to be.  Culturally we
have ever less common ground. The creative class flocks to a handful
of happy cities, abandoning the rest.  And increasing economic
inequality means the spread between rich and poor is growing too.
I&apos;d like to propose a hypothesis: that all these trends are instances
of the same phenomenon.  And moreover, that the cause is not some
force that&apos;s pulling us apart, but rather the erosion of forces
that had been pushing us together.<br><br>Worse still, for those who worry about these trends, the forces
that were pushing us together were an anomaly, a one-time combination
of circumstances that&apos;s unlikely to be repeated&#x2014;and indeed, that
we would not want to repeat.<br><br>The two forces were war (above all World War II), and the rise of
large corporations.<br><br>The effects of World War II were both economic and social.
Economically, it decreased variation in income.  Like all modern
armed forces, America&apos;s were socialist economically.  From each
according to his ability, to each according to his need.  More or
less.  Higher ranking members of the military got more (as higher
ranking members of socialist societies always do), but what they
got was fixed according to their rank.  And the flattening effect
wasn&apos;t limited to those under arms, because the US economy was
conscripted too.  Between 1942 and 1945 all wages were set by the
National War Labor Board. Like the military, they defaulted to
flatness.  And this national standardization of wages was so pervasive
that its effects could still be seen years after the war ended.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Business owners weren&apos;t supposed to be making money either.  FDR
said &quot;not a single war millionaire&quot; would be permitted.  To ensure
that, any increase in a company&apos;s profits over prewar levels was
taxed at 85%.  And when what was left after corporate taxes reached
individuals, it was taxed again at a marginal rate of 93%.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Socially too the war tended to decrease variation.  Over 16 million
men and women from all sorts of different backgrounds were brought
together in a way of life that was literally uniform.  Service rates
for men born in the early 1920s approached 80%. And working toward
a common goal, often under stress, brought them still closer together.<br><br>Though strictly speaking World War II lasted less than 4 years for
the US, its effects lasted longer.  Wars make central governments
more powerful, and World War II was an extreme case of this.  In
the US, as in all the other Allied countries, the federal government
was slow to give up the new powers it had acquired.  Indeed, in
some respects the war didn&apos;t end in 1945; the enemy just switched
to the Soviet Union.  In tax rates, federal power, defense spending,
conscription, and nationalism the decades after the war looked more
like wartime than prewar peacetime.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
And the social effects
lasted too.  The kid pulled into the army from behind a mule team
in West Virginia didn&apos;t simply go back to the farm afterward.
Something else was waiting for him, something that looked a lot
like the army.<br><br>If total war was the big political story of the 20th century, the
big economic story was the rise of a new kind of company.  And this
too tended to produce both social and economic cohesion.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>The 20th century was the century of the big, national corporation.
General Electric, General Foods, General Motors.  Developments in
finance, communications, transportation, and manufacturing enabled
a new type of company whose goal was above all scale.  Version 1
of this world was low-res: a Duplo world of a few giant companies
dominating each big market.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>The late 19th and early 20th centuries had been a time of consolidation,
led especially by J. P. Morgan.  Thousands of companies run by their
founders were merged into a couple hundred giant ones run by
professional managers. Economies of scale ruled the day.  It seemed
to people at the time that this was the final state of things.  John
D. Rockefeller said in 1880
<blockquote>
  The day of combination is here to stay. Individualism has gone,
  never to return.
</blockquote>
He turned out to be mistaken, but he seemed right for the next
hundred years.<br><br>The consolidation that began in the late 19th century continued for
most of the 20th.  By the end of World War II, as Michael Lind
writes, &quot;the major sectors of the economy were either organized
as government-backed cartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic
corporations.&quot;<br><br>For consumers this new world meant the same choices everywhere, but
only a few of them.  When I grew up there were only 2 or 3 of most
things, and since they were all aiming at the middle of the market
there wasn&apos;t much to differentiate them.<br><br>One of the most important instances of this phenomenon was in TV.
Here there were 3 choices: NBC, CBS, and ABC. Plus public TV for
eggheads and communists.  The programs the 3 networks offered were
indistinguishable.  In fact, here there was a triple pressure toward
the center. If one show did try something daring, local affiliates
in conservative markets would make them stop. Plus since TVs were
expensive whole families watched the same shows together, so they
had to be suitable for everyone.<br><br>And not only did everyone get the same thing, they got it at the
same time.  It&apos;s difficult to imagine now, but every night tens of
millions of families would sit down together in front of their TV
set watching the same show, at the same time, as their next door
neighbors.  What happens now with the Super Bowl used to happen
every night. We were literally in sync.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>In a way mid-century TV culture was good. The view it gave of the
world was like you&apos;d find in a children&apos;s book, and it probably had
something of the effect that (parents hope) children&apos;s books have
in making people behave better.  But, like children&apos;s books, TV was
also misleading.  Dangerously misleading, for adults. In his
autobiography, Robert MacNeil talks of seeing gruesome images that
had just come in from Vietnam and thinking, we can&apos;t show these to
families while they&apos;re having dinner.<br><br>I know how pervasive the common culture was, because I tried to opt
out of it, and it was practically impossible to find alternatives.
When I was 13 I realized, more from internal evidence than any
outside source, that the ideas we were being fed on TV were crap,
and I stopped watching it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
But it wasn&apos;t just TV.  It seemed
like everything around me was crap.  The politicians all saying the
same things, the consumer brands making almost identical products
with different labels stuck on to indicate how prestigious they
were meant to be, the balloon-frame houses with fake &quot;colonial&quot;
skins, the cars with several feet of gratuitous metal on each end
that started to fall apart after a couple years, the &quot;red delicious&quot;
apples that were red but only <xa href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/the-evil-reign-of-the-red-delicious/379892/">nominally 
apples. And in retrospect, it <i>was</i> crap.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>But when I went looking for alternatives to fill this void, I found
practically nothing.  There was no Internet then.  The only place
to look was in the chain bookstore in our local shopping mall. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font>
There I found a copy of <i>The Atlantic</i>.  I wish I could say it became
a gateway into a wider world, but in fact I found it boring and
incomprehensible.  Like a kid tasting whisky for the first time and
pretending to like it, I preserved that magazine as carefully as
if it had been a book. I&apos;m sure I still have it somewhere.  But
though it was evidence that there was, somewhere, a world that
wasn&apos;t red delicious, I didn&apos;t find it till college.<br><br>It wasn&apos;t just as consumers that the big companies made us similar.
They did as employers too.  Within companies there were powerful
forces pushing people toward a single model of how to look and act.
IBM was particularly notorious for this, but they were only a little
more extreme than other big companies.  And the models of how to
look and act varied little between companies. Meaning everyone
within this world was expected to seem more or less the same.  And
not just those in the corporate world, but also everyone who aspired
to it&#x2014;which in the middle of the 20th century meant most people
who weren&apos;t already in it.  For most of the 20th century, working-class
people tried hard to look middle class.  You can see it in old
photos.  Few adults aspired to look dangerous in 1950.<br><br>But the rise of national corporations didn&apos;t just compress us
culturally.  It compressed us economically too, and on both ends.<br><br>Along with giant national corporations, we got giant national labor
unions.  And in the mid 20th century the corporations cut deals
with the unions where they paid over market price for labor.  Partly
because the unions were monopolies. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font>
Partly because, as
components of oligopolies themselves, the corporations knew they
could safely pass the cost on to their customers, because their
competitors would have to as well.  And partly because in mid-century
most of the giant companies were still focused on finding new ways
to milk economies of scale.  Just as startups rightly pay AWS a
premium over the cost of running their own servers so they can focus
on growth, many of the big national corporations were willing to
pay a premium for labor. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>As well as pushing incomes up from the bottom, by overpaying unions,
the big companies of the 20th century also pushed incomes down at
the top, by underpaying their top management. Economist J. K.
Galbraith wrote in 1967 that &quot;There are few corporations in which
it would be suggested that executive salaries are at a maximum.&quot;
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>To some extent this was an illusion.  Much of the de facto pay of
executives never showed up on their income tax returns, because it
took the form of perks.  The higher the rate of income tax, the
more pressure there was to pay employees upstream of it.  (In the
UK, where taxes were even higher than in the US, companies would
even pay their kids&apos; private school tuitions.)  One of the most
valuable things the big companies of the mid 20th century gave their
employees was job security, and this too didn&apos;t show up in tax
returns or income statistics. So the nature of employment in these
organizations tended to yield falsely low numbers about economic
inequality.  But even accounting for that, the big companies paid
their best people less than market price.  There was no market; the
expectation was that you&apos;d work for the same company for decades
if not your whole career. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>Your work was so illiquid there was little chance of getting market
price. But that same illiquidity also encouraged you not to seek
it.  If the company promised to employ you till you retired and
give you a pension afterward, you didn&apos;t want to extract as much
from it this year as you could. You needed to take care of the
company so it could take care of you.  Especially when you&apos;d been
working with the same group of people for decades.  If you tried
to squeeze the company for more money, you were squeezing the
organization that was going to take care of <i>them</i>.  Plus if
you didn&apos;t put the company first you wouldn&apos;t be promoted, and if
you couldn&apos;t switch ladders, promotion on this one was the only way
up. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#999999">14</font></a>]</font><br><br>To someone who&apos;d spent several formative years in the armed forces,
this situation didn&apos;t seem as strange as it does to us now.  From
their point of view, as big company executives, they were high-ranking
officers.  They got paid a lot more than privates.  They got to
have expense account lunches at the best restaurants and fly around
on the company&apos;s Gulfstreams.  It probably didn&apos;t occur to most of
them to ask if they were being paid market price.<br><br>The ultimate way to get market price is to work for yourself, by
starting your own company.  That seems obvious to any ambitious
person now.  But in the mid 20th century it was an alien concept.
Not because starting one&apos;s own company seemed too ambitious, but
because it didn&apos;t seem ambitious enough. Even as late as the 1970s,
when I grew up, the ambitious plan was to get lots of education at
prestigious institutions, and then join some other prestigious
institution and work one&apos;s way up the hierarchy.  Your prestige was
the prestige of the institution you belonged to.  People did start
their own businesses of course, but educated people rarely did,
because in those days there was practically zero concept of starting
what we now call a <a href="growth.html"><u>startup</u></a>: 
a business that starts small and grows
big.  That was much harder to do in the mid 20th century.  Starting
one&apos;s own business meant starting a business that would start small
and stay small. Which in those days of big companies often meant
scurrying around trying to avoid being trampled by elephants.  It
was more prestigious to be one of the executive class riding the
elephant.<br><br>By the 1970s, no one stopped to wonder where the big prestigious
companies had come from in the first place.  It seemed like they&apos;d
always been there, like the chemical elements.  And indeed, there
was a double wall between ambitious kids in the 20th century and
the origins of the big companies.  Many of the big companies were
roll-ups that didn&apos;t have clear founders.  And when they did, the
founders didn&apos;t seem like us.  Nearly all of them had been uneducated,
in the sense of not having been to college.  They were what Shakespeare
called rude mechanicals.  College trained one to be a member of the
professional classes.  Its graduates didn&apos;t expect to do the sort
of grubby menial work that Andrew Carnegie or Henry Ford started
out doing. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#999999">15</font></a>]</font><br><br>And in the 20th century there were more and more college graduates.
They increased from about 2% of the population in 1900 to about 25%
in 2000. In the middle of the century our two big forces intersect,
in the form of the GI Bill, which sent 2.2 million World War II
veterans to college.  Few thought of it in these terms, but the
result of making college the canonical path for the ambitious was
a world in which it was socially acceptable to work for Henry Ford,
but not to be Henry Ford.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#999999">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>I remember this world well. I came of age just as it was starting
to break up. In my childhood it was still dominant. Not quite so
dominant as it had been.  We could see from old TV shows and yearbooks
and the way adults acted that people in the 1950s and 60s had been
even more conformist than us.  The mid-century model was already
starting to get old. But that was not how we saw it at the time.
We would at most have said that one could be a bit more daring in
1975 than 1965.  And indeed, things hadn&apos;t changed much yet.<br><br>But change was coming soon. And when the Duplo economy started to
disintegrate, it disintegrated in several different ways at once.
Vertically integrated companies literally dis-integrated because
it was more efficient to.  Incumbents faced new competitors as (a)
markets went global and (b) technical innovation started to trump
economies of scale, turning size from an asset into a liability.
Smaller companies were increasingly able to survive as formerly
narrow channels to consumers broadened.  Markets themselves started
to change faster, as whole new categories of products appeared. And
last but not least, the federal government, which had previously
smiled upon J. P. Morgan&apos;s world as the natural state of things,
began to realize it wasn&apos;t the last word after all.<br><br>What J. P. Morgan was to the horizontal axis, Henry Ford was to the
vertical.  He wanted to do everything himself. The giant plant he
built at River Rouge between 1917 and 1928 literally took in iron
ore at one end and sent cars out the other.  100,000 people worked
there. At the time it seemed the future. But that is not how car
companies operate today.  Now much of the design and manufacturing
happens in a long supply chain, whose products the car companies
ultimately assemble and sell.  The reason car companies operate
this way is that it works better.  Each company in the supply chain
focuses on what they know best. And they each have to do it well
or they can be swapped out for another supplier.<br><br>Why didn&apos;t Henry Ford realize that networks of cooperating companies
work better than a single big company? One reason is that supplier
networks take a while to evolve. In 1917, doing everything himself
seemed to Ford the only way to get the scale he needed. And the
second reason is that if you want to solve a problem using a network
of cooperating companies, you have to be able to coordinate their
efforts, and you can do that much better with computers.  Computers
reduce the transaction costs that Coase argued are the raison d&apos;etre
of corporations. That is a fundamental change.<br><br>In the early 20th century, big companies were synonymous with
efficiency.  In the late 20th century they were synonymous with
inefficiency.  To some extent this was because the companies
themselves had become sclerotic.  But it was also because our
standards were higher.<br><br>It wasn&apos;t just within existing industries that change occurred.
The industries themselves changed.  It became possible to make lots
of new things, and sometimes the existing companies weren&apos;t the
ones who did it best.<br><br>Microcomputers are a classic example. The market was pioneered by
upstarts like Apple. When it got big enough, IBM decided it was
worth paying attention to.  At the time IBM completely dominated
the computer industry. They assumed that all they had to do, now
that this market was ripe, was to reach out and pick it.  Most
people at the time would have agreed with them.  But what happened
next illustrated how much more complicated the world had become.
IBM did launch a microcomputer.  Though quite successful, it did
not crush Apple.  But even more importantly, IBM itself ended up
being supplanted by a supplier coming in from the side&#x2014;from
software, which didn&apos;t even seem to be the same business.  IBM&apos;s
big mistake was to accept a non-exclusive license for DOS.  It must
have seemed a safe move at the time.  No other computer manufacturer
had ever been able to outsell them. What difference did it make if
other manufacturers could offer DOS too?  The result of that
miscalculation was an explosion of inexpensive PC clones.  Microsoft
now owned the PC standard, and the customer.  And the microcomputer
business ended up being Apple vs Microsoft.<br><br>Basically, Apple bumped IBM and then Microsoft stole its wallet.
That sort of thing did not happen to big companies in mid-century.
But it was going to happen increasingly often in the future.<br><br>Change happened mostly by itself in the computer business.  In other
industries, legal obstacles had to be removed first.  Many of the
mid-century oligopolies had been anointed by the federal government
with policies (and in wartime, large orders) that kept out competitors.
This didn&apos;t seem as dubious to government officials at the time as
it sounds to us. They felt a two-party system ensured sufficient
competition in politics.  It ought to work for business too.<br><br>Gradually the government realized that anti-competitive policies
were doing more harm than good, and during the Carter administration
it started to remove them. The word used for this process was
misleadingly narrow: deregulation.  What was really happening was
de-oligopolization.  It happened to one industry after another.
Two of the most visible to consumers were air travel and long-distance
phone service, which both became dramatically cheaper after
deregulation.<br><br>Deregulation also contributed to the wave of hostile takeovers in
the 1980s.  In the old days the only limit on the inefficiency of
companies, short of actual bankruptcy, was the inefficiency of their
competitors.  Now companies had to face absolute rather than relative
standards.  Any public company that didn&apos;t generate sufficient
returns on its assets risked having its management replaced with
one that would.  Often the new managers did this by breaking companies
up into components that were more valuable separately.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f17n"><font color="#999999">17</font></a>]</font><br><br>Version 1 of the national economy consisted of a few big blocks
whose relationships were negotiated in back rooms by a handful of
executives, politicians, regulators, and labor leaders.  Version 2
was higher resolution: there were more companies, of more different
sizes, making more different things, and their relationships changed
faster. In this world there were still plenty of back room negotiations,
but more was left to market forces.  Which further accelerated the
fragmentation.<br><br>It&apos;s a little misleading to talk of versions when describing a
gradual process, but not as misleading as it might seem.  There was
a lot of change in a few decades, and what we ended up with was
qualitatively different.  The companies in the S&amp;P 500 in 1958 had
been there an average of 61 years. By 2012 that number was 18 years.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f18n"><font color="#999999">18</font></a>]</font><br><br>The breakup of the Duplo economy happened simultaneously with the
spread of computing power. To what extent were computers a precondition?
It would take a book to answer that. Obviously the spread of computing
power was a precondition for the rise of startups.  I suspect it
was for most of what happened in finance too.  But was it a
precondition for globalization or the LBO wave?  I don&apos;t know, but
I wouldn&apos;t discount the possibility.  It may be that the refragmentation
was driven by computers in the way the industrial revolution was
driven by steam engines.  Whether or not computers were a precondition,
they have certainly accelerated it.<br><br>The new fluidity of companies changed people&apos;s relationships with
their employers. Why climb a corporate ladder that might be yanked
out from under you?  Ambitious people started to think of a career
less as climbing a single ladder than as a series of jobs that might
be at different companies. More movement (or even potential movement)
between companies introduced more competition in salaries.  Plus
as companies became smaller it became easier to estimate how much
an employee contributed to the company&apos;s revenue.  Both changes
drove salaries toward market price. And since people vary dramatically
in productivity, paying market price meant salaries started to
diverge.<br><br>By no coincidence it was in the early 1980s that the term &quot;yuppie&quot;
was coined.  That word is not much used now, because the phenomenon
it describes is so taken for granted, but at the time it was a label
for something novel. Yuppies were young professionals who made lots
of money.  To someone in their twenties today, this wouldn&apos;t seem
worth naming.  Why wouldn&apos;t young professionals make lots of money?
But until the 1980s being underpaid early in your career was part
of what it meant to be a professional.  Young professionals were
paying their dues, working their way up the ladder.  The rewards
would come later.  What was novel about yuppies was that they wanted
market price for the work they were doing now.<br><br>The first yuppies did not work for startups. That was still in the
future.  Nor did they work for big companies. They were professionals
working in fields like law, finance, and consulting.  But their example 
rapidly inspired their peers.  Once they saw that new BMW 325i, they 
wanted one too.<br><br>Underpaying people at the beginning of their career only works if
everyone does it. Once some employer breaks ranks, everyone else
has to, or they can&apos;t get good people.  And once started this process
spreads through the whole economy, because at the beginnings of
people&apos;s careers they can easily switch not merely employers but
industries.<br><br>But not all young professionals benefitted. You had to produce to
get paid a lot.  It was no coincidence that the first yuppies worked
in fields where it was easy to measure that.<br><br>More generally, an idea was returning whose name sounds old-fashioned
precisely because it was so rare for so long: that you could make
your fortune.  As in the past there were multiple ways to do it.
Some made their fortunes by creating wealth, and others by playing
zero-sum games. But once it became possible to make one&apos;s fortune,
the ambitious had to decide whether or not to.  A physicist who
chose physics over Wall Street in 1990 was making a sacrifice that
a physicist in 1960 wasn&apos;t.<br><br>The idea even flowed back into big companies.  CEOs of big companies
make more now than they used to, and I think much of the reason is
prestige.  In 1960, corporate CEOs had immense prestige.  They were
the winners of the only economic game in town. But if they made as
little now as they did then, in real dollar terms, they&apos;d seem like
small fry compared to professional athletes and whiz kids making
millions from startups and hedge funds. They don&apos;t like that idea,
so now they try to get as much as they can, which is more than they
had been getting. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f19n"><font color="#999999">19</font></a>]</font><br><br>Meanwhile a similar fragmentation was happening at the other end
of the economic scale.  As big companies&apos; oligopolies became less
secure, they were less able to pass costs on to customers and thus
less willing to overpay for labor.  And as the Duplo world of a few
big blocks fragmented into many companies of different sizes&#x2014;some
of them overseas&#x2014;it became harder for unions to enforce their
monopolies.  As a result workers&apos; wages also tended toward market
price. Which (inevitably, if unions had been doing their job) tended
to be lower.  Perhaps dramatically so, if automation had decreased
the need for some kind of work.<br><br>And just as the mid-century model induced social as well as economic
cohesion, its breakup brought social as well as economic fragmentation.
People started to dress and act differently.  Those who would later
be called the &quot;creative class&quot; became more mobile. People who didn&apos;t
care much for religion felt less pressure to go to church for
appearances&apos; sake, while those who liked it a lot opted for
increasingly colorful forms. Some switched from meat loaf to tofu,
and others to Hot Pockets. Some switched from driving Ford sedans
to driving small imported cars, and others to driving SUVs.  Kids
who went to private schools or wished they did started to dress
&quot;preppy,&quot; and kids who wanted to seem rebellious made a conscious
effort to look disreputable.  In a hundred ways people spread apart.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f20n"><font color="#999999">20</font></a>]</font><br><br>Almost four decades later, fragmentation is still increasing.  Has
it been net good or bad?  I don&apos;t know; the question may be
unanswerable.  Not entirely bad though.  We take for granted the
forms of fragmentation we like, and worry only about the ones we
don&apos;t. But as someone who caught the tail end of mid-century
<a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=well-adjusted&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3"><u>conformism</u></a>, 
I can tell you it was no utopia.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f21n"><font color="#999999">21</font></a>]</font><br><br>My goal here is not to say whether fragmentation has been good or
bad, just to explain why it&apos;s happening.  With the centripetal
forces of total war and 20th century oligopoly mostly gone, what
will happen next?  And more specifically, is it possible to reverse
some of the fragmentation we&apos;ve seen?<br><br>If it is, it will have to happen piecemeal.  You can&apos;t reproduce
mid-century cohesion the way it was originally produced.  It would
be insane to go to war just to induce more national unity.  And
once you understand the degree to which the economic history of the
20th century was a low-res version 1, it&apos;s clear you can&apos;t reproduce
that either.<br><br>20th century cohesion was something that happened at least in a
sense naturally.  The war was due mostly to external forces, and
the Duplo economy was an evolutionary phase.  If you want cohesion
now, you&apos;d have to induce it deliberately.  And it&apos;s not obvious
how.  I suspect the best we&apos;ll be able to do is address the symptoms
of fragmentation.  But that may be enough.<br><br>The form of fragmentation people worry most about lately is <a href="ineq.html"><u>economic inequality</u></a>, and if you want to eliminate
that you&apos;re up against a truly formidable headwind&#x2014;one that has
been in operation since the stone age: technology.  Technology is
a lever. It magnifies work.  And the lever not only grows increasingly
long, but the rate at which it grows is itself increasing.<br><br>Which in turn means the variation in the amount of wealth people
can create has not only been increasing, but accelerating.  The
unusual conditions that prevailed in the mid 20th century masked
this underlying trend.  The ambitious had little choice but to join
large organizations that made them march in step with lots of other
people&#x2014;literally in the case of the armed forces, figuratively
in the case of big corporations. Even if the big corporations had
wanted to pay people proportionate to their value, they couldn&apos;t
have figured out how.  But that constraint has gone now.  Ever since
it started to erode in the 1970s, we&apos;ve seen the underlying forces
at work again.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f22n"><font color="#999999">22</font></a>]</font><br><br>Not everyone who gets rich now does it by creating wealth, certainly.
But a significant number do, and the Baumol Effect means all their
peers get dragged along too.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f23n"><font color="#999999">23</font></a>]</font>
And as long as it&apos;s possible to
get rich by creating wealth, the default tendency will be for
economic inequality to increase.  Even if you eliminate all the
other ways to get rich.  You can mitigate this with subsidies at
the bottom and taxes at the top, but unless taxes are high enough
to discourage people from creating wealth, you&apos;re always going to
be fighting a losing battle against increasing variation in
productivity.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f24n"><font color="#999999">24</font></a>]</font><br><br>That form of fragmentation, like the others, is here to stay.  Or
rather, back to stay.  Nothing is forever, but the tendency toward
fragmentation should be more forever than most things, precisely
because it&apos;s not due to any particular cause.  It&apos;s simply a reversion
to the mean. When Rockefeller said individualism was gone, he was
right for a hundred years.  It&apos;s back now, and that&apos;s likely to be
true for longer.<br><br>I worry that if we don&apos;t acknowledge this, we&apos;re headed for trouble.
If we think 20th century cohesion disappeared because of few policy
tweaks, we&apos;ll be deluded into thinking we can get it back (minus
the bad parts, somehow) with a few countertweaks.  And then we&apos;ll
waste our time trying to eliminate fragmentation, when we&apos;d be
better off thinking about how to mitigate its consequences.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Lester Thurow, writing in 1975, said the wage differentials
prevailing at the end of World War II had become so embedded that
they &quot;were regarded as &apos;just&apos; even after the egalitarian pressures
of World War II had disappeared.  Basically, the same differentials
exist to this day, thirty years later.&quot; But Goldin and Margo think
market forces in the postwar period also helped preserve the wartime
compression of wages&#x2014;specifically increased demand for unskilled
workers, and oversupply of educated ones.<br><br>(Oddly enough, the American custom of having employers pay for
health insurance derives from efforts by businesses to circumvent
NWLB wage controls in order to attract workers.)<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
As always, tax rates don&apos;t tell the whole story.  There were
lots of exemptions, especially for individuals.  And in World War
II the tax codes were so new that the government had little acquired
immunity to tax avoidance.  If the rich paid high taxes during the
war it was more because they wanted to than because they had to.<br><br>After the war, federal tax receipts as a percentage of GDP were
about the same as they are now. In fact, for the entire period since
the war, tax receipts have stayed close to 18% of GDP, despite
dramatic changes in tax rates.  The lowest point occurred when
marginal income tax rates were highest: 14.1% in 1950.  Looking at
the data, it&apos;s hard to avoid the conclusion that tax rates have had
little effect on what people actually paid.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Though in fact the decade preceding the war had been a time
of unprecedented federal power, in response to the Depression.
Which is not entirely a coincidence, because the Depression was one
of the causes of the war.  In many ways the New Deal was a sort of
dress rehearsal for the measures the federal government took during
wartime.  The wartime versions were much more drastic and more
pervasive though.  As Anthony Badger wrote, &quot;for many Americans the
decisive change in their experiences came not with the New Deal but
with World War II.&quot;<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
I don&apos;t know enough about the origins of the world wars to
say, but it&apos;s not inconceivable they were connected to the rise of
big corporations. If that were the case, 20th century cohesion would
have a single cause.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
More precisely, there was a bimodal economy consisting, in
Galbraith&apos;s words, of &quot;the world of the technically dynamic, massively
capitalized and highly organized corporations on the one hand and
the hundreds of thousands of small and traditional proprietors on
the other.&quot; Money, prestige, and power were concentrated in the
former, and there was near zero crossover.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]

Monroeville Mall was at the time of its completion in 1969
the largest in the country. In the late 1970s the movie <i>Dawn of

The relationships between unions and unionized companies can
even be symbiotic, because unions will exert political pressure to
protect their hosts.  According to Michael Lind, when politicians
tried to attack the A&amp;P supermarket chain because it was putting
local grocery stores out of business, &quot;A&amp;P successfully defended
itself by allowing the unionization of its workforce in 1938, thereby
gaining organized labor as a constituency.&quot; I&apos;ve seen this phenomenon
myself: hotel unions are responsible for more of the political
pressure against Airbnb than hotel companies.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
Galbraith was clearly puzzled that corporate executives would
work so hard to make money for other people (the shareholders)
instead of themselves.  He devoted much of <i>The New Industrial
State</i> to trying to figure this out.<br><br>His theory was that professionalism had replaced money as a motive,
and that modern corporate executives were, like (good) scientists,
motivated less by financial rewards than by the desire to do good
work and thereby earn the respect of their peers.  There is something
in this, though I think lack of movement between companies combined
with self-interest explains much of observed behavior.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
Galbraith (p. 94) says a 1952 study of the 800 highest paid

It seems likely that in the first third of the 20th century
executive salaries were low partly because companies then were more
dependent on banks, who would have disapproved if executives got
too much.  This was certainly true in the beginning. The first big
company CEOs were J. P. Morgan&apos;s hired hands.<br><br>Companies didn&apos;t start to finance themselves with retained earnings
till the 1920s.  Till then they had to pay out their earnings in
dividends, and so depended on banks for capital for expansion.
Bankers continued to sit on corporate boards till the Glass-Steagall
act in 1933.<br><br>By mid-century big companies funded 3/4 of their growth from earnings.
But the early years of bank dependence, reinforced by the financial
controls of World War II, must have had a big effect on social
conventions about executive salaries.  So it may be that the lack
of movement between companies was as much the effect of low salaries
as the cause.<br><br>Incidentally, the switch in the 1920s to financing growth with
retained earnings was one cause of the 1929 crash.  The banks now
had to find someone else to lend to, so they made more margin loans.<br><br>[<a name="f15n"><font color="#000000">15</font></a>]
Even now it&apos;s hard to get them to. One of the things I find
hardest to get into the heads of would-be startup founders is how
important it is to do certain kinds of menial work early in the
life of a company.  Doing <a href="ds.html"><u>things that don&apos;t
scale</u></a> is to how Henry Ford got started as a high-fiber diet is

The wave of hostile takeovers in the 1980s was enabled by a
combination of circumstances: court decisions striking down state
anti-takeover laws, starting with the Supreme Court&apos;s 1982 decision
in Edgar v. MITE Corp.; the Reagan administration&apos;s comparatively
sympathetic attitude toward takeovers; the Depository Institutions
Act of 1982, which allowed banks and savings and loans to buy
corporate bonds; a new SEC rule issued in 1982 (rule 415) that made
it possible to bring corporate bonds to market faster; the creation
of the junk bond business by Michael Milken; a vogue for conglomerates
in the preceding period that caused many companies to be combined
that never should have been; a decade of inflation that left many
public companies trading below the value of their assets; and not

CEOs of big companies may be overpaid. I don&apos;t know enough
about big companies to say. But it is certainly not impossible for
a CEO to make 200x as much difference to a company&apos;s revenues as
the average employee.  Look at what Steve Jobs did for Apple when
he came back as CEO.  It would have been a good deal for the board
to give him 95% of the company.  Apple&apos;s market cap the day Steve
came back in July 1997 was 1.73 billion. 5% of Apple now (January
2016) would be worth about 30 billion.  And it would not be if Steve
hadn&apos;t come back; Apple probably wouldn&apos;t even exist anymore.<br><br>Merely including Steve in the sample might be enough to answer the
question of whether public company CEOs in the aggregate are overpaid.
And that is not as facile a trick as it might seem, because the
broader your holdings, the more the aggregate is what you care
about.<br><br>[<a name="f20n"><font color="#000000">20</font></a>]
The late 1960s were famous for social upheaval. But that was
more rebellion (which can happen in any era if people are provoked
sufficiently) than fragmentation.  You&apos;re not seeing fragmentation
unless you see people breaking off to both left and right.<br><br>[<a name="f21n"><font color="#000000">21</font></a>]
Globally the trend has been in the other direction.  While
the US is becoming more fragmented, the world as a whole is becoming
less fragmented, and mostly in good ways.<br><br>[<a name="f22n"><font color="#000000">22</font></a>]
There were a handful of ways to make a fortune in the mid
20th century.  The main one was drilling for oil, which was open
to newcomers because it was not something big companies could
dominate through economies of scale.  How did individuals accumulate
large fortunes in an era of such high taxes?  Giant tax loopholes
defended by two of the most powerful men in Congress, Sam Rayburn
and Lyndon Johnson.<br><br>But becoming a Texas oilman was not in 1950 something one could
aspire to the way starting a startup or going to work on Wall Street
were in 2000, because (a) there was a strong local component and
(b) success depended so much on luck.<br><br>[<a name="f23n"><font color="#000000">23</font></a>]
The Baumol Effect induced by startups is very visible in
Silicon Valley.  Google will pay people millions of dollars a year
to keep them from leaving to start or join startups.<br><br>[<a name="f24n"><font color="#000000">24</font></a>]
I&apos;m not claiming variation in productivity is the only cause
of economic inequality in the US. But it&apos;s a significant cause, and
it will become as big a cause as it needs to, in the sense that if
you ban other ways to get rich, people who want to get rich will
use this route instead.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Patrick

<p> -->
January 2016<br><br>Since the 1970s, economic inequality in the US has increased
dramatically. And in particular, the rich have gotten a lot richer.
Nearly everyone who writes about it says that economic inequality
should be decreased.<br><br>I&apos;m interested in this topic because I was one of the founders of
a company called Y Combinator that helps people start startups.
Almost by definition, if a startup succeeds its founders become
rich. Which means by helping startup founders I&apos;ve been helping to
increase economic inequality.  If economic inequality should be 
decreased, I shouldn&apos;t be helping founders. No one should
be.<br><br>But that doesn&apos;t sound right. So have we just shown, by reductio
ad absurdum, that it&apos;s false that economic inequality should be 
decreased?  That doesn&apos;t sound right either.   Surely it&apos;s bad that some people
are born practically locked into poverty, while at the other extreme
fund managers exploit loopholes to cut their income taxes in half.<br><br>The solution to this puzzle is to realize that economic inequality
is not just one thing.  It consists of some things that are very
bad, like kids with no chance of reaching their potential, and others
that are good, like Larry Page and Sergey Brin starting the company
you use to find things online.<br><br>If you want to understand economic inequality&#x2014;and more importantly,
if you actually want to fix the bad aspects of it&#x2014;you have to
tease apart the components.  And yet the trend in nearly everything
written about the subject is to do the opposite: to squash together
all the aspects of economic inequality as if it were a single
phenomenon.<br><br>Sometimes this is done for ideological reasons.  Sometimes it&apos;s
because the writer only has very high-level data and so draws
conclusions from that, like the proverbial drunk who looks for his
keys under the lamppost, instead of where he dropped them, because the
light is better there.  Sometimes it&apos;s because the writer doesn&apos;t
understand critical aspects of inequality, like the role of technology
in wealth creation.  Much of the time, perhaps most of the time,
writing about economic inequality combines all three.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>The most common mistake people make about economic inequality is
to treat it as a single phenomenon.  The most naive version of which
is the one based on the pie fallacy: that the rich get rich by
taking money from the poor.<br><br>Usually this is an assumption people start from rather than a
conclusion they arrive at by examining the evidence.  Sometimes the
pie fallacy is stated explicitly:
<blockquote>
  ...those at the top are grabbing an increasing fraction of the
  nation&apos;s income&#x2014;so much of a larger share that what&apos;s left over
  for the rest is diminished....
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
Other times it&apos;s more unconscious. But the unconscious form is very
widespread.  I think because we grow up in a world where the pie
fallacy is actually true.  To kids, wealth <i>is</i> a fixed pie
that&apos;s shared out, and if one person gets more it&apos;s at the expense
of another.  It takes a conscious effort to remind oneself that the
real world doesn&apos;t work that way.<br><br>In the real world you can create wealth as well as taking it from
others.  A woodworker creates wealth.  He makes a chair, and you
willingly give him money in return for it.  A high-frequency trader
does not.  He makes a dollar only when someone on the other end of
a trade loses a dollar.<br><br>If the rich people in a society got that way by taking wealth from
the poor, then you have the degenerate case of economic inequality
where the cause of poverty is the same as the cause of wealth.  But
instances of inequality don&apos;t have to be instances of the degenerate
case.  If one woodworker makes 5 chairs and another makes none, the
second woodworker will have less money, but not because anyone took
anything from him.<br><br>Even people sophisticated enough to know about the pie fallacy are
led toward it by the custom of describing economic inequality as a
ratio of one quantile&apos;s income or wealth to another&apos;s.  It&apos;s so
easy to slip from talking about income shifting from one quantile
to another, as a figure of speech, into believing that is literally
what&apos;s happening.<br><br>Except in the degenerate case, economic inequality can&apos;t be described
by a ratio or even a curve.  In the general case it consists of
multiple ways people become poor, and multiple ways people become
rich.  Which means to understand economic inequality in a country,
you have to go find individual people who are poor or rich and
figure out why.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you want to understand <i>change</i> in economic inequality, you
should ask what those people would have done when it was different.
This is one way I know the rich aren&apos;t all getting richer simply
from some new system for transferring wealth to them from
everyone else.  When you use the would-have method with startup
founders, you find what most would have done 
<a href="re.html"><u>back in 1960</u></a>, when
economic inequality was lower, was to join big companies or become
professors.  Before Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook, his default
expectation was that he&apos;d end up working at Microsoft.  The reason
he and most other startup founders are richer than they would have
been in the mid 20th century is not because of some right turn the
country took during the Reagan administration, but because progress
in technology has made it much easier to start a new company that
<a href="growth.html"><u>grows fast</u></a>.<br><br>Traditional economists seem strangely averse to studying individual
humans. It seems to be a rule with them that everything has to start
with statistics.  So they give you very precise numbers about
variation in wealth and income, then follow it with the most naive
speculation about the underlying causes.<br><br>But while there are a lot of people who get rich through rent-seeking
of various forms, and a lot who get rich by playing games that
though not crooked are zero-sum, there are also a significant number
who get rich by creating wealth.  And creating wealth, as a source
of economic inequality, is different from taking it&#x2014;not just
morally, but also practically, in the sense that it is harder to
eradicate.  One reason is that variation in productivity is
accelerating.  The rate at which individuals can create wealth
depends on the technology available to them, and that grows
exponentially. The other reason creating wealth is such a tenacious
source of inequality is that it can expand to accommodate a lot of
people.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>I&apos;m all for shutting down the crooked ways to get rich.  But that
won&apos;t eliminate great variations in wealth, because as long as you leave
open the option of getting rich by creating wealth, people who want
to get rich will do that instead.<br><br>Most people who get rich tend to be fairly driven. Whatever their
other flaws, laziness is usually not one of them.  Suppose new
policies make it hard to make a fortune in finance. Does it seem
plausible that the people who currently go into finance to make
their fortunes will continue to do so but be content to work for
ordinary salaries? The reason they go into finance is not because
they love finance but because they want to get rich. If the only
way left to get rich is to start startups, they&apos;ll start startups.
They&apos;ll do well at it too, because determination is the main factor
in the success of a startup. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
And while it would probably be
a good thing for the world if people who wanted to get rich switched
from playing zero-sum games to creating wealth, that would not only
not eliminate great variations in wealth, but might even 
exacerbate them.
In a zero-sum game there is at least a limit to the upside.  Plus
a lot of the new startups would create new technology that further
accelerated variation in productivity.<br><br>Variation in productivity is far from the only source of economic
inequality, but it is the irreducible core of it, in the sense that
you&apos;ll have that left when you eliminate all other sources. And if
you do, that core will be big, because it will have expanded to
include the efforts of all the refugees.  Plus it will have a large
Baumol penumbra around it: anyone who could get rich by creating
wealth on their own account will have to be paid enough to prevent
them from doing it.<br><br>You can&apos;t prevent great variations in wealth without preventing people
from getting rich, and you can&apos;t do that without preventing them
from starting startups.<br><br>So let&apos;s be clear about that. Eliminating great variations in wealth would
mean eliminating startups.  And that doesn&apos;t seem a wise move.
Especially since it would only mean you eliminated
startups in your own country.  Ambitious people already move halfway
around the world to further their careers, and startups can operate
from anywhere nowadays.  So if you made it impossible to get rich
by creating wealth in your country, people who wanted to do that
would just leave and do it somewhere else. Which would
certainly get you a lower Gini coefficient, along with a lesson in
being careful what you ask for. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>I think rising economic inequality is the inevitable fate of countries
that don&apos;t choose something worse. We had a 40 year stretch in the
middle of the 20th century that convinced some people otherwise.
But as I explained in <a href="re.html">The Refragmentation</a>,
that was an anomaly&#x2014;a
unique combination of circumstances that compressed American society
not just economically but culturally too.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>And while some of the growth in economic inequality we&apos;ve seen since
then has been due to bad behavior of various kinds, there has
simultaneously been a huge increase in individuals&apos; ability to
create wealth.  Startups are almost entirely a product of this
period. And even within the startup world, there has been a qualitative
change in the last 10 years.  Technology has decreased the cost of
starting a startup so much that founders now have the upper hand
over investors.  Founders get less diluted, and it is now common
for them to retain board control as well.  Both further increase
economic inequality, the former because founders own more stock,
and the latter because, as investors have learned, founders tend
to be better at running their companies than investors.<br><br>While the surface manifestations change, the underlying forces are
very, very old.  The acceleration of productivity we see in Silicon
Valley has been happening for thousands of years.  If you look at
the history of stone tools, technology was already accelerating in
the Mesolithic.  The acceleration would have been too slow to
perceive in one lifetime.  Such is the nature of the leftmost part
of an exponential curve.  But it was the same curve.<br><br>You do not want to design your society in a way that&apos;s incompatible
with this curve. The evolution of technology is one of the most
powerful forces in history.<br><br>Louis Brandeis said &quot;We may have democracy, or we may have wealth
concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can&apos;t have both.&quot; That
sounds plausible.  But if I have to choose between ignoring him and
ignoring an exponential curve that has been operating for thousands
of years, I&apos;ll bet on the curve.  Ignoring any trend that has been
operating for thousands of years is dangerous.  But exponential
growth especially tends to bite you.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>If accelerating variation in productivity is always going to produce
some baseline growth in economic inequality, it would be a good
idea to spend some time thinking about that future.  Can you have
a healthy society with great variation in wealth?  What would it
look like?<br><br>Notice how novel it feels to think about that.  The public conversation
so far has been exclusively about the need to decrease economic
inequality.  We&apos;ve barely given a thought to how to live with it.<br><br>I&apos;m hopeful we&apos;ll be able to.  Brandeis was a product of the Gilded
Age, and things have changed since then. It&apos;s harder to hide
wrongdoing now.  And to get rich now you don&apos;t have to buy politicians
the way railroad or oil magnates did. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font>
The great concentrations
of wealth I see around me in Silicon Valley don&apos;t seem to be
destroying democracy.<br><br>There are lots of things wrong with the US that have economic
inequality as a symptom. We should fix those things.  In the process
we may decrease economic inequality. But we can&apos;t start from the
symptom and hope to fix the underlying causes.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>The most obvious is poverty. I&apos;m sure most of those who want to
decrease economic inequality want to do it mainly to help the poor,
not to hurt the rich. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font>
Indeed, a good number are merely being
sloppy by speaking of decreasing economic inequality when what they
mean is decreasing poverty.  But this is a situation where it would
be good to be precise about what we want.  Poverty and economic
inequality are not identical.  When the city is turning off your
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/07/what-happens-when-detroit-shuts-off-the-water-of-100000-people/374548/"><u>water</u></a>
because you can&apos;t pay the bill, it doesn&apos;t make any difference
what Larry Page&apos;s net worth is compared to yours.  He might only
be a few times richer than you, and it would still be just as much
of a problem that your water was getting turned off.<br><br>Closely related to poverty is lack of social mobility.  I&apos;ve seen
this myself: you don&apos;t have to grow up rich or even upper middle
class to get rich as a startup founder, but few successful founders
grew up desperately poor.  But again, the problem here is not simply
economic inequality.  There is an enormous difference in wealth
between the household Larry Page grew up in and that of a successful
startup founder, but that didn&apos;t prevent him from joining their
ranks.  It&apos;s not economic inequality per se that&apos;s blocking social
mobility, but some specific combination of things that go wrong
when kids grow up sufficiently poor.<br><br>One of the most important principles in Silicon Valley is that &quot;you
make what you measure.&quot;  It means that if you pick some number to
focus on, it will tend to improve, but that you have to choose the
right number, because only the one you choose will improve; another
that seems conceptually adjacent might not.  For example, if you&apos;re
a university president and you decide to focus on graduation rates,
then you&apos;ll improve graduation rates.  But only graduation rates,
not how much students learn.  Students could learn less, if to
improve graduation rates you made classes easier.<br><br>Economic inequality is sufficiently far from identical with the
various problems that have it as a symptom that we&apos;ll probably only
hit whichever of the two we aim at.  If we aim at economic inequality,
we won&apos;t fix these problems.  So I say let&apos;s aim at the problems.<br><br>For example, let&apos;s attack poverty, and if necessary damage wealth
in the process. That&apos;s much more likely to work than attacking
wealth in the hope that you will thereby fix poverty.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font>
And if
there are people getting rich by tricking consumers or lobbying the
government for anti-competitive regulations or tax loopholes, then
let&apos;s stop them. Not because it&apos;s causing economic inequality, but
because it&apos;s stealing.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>If all you have is statistics, it seems like that&apos;s what you need
to fix. But behind a broad statistical measure like economic
inequality there are some things that are good and some that are
bad, some that are historical trends with immense momentum and
others that are random accidents.  If we want to fix the world
behind the statistics, we have to understand it, and focus our
efforts where they&apos;ll do the most good.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]

Particularly since economic inequality is a matter of outliers,
and outliers are disproportionately likely to have gotten where
they are by ways that have little do with the sort of things
economists usually think about, like wages and productivity, but
rather by, say, ending up on the wrong side of the &quot;War on Drugs.&quot;<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Determination is the most important factor in deciding between
success and failure, which in startups tend to be sharply differentiated.
But it takes more than determination to create one of the hugely
successful startups.  Though most founders start out excited about
the idea of getting rich, purely mercenary founders will usually
take one of the big acquisition offers most successful startups get
on the way up.  The founders who go on to the next stage tend to
be driven by a sense of mission.  They have the same attachment to
their companies that an artist or writer has to their work.  But
it is very hard to predict at the outset which founders will do
that. It&apos;s not simply a function of their initial attitude.  Starting
a company changes people.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
After reading a draft of this essay, Richard Florida told me
how he had once talked to a group of Europeans &quot;who said
 they wanted to make Europe more entrepreneurial and more
  like Silicon Valley. I said by definition this will give you more
  inequality.  They thought I was insane&#x2014;they could not process
  it.&quot;<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Economic inequality has been decreasing globally.  But this
is mainly due to the erosion of the kleptocracies that formerly
dominated all the poorer countries.  Once the playing field is
leveler politically, we&apos;ll see economic inequality start to rise
again. The US is the bellwether.  The situation we face here, the
rest of the world will sooner or later.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Some people still get rich by buying politicians.  My point is that
it&apos;s no longer a precondition.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
As well as problems that have economic inequality as a symptom,
there are those that have it as a cause.  But in most if not all,
economic inequality is not the primary cause.  There is usually
some injustice that is allowing economic inequality to turn into
other forms of inequality, and that injustice is what we need to
fix.  For example, the police in the US treat the poor worse than
the rich.  But the solution is not to make people richer. It&apos;s to
make the police treat people more equitably.  Otherwise they&apos;ll
continue to maltreat people who are weak in other ways.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Some who read this essay will say that I&apos;m clueless or even
being deliberately misleading by focusing so much on the richer end
of economic inequality&#x2014;that economic inequality is really about
poverty. But that is exactly the point I&apos;m making, though sloppier
language than I&apos;d use to make it.  The real problem is poverty, not
economic inequality.  And if you conflate them you&apos;re aiming at the
wrong target.<br><br>Others will say I&apos;m clueless or being misleading by focusing on
people who get rich by creating wealth&#x2014;that startups aren&apos;t the
problem, but corrupt practices in finance, healthcare, and so on.
Once again, that is exactly my point.  The problem is not economic
inequality, but those specific abuses.<br><br>It&apos;s a strange task to write an essay about why something isn&apos;t the
problem, but that&apos;s the situation you find yourself in when so many
people mistakenly think it is.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Particularly since many causes of poverty are only partially
driven by people trying to make money from them. For example,
America&apos;s abnormally high incarceration rate is a major cause of
poverty.  But although <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/28/how-for-profit-prisons-have-become-the-biggest-lobby-no-one-is-talking-about/"><u>for-profit prison companies</u></a> and 
<a href="http://mic.com/articles/41531/union-of-the-snake-how-california-s-prison-guards-subvert-democracy"><u>prison guard unions</u></a> both spend 
a lot lobbying for harsh sentencing laws, they
are not the original source of them.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
Incidentally, tax loopholes are definitely not a product
of some power shift due to recent increases in economic inequality.
The golden age of economic equality in the mid 20th century was
also the golden age of tax avoidance. Indeed, it was so widespread
and so effective that I&apos;m skeptical whether economic inequality was
really so low then as we think.  In a period when people are trying
to hide wealth from the government, it will tend to be hidden from
statistics too. One sign of the potential magnitude of the problem
is the discrepancy between government receipts as a percentage of
GDP, which have remained more or less constant during the entire
period from the end of World War II to the present, and tax rates,
which have varied dramatically.<br><br>

When I was a kid I used to wonder
about this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining
about its finiteness?  Would we be just as likely to feel life was
short if we lived 10 times as long?<br><br>Since there didn&apos;t seem any way to answer this question, I stopped
wondering about it.  Then I had kids.  That gave me a way to answer
the question, and the answer is that life actually is short.<br><br>Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time,
into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year
old.  If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only
get to watch your child experience it 8 times.  And while it&apos;s
impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity
like time, 8 is not a lot of something.  If you had a handful of 8
peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would
definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.<br><br>Ok, so life actually is short.  Does it make any difference to know
that?<br><br>It has for me.  It means arguments of the form &quot;Life is too short
for x&quot; have great force.  It&apos;s not just a figure of speech to say
that life is too short for something.  It&apos;s not just a synonym for
annoying.  If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for
something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.<br><br>When I ask myself what I&apos;ve found life is too short for, the word
that pops into my head is &quot;bullshit.&quot; I realize that answer is
somewhat tautological.  It&apos;s almost the definition of bullshit that
it&apos;s the stuff that life is too short for.  And yet bullshit does
have a distinctive character.  There&apos;s something fake about it.
It&apos;s the junk food of experience.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that&apos;s bullshit,
you probably already know the answer.  Unnecessary meetings, pointless
disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people&apos;s
mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.<br><br>There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it&apos;s
either forced on you or it tricks you.  To some extent you have to
put up with the bullshit forced on you by circumstances.  You need
to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands.  Indeed,
the law of supply and demand insures that: the more rewarding some
kind of work is, the cheaper people will do it.  It may be that
less bullshit is forced on you than you think, though.  There has
always been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and
go live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional
sense, but life feels more authentic.  This could become more common.<br><br>You can do it on a smaller scale without moving.  The amount of
time you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers.  Most
large organizations (and many small ones) are steeped in it.  But
if you consciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factors
like money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will
waste less of your time.<br><br>If you&apos;re a freelancer or a small company, you can do this at the
level of individual customers.  If you fire or avoid toxic customers,
you can decrease the amount of bullshit in your life by more than
you decrease your income.<br><br>But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the
bullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one&apos;s
fault but your own.  And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder
to eliminate than the bullshit that&apos;s forced on you.  Things that
lure you into wasting your time on them have to be really good at
tricking you.  An example that will be familiar to a lot of people
is arguing online.  When someone
contradicts you, they&apos;re in a sense attacking you. Sometimes pretty
overtly.  Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself.  But
like a lot of instincts, this one wasn&apos;t designed for the world we
now live in.  Counterintuitive as it feels, it&apos;s better most of
the time not to defend yourself.  Otherwise these people are literally
taking your life.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Arguing online is only incidentally addictive. There are more
dangerous things than that. As I&apos;ve written before, one byproduct
of technical progress is that things we like tend to become <a href="addiction.html"><u>more
addictive</u></a>.  Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious
effort to avoid addictions&#x2014;to stand outside ourselves and ask &quot;is
this how I want to be spending my time?&quot;<br><br>As well as avoiding bullshit one should actively seek out things
that matter.  But different things matter to different people, and
most have to learn what matters to them.  A few are lucky and realize
early on that they love math or taking care of animals or writing,
and then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it.  But
most people start out with a life that&apos;s a mix of things that
matter and things that don&apos;t, and only gradually learn to distinguish
between them.<br><br>For the young especially, much of this confusion is induced by the
artificial situations they find themselves in. In middle school and
high school, what the other kids think of you seems the most important
thing in the world.  But when you ask adults what they got wrong
at that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kids
thought of them.<br><br>One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask
yourself whether you&apos;ll care about it in the future.  Fake stuff
that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter.  That&apos;s
how it tricks you.  The area under the curve is small, but its shape
jabs into your consciousness like a pin.<br><br>The things that matter aren&apos;t necessarily the ones people would
call &quot;important.&quot;  Having coffee with a friend matters.  You won&apos;t
feel later like that was a waste of time.<br><br>One great thing about having small children is that they make you
spend time on things that matter: them. They grab your sleeve as
you&apos;re staring at your phone and say &quot;will you play with me?&quot; And
odds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option.<br><br>If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by
surprise. And that is just what tends to happen.  You take things
for granted, and then they&apos;re gone.  You think you can always write
that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize
the window has closed.  The saddest windows close when other people
die. Their lives are short too.  After my mother died, I wished I&apos;d
spent more time with her.  I lived as if she&apos;d always be there.
And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion.  But an
illusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I
did.<br><br>The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to
be consciously aware of it.  Back when life was more precarious,
people used to be aware of death to a degree that would now seem a
bit morbid.  I&apos;m not sure why, but it doesn&apos;t seem the right answer
to be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at
everyone&apos;s shoulder.  Perhaps a better solution is to look at the
problem from the other end. Cultivate a habit of impatience about
the things you most want to do. Don&apos;t wait before climbing that
mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother.  You don&apos;t
need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn&apos;t wait.
Just don&apos;t wait.<br><br>I can think of two more things one does when one doesn&apos;t have much
of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has.  Both
make sense here.<br><br>How you live affects how long you live.  Most people could do better.
Me among them.<br><br>But you can probably get even more effect by paying closer attention
to the time you have.  It&apos;s easy to let the days rush by.  The
&quot;flow&quot; that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousin
that prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurry
of errands and alarms.  One of the most striking things I&apos;ve read
was not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter&apos;s <i>Burning
the Days</i>.<br><br>It is possible to slow time somewhat. I&apos;ve gotten better at it.
Kids help.  When you have small children, there are a lot of moments
so perfect that you can&apos;t help noticing.<br><br>It does help too to feel that you&apos;ve squeezed everything out of
some experience.  The reason I&apos;m sad about my mother is not just
that I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have
done that we didn&apos;t.  My oldest son will be 7 soon.  And while I
miss the 3 year old version of him, I at least don&apos;t have any regrets
over what might have been.  We had the best time a daddy and a 3
year old ever had.<br><br>Relentlessly prune bullshit, don&apos;t wait to do things that matter,
and savor the time you have.  That&apos;s what you do when life is short.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
At first I didn&apos;t like it that the word that came to mind was
one that had other meanings.  But then I realized the other meanings
are fairly closely related.  Bullshit in the sense of things you
waste your time on is a lot like intellectual bullshit.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
I chose this example deliberately as a note to self.  I get
attacked a lot online.  People tell the craziest lies about me.
And I have so far done a pretty mediocre job of suppressing the
natural human inclination to say &quot;Hey, that&apos;s not true!&quot;<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts

Much of it will apply to other towns.  But not all, because
as I say in the talk, Pittsburgh has some important advantages over
most would-be startup hubs.)</i><br><br>What would it take to make Pittsburgh into a startup hub, like
Silicon Valley?  I feel like I understand Pittsburgh pretty well,
because I grew up here, in Monroeville. And I understand Silicon
Valley pretty well because that&apos;s where I live now.  Could you get
that kind of startup ecosystem going here?<br><br>When I agreed to speak here, I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d be able to give a
very optimistic talk.  I thought I&apos;d be talking about what Pittsburgh
could do to become a startup hub, very much in the subjunctive.
Instead I&apos;m going to talk about what Pittsburgh can do.<br><br>What changed my mind was an article I read in, of all places, the <i>New
York Times</i> food section.  The title was &quot;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/dining/pittsburgh-restaurants.html"><u>Pittsburgh&apos;s Youth-Driven
Food Boom</u></a>.&quot;  To most people that might not even sound interesting,
let alone something related to startups.  But it was electrifying
to me to read that title.  I don&apos;t think I could pick a more promising
one if I tried.  And when I read the article I got even more excited.
It said &quot;people ages 25 to 29 now make up 7.6 percent of all
residents, up from 7 percent about a decade ago.&quot;  Wow, I thought,
Pittsburgh could be the next Portland.  It could become the cool
place all the people in their twenties want to go live.<br><br>When I got here a couple days ago, I could feel the difference.  I
lived here from 1968 to 1984.  I didn&apos;t realize it at the time, but
during that whole period the city was in free fall. On top of the
flight to the suburbs that happened everywhere, the steel and nuclear
businesses were both dying. Boy are things different now.  It&apos;s not
just that downtown seems a lot more prosperous. There is an energy
here that was not here when I was a kid.<br><br>When I was a kid, this was a place young people left. Now it&apos;s a
place that attracts them.<br><br>What does that have to do with startups?  Startups are made
of people, and the average age of the people in a typical startup
is right in that 25 to 29 bracket.<br><br>I&apos;ve seen how powerful it is for a city to have those people.  Five
years ago they shifted the center of gravity of Silicon Valley from
the peninsula to San Francisco.  Google and Facebook are on the
peninsula, but the next generation of big winners are all in SF.
The reason the center of gravity shifted was the talent war, for
programmers especially.  Most 25 to 29 year olds want to live in
the city, not down in the boring suburbs.  So whether they like it
or not, founders know they have to be in the city.  I know multiple
founders who would have preferred to live down in the Valley proper,
but who made themselves move to SF because they knew otherwise
they&apos;d lose the talent war.<br><br>So being a magnet for people in their twenties is a very promising
thing to be.  It&apos;s hard to imagine a place becoming a startup hub
without also being that.  When I read that statistic about the
increasing percentage of 25 to 29 year olds, I had exactly the same
feeling of excitement I get when I see a startup&apos;s graphs start to
creep upward off the x axis.<br><br>Nationally the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds is 6.8%.  That means
you&apos;re .8% ahead.  The population is 306,000, so we&apos;re talking about
a surplus of about 2500 people.  That&apos;s the population of a small
town, and that&apos;s just the surplus. So you have a toehold.  Now you
just have to expand it.<br><br>And though &quot;youth-driven food boom&quot; may sound frivolous, it is
anything but.  Restaurants and cafes are a big part of the personality
of a city.  Imagine walking down a street in Paris. What are you
walking past?  Little restaurants and cafes.  Imagine driving through
some depressing random exurb.  What are you driving past?  Starbucks
and McDonalds and Pizza Hut.   As Gertrude Stein said, there is no
there there. You could be anywhere.<br><br>These independent restaurants and cafes are not just feeding people.
They&apos;re making there be a there here.<br><br>So here is my first concrete recommendation for turning Pittsburgh
into the next Silicon Valley: do everything you can to encourage
this youth-driven food boom.  What could the city do?  Treat the
people starting these little restaurants and cafes as your users,
and go ask them what they want.  I can guess at least one thing
they might want: a fast permit process.  San Francisco has left you
a huge amount of room to beat them in that department.<br><br>I know restaurants aren&apos;t the prime mover though.  The prime mover,
as the Times article said, is cheap housing.  That&apos;s a big advantage.
But that phrase &quot;cheap housing&quot; is a bit misleading.  There are
plenty of places that are cheaper.  What&apos;s special about Pittsburgh
is not that it&apos;s cheap, but that it&apos;s a cheap place you&apos;d actually
want to live.<br><br>Part of that is the buildings themselves. I realized a long time
ago, back when I was a poor twenty-something myself, that the best
deals were places that had once been rich, and then became poor.
If a place has always been rich, it&apos;s nice but too expensive.  If
a place has always been poor, it&apos;s cheap but grim.  But if a place
was once rich and then got poor, you can find palaces for cheap.
And that&apos;s what&apos;s bringing people here.  When Pittsburgh was rich,
a hundred years ago, the people who lived here built big solid
buildings.  Not always in the best taste, but definitely solid.  So
here is another piece of advice for becoming a startup hub: don&apos;t
destroy the buildings that are bringing people here.  When cities
are on the way back up, like Pittsburgh is now, developers race to
tear down the old buildings.  Don&apos;t let that happen.  Focus on
historic preservation.  Big real estate development projects are
not what&apos;s bringing the twenty-somethings here.  They&apos;re the opposite
of the new restaurants and cafes; they subtract personality from
the city.<br><br>The empirical evidence suggests you cannot be too strict about
historic preservation.  The tougher cities are about it, the better
they seem to do.<br><br>But the appeal of Pittsburgh is not just the buildings themselves,
but the neighborhoods they&apos;re in. Like San Francisco and New York,
Pittsburgh is fortunate in being a pre-car city.  It&apos;s not too
spread out. Because those 25 to 29 year olds do not like driving.
They prefer walking, or bicycling, or taking public transport.  If
you&apos;ve been to San Francisco recently you can&apos;t help noticing the
huge number of bicyclists.  And this is not just a fad that the
twenty-somethings have adopted.  In this respect they have discovered
a better way to live.  The beards will go, but not the bikes.  Cities
where you can get around without driving are just better period.
So I would suggest you do everything you can to capitalize on this.
As with historic preservation, it seems impossible to go too far.<br><br>Why not make Pittsburgh the most bicycle and pedestrian friendly
city in the country?  See if you can go so far that you make San
Francisco seem backward by comparison.  If you do, it&apos;s very unlikely
you&apos;ll regret it.  The city will seem like a paradise to the young
people you want to attract.  If they do leave to get jobs elsewhere,
it will be with regret at leaving behind such a place.  And what&apos;s
the downside?  Can you imagine a headline &quot;City ruined by becoming
too bicycle-friendly?&quot;  It just doesn&apos;t happen.<br><br>So suppose cool old neighborhoods and cool little restaurants make
this the next Portland.  Will that be enough?  It will put you in
a way better position than Portland itself, because Pittsburgh has
something Portland lacks: a first-rate research university.  CMU
plus little cafes means you have more than hipsters drinking lattes.
It means you have hipsters drinking lattes while talking about
distributed systems.  Now you&apos;re getting really close to San
Francisco.<br><br>In fact you&apos;re better off than San Francisco in one way, because
CMU is downtown, but Stanford and Berkeley are out in the suburbs.<br><br>What can CMU do to help Pittsburgh become a startup hub?  Be an
even better research university.  CMU is one of the best universities
in the world, but imagine what things would be like if it were the
very best, and everyone knew it.  There are a lot of ambitious
people who must go to the best place, wherever it is&#x2014;if it&apos;s in
Siberia.  If CMU were it, they would all come here. There would be
kids in Kazakhstan dreaming of one day living in Pittsburgh.<br><br>Being that kind of talent magnet is the most important contribution
universities can make toward making their city a startup hub.  In
fact it is practically the only contribution they can make.<br><br>But wait, shouldn&apos;t universities be setting up programs with words
like &quot;innovation&quot; and &quot;entrepreneurship&quot; in their names?  No, they
should not.  These kind of things almost always turn out to be
disappointments.  They&apos;re pursuing the wrong targets.  The way to
get innovation is not to aim for innovation but to aim for something
more specific, like better batteries or better 3D printing.  And
the way to learn about entrepreneurship is to do it, which you can&apos;t
in school.<br><br>I know it may disappoint some administrators to hear that the best
thing a university can do to encourage startups is to be a great
university.  It&apos;s like telling people who want to lose weight that
the way to do it is to eat less.<br><br>But if you want to know where startups come from, look at the
empirical evidence.  Look at the histories of the most successful
startups, and you&apos;ll find they grow organically out of a couple of
founders building something that starts as an interesting side
project.  Universities are great at bringing together founders, but
beyond that the best thing they can do is get out of the way.  For
example, by not claiming ownership of &quot;intellectual property&quot; that
students and faculty develop, and by having liberal rules about
deferred admission and leaves of absence.<br><br>In fact, one of the most effective things a university could do to
encourage startups is an elaborate form of getting out of the way
invented by Harvard.  Harvard used to have exams for the fall
semester after Christmas.  At the beginning of January they had
something called &quot;Reading Period&quot; when you were supposed to be
studying for exams.  And Microsoft and Facebook have something in
common that few people realize: they were both started during Reading
Period.  It&apos;s the perfect situaton for producing the sort of side
projects that turn into startups. The students are all on campus,
but they don&apos;t have to do anything because they&apos;re supposed to be
studying for exams.<br><br>Harvard may have closed this window, because a few years ago they
moved exams before Christmas and shortened reading period from 11
days to 7.  But if a university really wanted to help its students
start startups, the empirical evidence, weighted by market cap,
suggests the best thing they can do is literally nothing.<br><br>The culture of Pittsburgh is another of its strengths.  It seems
like a city has to be very socially liberal to be a startup hub,
and it&apos;s pretty clear why. A city has to tolerate strangeness to
be a home for startups, because startups are so strange.  And you
can&apos;t choose to allow just the forms of strangeness that will turn
into big startups, because they&apos;re all intermingled.  You have to
tolerate all strangeness.<br><br>That immediately rules out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/us/gay-rights-mississippi-north-carolina.html"><u>big chunks of the US</u></a>.  I&apos;m optimistic
it doesn&apos;t rule out Pittsburgh.  One of the things I remember from
growing up here, though I didn&apos;t realize at the time that there was
anything unusual about it, is how well people got along.  I&apos;m still
not sure why.  Maybe one reason was that everyone felt like an
immigrant.  When I was a kid in Monroeville, people didn&apos;t call
themselves American.  They called themselves Italian or Serbian or
Ukranian.  Just imagine what it must have been like here a hundred
years ago, when people were pouring in from twenty different
countries.  Tolerance was the only option.<br><br>What I remember about the culture of Pittsburgh is that it was
both tolerant and pragmatic.  That&apos;s how I&apos;d describe the culture
of Silicon Valley too.  And it&apos;s not a coincidence, because Pittsburgh
was the Silicon Valley of its time.  This was a city where people
built new things.  And while the things people build have changed,
the spirit you need to do that kind of work is the same.<br><br>So although an influx of latte-swilling hipsters may be annoying
in some ways, I would go out of my way to encourage them.  And more
generally to tolerate strangeness, even unto the degree wacko
Californians do.  For Pittsburgh that is a conservative choice:
it&apos;s a return to the city&apos;s roots.<br><br>Unfortunately I saved the toughest part for last. There is one more
thing you need to be a startup hub, and Pittsburgh hasn&apos;t got it:
investors.  Silicon Valley has a big investor community because
it&apos;s had 50 years to grow one.  New York has a big investor community
because it&apos;s full of people who like money a lot and are quick to
notice new ways to get it.  But Pittsburgh has neither of these.
And the cheap housing that draws other people here has no effect
on investors.<br><br>If an investor community grows up here, it will happen the same way
it did in Silicon Valley: slowly and organically.  So I would not
bet on having a big investor community in the short term.  But
fortunately there are three trends that make that less necessary
than it used to be.  One is that startups are increasingly cheap
to start, so you just don&apos;t need as much outside money as you used
to.  The second is that thanks to things like Kickstarter, a startup
can get to revenue faster.  You can put something on Kickstarter
from anywhere.  The third is programs like Y Combinator.  A startup
from anywhere in the world can go to YC for 3 months, pick up
funding, and then return home if they want.<br><br>My advice is to make Pittsburgh a great place for startups, and
gradually more of them will stick.  Some of those will succeed;
some of their founders will become investors; and still more startups
will stick.<br><br>This is not a fast path to becoming a startup hub. But it is at
least a path, which is something few other cities have.  And it&apos;s
not as if you have to make painful sacrifices in the meantime.
Think about what I&apos;ve suggested you should do.  Encourage local
restaurants, save old buildings, take advantage of density, make
CMU the best, promote tolerance.  These are the things that make
Pittsburgh good to live in now.  All I&apos;m saying is that you should
do even more of them.<br><br>And that&apos;s an encouraging thought.  If Pittsburgh&apos;s path to becoming
a startup hub is to be even more itself, then it has a good chance
of succeeding.  In fact it probably has the best chance of any city
its size.  It will take some effort, and a lot of time, but if any
city can do it, Pittsburgh can.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Charlie Cheever and Jessica Livingston for reading

on your ballot this year: Proposition 62, which bans the death
penalty.<br><br>When I was younger I used to think the debate about the death
penalty was about when it&apos;s ok to take a human life.  Is it ok
to kill a killer?<br><br>But that is not the issue here.<br><br>The real world does not work like the version I was shown on TV growing up.  The police 
often arrest the wrong person.
Defendants&apos; lawyers are often incompetent.  And prosecutors
are often motivated more by publicity than justice.<br><br>In the real world,       
<a href="http://time.com/79572/more-innocent-people-on-death-row-than-estimated-study/">about 4%</a> of people sentenced to death
are innocent.
So this is not about whether it&apos;s ok to kill killers. This
is about whether it&apos;s ok to kill innocent people.<br><br>A child could answer that one for you.<br><br>This year, in California, you have a chance to end this, by
voting yes on Proposition 62. But beware, because there is another 
proposition, Proposition 66, whose goal is to make it 
easier to execute people. So yes on 62, no on 66.<br><br>It&apos;s time.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="disc">The Risk of Discovery</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">January 2017<br><br>Because biographies of famous scientists tend to 
edit out their mistakes, we underestimate the 
degree of risk they were willing to take.
And because anything a famous scientist did that
wasn&apos;t a mistake has probably now become the
conventional wisdom, those choices don&apos;t
seem risky either.<br><br>Biographies of Newton, for example, understandably focus
more on physics than alchemy or theology.
The impression we get is that his unerring judgment
led him straight to truths no one else had noticed.
How to explain all the time he spent on alchemy
and theology?  Well, smart people are often kind of
crazy.<br><br>But maybe there is a simpler explanation. Maybe
the smartness and the craziness were not as separate
as we think. Physics seems to us a promising thing
to work on, and alchemy and theology obvious wastes
of time. But that&apos;s because we know how things
turned out. In Newton&apos;s day the three problems 
seemed roughly equally promising. No one knew yet
what the payoff would be for inventing what we
now call physics; if they had, more people would 
have been working on it. And alchemy and theology
were still then in the category Marc Andreessen would 
describe as &quot;huge, if true.&quot;<br><br>Newton made three bets. One of them worked. But 
they were all risky.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr valign="top"><td></td><td><img src="http://ep.yimg.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></td><td><br><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr valign="top"><td width="435"><h1 id="pow">Charisma / Power</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">January 2017<br><br>People who are powerful but uncharismatic will tend to be disliked.
Their power makes them a target for criticism that they don&apos;t have
the charisma to disarm. That was Hillary Clinton&apos;s problem. It also
tends to be a problem for any CEO who is more of a builder than a
schmoozer. And yet the builder-type CEO is (like Hillary) probably
the best person for the job.<br><br>I don&apos;t think there is any solution to this problem. It&apos;s human
nature. The best we can do is to recognize that it&apos;s happening, and
to understand that being a magnet for criticism is sometimes a sign
not that someone is the wrong person for a job, but that they&apos;re
the right one.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="435"><tr><td><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
