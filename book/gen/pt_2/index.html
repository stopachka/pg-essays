poorer people are, the more stuff they seem to have.  Hardly anyone
is so poor that they can't afford a front yard full of old cars.<br><br>It wasn't always this way.  Stuff used to be rare and valuable.
You can still see evidence of that if you look for it.  For example,
in my house in Cambridge, which was built in 1876, the bedrooms
don't have closets.  In those days people's stuff fit in a chest
of drawers.  Even as recently as a few decades ago there was a lot
less stuff.  When I look back at photos from the 1970s, I'm surprised
how empty houses look.  As a kid I had what I thought was a huge
fleet of toy cars, but they'd be dwarfed by the number of toys my
nephews have.  All together my Matchboxes and Corgis took up about
a third of the surface of my bed.  In my nephews' rooms the bed is
the only clear space.<br><br>Stuff has gotten a lot cheaper, but our attitudes toward it haven't
changed correspondingly.  We overvalue stuff.<br><br>That was a big problem
for me when I had no money.  I felt poor, and stuff seemed valuable,
so almost instinctively I accumulated it.  Friends would leave
something behind when they moved, or I'd see something as I was
walking down the street on trash night (beware of anything you find
yourself describing as "perfectly good"), or I'd find something in
almost new condition for a tenth its retail price at a garage sale.
And pow, more stuff.<br><br>In fact these free or nearly free things weren't bargains, because
they were worth even less than they cost.  Most of the stuff I
accumulated was worthless, because I didn't need it.<br><br>What I didn't understand was that the value of some new acquisition
wasn't the difference between its retail price and what I paid for
it.  It was the value I derived from it.  Stuff is an extremely
illiquid asset.  Unless you have some plan for selling that valuable
thing you got so cheaply, what difference does it make what it's
"worth?"  The only way you're ever going to extract any value from
it is to use it.  And if you don't have any immediate use for it,
you probably never will.<br><br>Companies that sell stuff have spent huge sums training us to think
stuff is still valuable.  But it would be closer to the truth to
treat stuff as worthless.<br><br>In fact, worse than worthless, because once you've accumulated a
certain amount of stuff, it starts to own you rather than the other
way around.  I know of one couple who couldn't retire to the town
they preferred because they couldn't afford a place there big enough
for all their stuff.  Their house isn't theirs; it's their stuff's.<br><br>And unless you're extremely organized, a house full of stuff can
be very depressing. A cluttered room saps one's spirits.  One
reason, obviously, is that there's less room for people in a room
full of stuff.  But there's more going on than that.  I think humans
constantly scan their environment to build a mental model of what's
around them.  And the harder a scene is to parse, the less energy
you have left for conscious thoughts.  A cluttered room is literally
exhausting.<br><br>(This could explain why clutter doesn't seem to bother kids as much
as adults. Kids are less perceptive.  They build a coarser model
of their surroundings, and this consumes less energy.)<br><br>I first realized the worthlessness of stuff when I lived in Italy
for a year.  All I took with me was one large backpack of stuff.
The rest of my stuff I left in my landlady's attic back in the US.
And you know what?  All I missed were some of the books.  By the
end of the year I couldn't even remember what else I had stored in
that attic.<br><br>And yet when I got back I didn't discard so much as a box of it.
Throw away a perfectly good rotary telephone?  I might need that
one day.<br><br>The really painful thing to recall is not just that I accumulated
all this useless stuff, but that I often spent money I desperately
needed on stuff that I didn't.<br><br>Why would I do that?  Because the people whose job is to sell you
stuff are really, really good at it.  The average 25 year old is
no match for companies that have spent years figuring out how to
get you to spend money on stuff.  They make the experience of buying
stuff so pleasant that "shopping" becomes a leisure activity.<br><br>How do you protect yourself from these people?  It can't be easy.
I'm a fairly skeptical person, and their tricks worked on me well
into my thirties.  But one thing that might work is to ask yourself,
before buying something, "is this going to make my life noticeably
better?"<br><br>A friend of mine cured herself of a clothes buying habit by asking
herself before she bought anything "Am I going to wear this all the
time?"  If she couldn't convince herself that something she was
thinking of buying would become one of those few things she wore
all the time, she wouldn't buy it.  I think that would work for any
kind of purchase.  Before you buy anything, ask yourself: will this
be something I use constantly?  Or is it just something nice?  Or
worse still, a mere bargain?<br><br>The worst stuff in this respect may be stuff you don't use much
because it's too good.  Nothing owns you like fragile stuff.  For
example, the "good china" so many households have, and whose defining
quality is not so much that it's fun to use, but that one must be
especially careful not to break it.<br><br>Another way to resist acquiring stuff is to think of the overall
cost of owning it.  The purchase price is just the beginning.  You're
going to have to <i>think</i> about that thing for years—perhaps for
the rest of your life.  Every thing you own takes energy away from
you.  Some give more than they take.  Those are the only things
worth having.<br><br>I've now stopped accumulating stuff.  Except books—but books are
different.  Books are more like a fluid than individual objects.
It's not especially inconvenient to own several thousand books,
whereas if you owned several thousand random possessions you'd be
a local celebrity.  But except for books, I now actively avoid
stuff.  If I want to spend money on some kind of treat, I'll take
<xa href="http://acadiaairtours.com/flights.html">services over 
<xa href="http://www.collectiblestoday.com/ct/product/prdid-1400328001.jsp" rel="nofollow">goods any day.<br><br>I'm not claiming this is because I've achieved some kind of zenlike
detachment from material things.  I'm talking about something more
mundane.  A historical change has taken place, and I've now realized
it.  Stuff used to be valuable, and now it's not.<br><br>In industrialized countries the same thing happened with food in
the middle of the twentieth century.  As food got cheaper (or we
got richer; they're indistinguishable), eating too much started to
be a bigger danger than eating too little.   We've now reached that
point with stuff.  For most people, rich or poor, stuff has become
a burden.<br><br>The good news is, if you're carrying a burden without knowing it,
your life could be better than you realize.  Imagine walking around
for years with five pound ankle weights, then suddenly having them
removed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

in his mind the way a mathematician holds a problem he's working
on.  Mathematicians don't answer questions by working them out on
paper the way schoolchildren are taught to.  They do more in their
heads: they try to understand a problem space well enough that they
can walk around it the way you can walk around the memory of the
house you grew up in.  At its best programming is the same.  You
hold the whole program in your head, and you can manipulate it at
will.<br><br>That's particularly valuable at the start of a project, because
initially the most important thing is to be able to change what
you're doing.  Not just to solve the problem in a different way,
but to change the problem you're solving.<br><br>Your code is your understanding of the problem you're exploring.
So it's only when you have your code in your head that you really
understand the problem.<br><br>It's not easy to get a program into your head.  If you leave a
project for a few months, it can take days to really understand it
again when you return to it.  Even when you're actively working on
a program it can take half an hour to load into your head when you
start work each day.  And that's in the best case.  Ordinary
programmers working in typical office conditions never enter this
mode.  Or to put it more dramatically, ordinary programmers working
in typical office conditions never really understand the problems
they're solving.<br><br>Even the best programmers don't always have the whole program they're
working on loaded into their heads.   But there are things you can
do to help:<br><br><ol>
<li> <b>Avoid distractions.</b>  Distractions are bad for many types of work,
   but especially bad for programming, because programmers tend to
   operate at the limit of the detail they can handle.<br><br>The danger of a distraction depends not on how long it is, but
   on how much it scrambles your brain.  A programmer can leave the
   office and go and get a sandwich without losing the code in his
   head.  But the wrong kind of interruption can wipe your brain
   in 30 seconds.<br><br>Oddly enough, scheduled distractions may be worse than unscheduled
   ones.  If you know you have a meeting in an hour, you don't even
   start working on something hard.<br><br></li><li> <b>Work in long stretches.</b>  Since there's a fixed cost each time
   you start working on a program, it's more efficient to work in
   a few long sessions than many short ones.  There will of course
   come a point where you get stupid because you're tired.  This
   varies from person to person.  I've heard of people hacking for
   36 hours straight, but the most I've ever been able to manage
   is about 18, and I work best in chunks of no more than 12.<br><br>The optimum is not the limit you can physically endure.  There's
   an advantage as well as a cost of breaking up a project.  Sometimes
   when you return to a problem after a rest, you find your unconscious
   mind has left an answer waiting for you.<br><br></li><li> <b>Use succinct languages.</b>  More 
   <a href="power.html">powerful</a> programming languages
   make programs shorter. And programmers seem to think of programs
   at least partially in the language they're using to write them.
   The more succinct the language, the shorter the program, and the
   easier it is to load and keep in your head.<br><br>You can magnify the effect of a powerful language by using a
   style called bottom-up programming, where you write programs in
   multiple layers, the lower ones acting as programming languages
   for those above.  If you do this right, you only have to keep
   the topmost layer in your head.<br><br></li><li> <b>Keep rewriting your program.</b>  Rewriting a program often yields
   a cleaner design.  But it would have advantages even if it didn't:
   you have to understand a program completely to rewrite it, so
   there is no better way to get one loaded into your head.<br><br></li><li> <b>Write rereadable code.</b>  All programmers know it's good to write
   readable code.  But you yourself are the most important reader.
   Especially in the beginning; a prototype is a conversation with
   yourself.  And when writing for yourself you have different
   priorities.  If you're writing for other people, you may not
   want to make code too dense.  Some parts of a program may be
   easiest to read if you spread things out, like an introductory 
   textbook.  Whereas if you're writing code to make it easy to reload 
   into your head, it may be best to go for brevity.<br><br></li><li> <b>Work in small groups.</b>  When you manipulate a program in your
   head, your vision tends to stop at the edge of the code you own.
   Other parts you don't understand as well, and more importantly,
   can't take liberties with.  So the smaller the number of
   programmers, the more completely a project can mutate.  If there's
   just one programmer, as there often is at first, you can do
   all-encompassing redesigns.<br><br></li><li> <b>Don't have multiple people editing the same piece of code.</b>  You
   never understand other people's code as well as your own.  No
   matter how thoroughly you've read it, you've only read it, not
   written it.  So if a piece of code is written by multiple authors,
   none of them understand it as well as a single author would.<br><br>And of course you can't safely redesign something other people
   are working on.  It's not just that you'd have to ask permission.
   You don't even let yourself think of such things.  Redesigning
   code with several authors is like changing laws; redesigning
   code you alone control is like seeing the other interpretation
   of an ambiguous image.<br><br>If you want to put several people to work on a project, divide
   it into components and give each to one person.<br><br></li><li> <b>Start small.</b>  A program gets easier to hold in your head as you
   become familiar with it.  You can start to treat parts as black
   boxes once you feel confident you've fully explored them.  But
   when you first start working on a project, you're forced to see
   everything.  If you start with too big a problem, you may never
   quite be able to encompass it.  So if you need to write a big,
   complex program, the best way to begin may not be to write a
   spec for it, but to write a prototype that solves a subset of
   the problem.  Whatever the advantages of planning, they're often
   outweighed by the advantages of being able to keep a program in
   your head.
</li></ol>
It's striking how often programmers manage to hit all eight points
by accident.  Someone has an idea for a new project, but because
it's not officially sanctioned, he has to do it in off hours—which
turn out to be more productive because there are no distractions.
Driven by his enthusiasm for the new project he works on it for
many hours at a stretch.  Because it's initially just an
experiment, instead of a "production" language he uses a mere
"scripting" language—which is in fact far more powerful.  He
completely rewrites the program several times; that wouldn't be
justifiable for an official project, but this is a labor of love
and he wants it to be perfect.  And since no one is going to see
it except him, he omits any comments except the note-to-self variety.
He works in a small group perforce, because he either hasn't told
anyone else about the idea yet, or it seems so unpromising that no
one else is allowed to work on it.  Even if there is a group, they
couldn't have multiple people editing the same code, because it
changes too fast for that to be possible.  And the project starts
small because the idea <i>is</i> small at first; he just has some cool
hack he wants to try out.<br><br>Even more striking are the number of officially sanctioned projects
that manage to do <i>all eight things wrong</i>.  In fact, if you look at
the way software gets written in most organizations, it's almost
as if they were deliberately trying to do things wrong. In a sense,
they are.  One of the defining qualities of organizations since
there have been such a thing is to treat individuals as interchangeable
parts.  This works well for more parallelizable tasks, like fighting
wars.  For most of history a well-drilled army of professional
soldiers could be counted on to beat an army of individual warriors,
no matter how valorous.  But having ideas is not very parallelizable.
And that's what programs are: ideas.<br><br>It's not merely true that organizations dislike the idea of depending
on individual genius, it's a tautology.  It's part of the definition
of an organization not to.  Of our current concept of an organization,
at least.<br><br>Maybe we could define a new kind of organization that combined the
efforts of individuals without requiring them to be interchangeable.
Arguably a market is such a form of organization, though it may be
more accurate to describe a market as a degenerate case—as what
you get by default when organization isn't possible.<br><br>Probably the best we'll do is some kind of hack, like making the
programming parts of an organization work differently from the rest.
Perhaps the optimal solution is for big companies not even to try
to develop ideas in house, but simply to 
<a href="hiring.html">buy</a> them.  But regardless
of what the solution turns out to be, the first step is to realize
there's a problem.  There is a contradiction in the very phrase
"software company."   The two words are pulling in opposite directions.
Any good programmer in a large organization is going to be at odds
with it, because organizations are designed to prevent what
programmers strive for.<br><br><xa href="gh.html">Good programmers manage to get a lot done anyway.  
But often it
requires practically an act of rebellion against the organizations
that employ them.  Perhaps it will help if more people understand that the way
programmers behave is driven by the demands of the work they do.
It's not because they're irresponsible that they work in long binges
during which they blow off all other obligations, plunge straight into
programming instead of writing specs first, and rewrite code that
already works.  It's not because they're unfriendly that they prefer
to work alone, or growl at people who pop their head in the door
to say hello.  This apparently random collection of annoying habits
has a single explanation: the power of holding a program in one's
head.<br><br>Whether or not understanding this can help large organizations, it
can certainly help their competitors.  The weakest point in big
companies is that they don't let individual programmers do great
work.  So if you're a little startup, this is the place to attack
them.  Take on the kind of problems that have to be solved in one
big brain.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
August 2007<br><br><i>(This is a talk I gave at the last 
Y Combinator dinner of the summer. 
Usually we don't have a speaker at the last dinner; it's more of
a party.  But it seemed worth spoiling the atmosphere if I could
save some of the startups from
preventable deaths.  So at the last minute I cooked up this rather
grim talk.  I didn't mean this as an essay; I wrote it down
because I only had two hours before dinner and think fastest while
writing.)
</i><br><br>A couple days ago I told a reporter that we expected about a third
of the companies we funded to succeed.  Actually I was being
conservative.  I'm hoping it might be as much as a half.  Wouldn't
it be amazing if we could achieve a 50% success rate?<br><br>Another way of saying that is that half of you are going to die.  Phrased
that way, it doesn't sound good at all.  In fact, it's kind of weird
when you think about it, because our definition of success is that
the founders get rich.  If half the startups we fund succeed, then
half of you are going to get rich and the other half are going to
get nothing.<br><br>If you can just avoid dying, you get rich.  That sounds like a joke,
but it's actually a pretty good description of what happens in a
typical startup.  It certainly describes what happened in Viaweb.
We avoided dying till we got rich.<br><br>It was really close, too.  When we were visiting Yahoo to talk about
being acquired, we had to interrupt everything and borrow one of
their conference rooms to talk down an investor who was about to
back out of a new funding round we needed to stay alive.   So even
in the middle of getting rich we were fighting off the grim reaper.<br><br>You may have heard that quote about luck consisting of opportunity
meeting preparation.  You've now done the preparation.  The work
you've done so far has, in effect, put you in a position to get
lucky: you can now get rich by not letting your company die.  That's
more than most people have.  So let's talk about how not to die.<br><br>We've done this five times now, and we've seen a bunch of startups
die.  About 10 of them so far.  We don't know exactly what happens
when they die, because they generally don't die loudly and heroically.
Mostly they crawl off somewhere and die.<br><br>For us the main indication of impending doom is when we don't hear
from you.  When we haven't heard from, or about, a startup for a
couple months, that's a bad sign.  If we send them an email asking
what's up, and they don't reply, that's a really bad sign.  So far
that is a 100% accurate predictor of death.<br><br>Whereas if a startup regularly does new deals and releases and
either sends us mail or shows up at YC events, they're probably
going to live.<br><br>I realize this will sound naive, but maybe the linkage works in
both directions.  Maybe if you can arrange that we keep hearing
from you, you won't die.<br><br>That may not be so naive as it sounds.  You've probably noticed
that having dinners every Tuesday with us and the other founders
causes you to get more done than you would otherwise, because every
dinner is a mini Demo Day.  Every dinner is a kind of a deadline.
So the mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us will
push you to make things happen, because otherwise you'll be embarrassed
to tell us that you haven't done anything new since the last time
we talked.<br><br>If this works, it would be an amazing hack.  It would be pretty
cool if merely by staying in regular contact with us you could get
rich.  It sounds crazy, but there's a good chance that would work.<br><br>A variant is to stay in touch with other YC-funded startups.  There
is now a whole neighborhood of them in San Francisco.  If you move
there, the peer pressure that made you work harder all summer will
continue to operate.<br><br>When startups die, the official cause of death is always either
running out of money or a critical founder bailing.  Often the two
occur simultaneously.  But I think the underlying cause is usually
that they've become demoralized.  You rarely hear of a startup
that's working around the clock doing deals and pumping out new
features, and dies because they can't pay their bills and their ISP
unplugs their server.<br><br>Startups rarely die in mid keystroke.  So keep typing!<br><br>If so many startups get demoralized and fail when merely by hanging
on they could get rich, you have to assume that running a startup
can be demoralizing.  That is certainly true.  I've been there, and
that's why I've never done another startup.  The low points in a
startup are just unbelievably low.  I bet even Google had moments
where things seemed hopeless.<br><br>Knowing that should help.  If you know it's going to feel terrible
sometimes, then when it feels terrible you won't think "ouch, this
feels terrible, I give up."  It feels that way for everyone.  And
if you just hang on, things will probably get better.  The metaphor
people use to describe the way a startup feels is at least a roller
coaster and not drowning.  You don't just sink and sink; there are
ups after the downs.<br><br>Another feeling that seems alarming but is in fact normal in a
startup is the feeling that what you're doing isn't working.  The
reason you can expect to feel this is that what you do probably
won't work.  Startups almost never get it right the first time.
Much more commonly you launch something, and no one cares.  Don't
assume when this happens that you've failed.  That's normal for
startups.  But don't sit around doing nothing.  Iterate.<br><br>I like Paul Buchheit's suggestion of trying to make something that
at least someone really loves.  As long as you've made something
that a few users are ecstatic about, you're on the right track.  It
will be good for your morale to have even a handful of users who
really love you, and startups run on morale.  But also it
will tell you what to focus on.  What is it about you that they
love?  Can you do more of that?  Where can you find more people who
love that sort of thing?  As long as you have some core of users
who love you, all you have to do is expand it.  It may take a while,
but as long as you keep plugging away, you'll win in the end.  Both
Blogger and Delicious did that.  Both took years to succeed.  But
both began with a core of fanatically devoted users, and all Evan
and Joshua had to do was grow that core incrementally.  
<a href="http://wufoo.com">Wufoo</a> is
on the same trajectory now.<br><br>So when you release something and it seems like no one cares, look
more closely.  Are there zero users who really love you, or is there
at least some little group that does?  It's quite possible there
will be zero.  In that case, tweak your product and try again.
Every one of you is working on a space that contains at least one
winning permutation somewhere in it.  If you just keep trying,
you'll find it.<br><br>Let me mention some things not to do.  The number one thing not to
do is other things.  If you find yourself saying a sentence that
ends with "but we're going to keep working on the startup," you are
in big trouble.  Bob's going to grad school, but we're going to
keep working on the startup.  We're moving back to Minnesota, but
we're going to keep working on the startup.  We're taking on some
consulting projects, but we're going to keep working on the startup.
You may as well just translate these to "we're giving up on the
startup, but we're not willing to admit that to ourselves," because
that's what it means most of the time.  A startup is so hard that
working on it can't be preceded by "but."<br><br>In particular, don't go to graduate school, and don't start other
projects.  Distraction is fatal to startups.  Going to (or back to)
school is a huge predictor of death because in addition to the
distraction it gives you something to say you're doing.  If you're
only doing a startup, then if the startup fails, you fail.  If
you're in grad school and your startup fails, you can say later "Oh
yeah, we had this startup on the side when I was in grad school,
but it didn't go anywhere."<br><br>You can't use euphemisms like "didn't go anywhere" for something
that's your only occupation.  People won't let you.<br><br>One of the most interesting things we've discovered from working
on Y Combinator is that founders are more motivated by the fear of
looking bad than by the hope of getting millions of dollars.   So
if you want to get millions of dollars, put yourself in a position
where failure will be public and humiliating.<br><br>When we first met the founders of 
<a href="http://octopart.com">Octopart</a>, they seemed very smart,
but not a great bet to succeed, because they didn't seem especially
committed.  One of the two founders was still in grad school.  It
was the usual story: he'd drop out if it looked like the startup
was taking off.  Since then he has not only dropped out of grad
school, but appeared full length in 
<a href="http://docs.octopart.com/newsweek_octopart_small.jpg">Newsweek</a> 
with the word "Billionaire"
printed across his chest.  He just cannot fail now.  Everyone he
knows has seen that picture.  Girls who dissed him in high school
have seen it.  His mom probably has it on the fridge.  It would be
unthinkably humiliating to fail now.  At this point he is committed
to fight to the death.<br><br>I wish every startup we funded could appear in a Newsweek article
describing them as the next generation of billionaires, because
then none of them would be able to give up.  The success rate would
be 90%.  I'm not kidding.<br><br>When we first knew the Octoparts they were lighthearted, cheery
guys.  Now when we talk to them they seem grimly determined.  The
electronic parts distributors are trying to squash them to keep
their monopoly pricing.  (If it strikes you as odd that people still
order electronic parts out of thick paper catalogs in 2007, there's
a reason for that.  The distributors want to prevent the transparency
that comes from having prices online.)  I feel kind of bad that
we've transformed these guys from lighthearted to grimly determined.
But that comes with the territory.  If a startup succeeds, you get
millions of dollars, and you don't get that kind of money just by
asking for it.  You have to assume it takes some amount of pain.<br><br>And however tough things get for the Octoparts, I predict they'll
succeed.  They may have to morph themselves into something totally
different, but they won't just crawl off and die.  They're smart;
they're working in a promising field; and they just cannot give up.<br><br>All of you guys already have the first two.  You're all smart and
working on promising ideas.  Whether you end up among the living
or the dead comes down to the third ingredient, not giving up.<br><br>So I'll tell you now: bad shit is coming.  It always is in a startup.
The odds of getting from launch to liquidity without some kind of
disaster happening are one in a thousand.  So don't get demoralized.
When the disaster strikes, just say to yourself, ok, this was what
Paul was talking about.  What did he say to do?  Oh, yeah.  Don't
give up.<br><br></font></p></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/serious-2.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.aoky.net/articles/paul_graham/die.htm">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/serious-2.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://academy.hsoub.com/entrepreneurship/general/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%91%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%91%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%A6%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%9Fhow-not-to-die-r62/">Arabic Translation</a><br><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

me. It may not matter all that much where you go to college.<br><br>For me, as for a lot of middle class kids, getting into a good
college was more or less the meaning of life when I was growing up.
What was I?  A student.  To do that well meant to get good grades.
Why did one have to get good grades?  To get into a good college.
And why did one want to do that?  There seemed to be several reasons:
you'd learn more, get better jobs, make more money.  But it didn't
matter exactly what the benefits would be.  College was a bottleneck
through which all your future prospects passed; everything would
be better if you went to a better college.<br><br>A few weeks ago I realized that somewhere along the line I had
stopped believing that.<br><br>What first set me thinking about this was the new trend of worrying
obsessively about what 
<a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/urban/education/features/15141/">kindergarten</a>
your kids go to.  It seemed to
me this couldn't possibly matter.  Either it won't help your kid
get into Harvard, or if it does, getting into Harvard won't mean
much anymore.  And then I thought: how much does it mean even now?<br><br>It turns out I have a lot of data about that.  My three partners
and I run a seed stage investment firm called 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>.  We
invest when the company is just a couple guys and an idea.  The
idea doesn't matter much; it will change anyway.  Most of our
decision is based on the founders.  The average founder is three
years out of college.  Many have just graduated; a few are still
in school.  So we're in much the same position as a graduate program,
or a company hiring people right out of college.  Except our choices
are immediately and visibly tested.  There are two possible outcomes
for a startup: success or failure—and usually you know within a
year which it will be.<br><br>The test applied to a startup is among the purest of real world
tests.  A startup succeeds or fails depending almost entirely on
the efforts of the founders.  Success is decided by the market: you
only succeed if users like what you've built.  And users don't care
where you went to college.<br><br>As well as having precisely measurable results, we have a lot of
them.  Instead of doing a small number of large deals like a
traditional venture capital fund, we do a large number of small
ones.  We currently fund about 40 companies a year, selected from
about 900 applications representing a total of about 2000 people. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Between the volume of people we judge and the rapid, unequivocal
test that's applied to our choices, Y Combinator has been an
unprecedented opportunity for learning how to pick winners.  One
of the most surprising things we've learned is how little it matters
where people went to college.<br><br>I thought I'd already been cured of caring about that.  There's
nothing like going to grad school at Harvard to cure you of any
illusions you might have about the average Harvard undergrad.  And
yet Y Combinator showed us we were still overestimating people who'd
been to elite colleges.  We'd interview people from MIT or Harvard
or Stanford and sometimes find ourselves thinking: they <i>must</i> be
smarter than they seem.  It took us a few iterations to learn to
trust our senses.<br><br>Practically everyone thinks that someone who went to MIT or Harvard
or Stanford must be smart.  Even people who hate you for it believe
it.<br><br>But when you think about what it means to have gone to an elite
college, how could this be true?   We're talking about a decision
made by admissions officers—basically, HR people—based on a
cursory examination of a huge pile of depressingly similar applications
submitted by seventeen year olds.  And what do they have to go on?
An easily gamed standardized test; a short essay telling you what
the kid thinks you want to hear; an interview with a random alum;
a high school record that's largely an index of obedience.  Who
would rely on such a test?<br><br>And yet a lot of companies do.  A lot of companies are very much
influenced by where applicants went to college.  How could they be?
I think I know the answer to that.<br><br>There used to be a saying in the corporate world: "No one ever got
fired for buying IBM."  You no longer hear this about IBM specifically,
but the idea is very much alive; there is a whole category of
"enterprise" software companies that exist to take advantage of it.
People buying technology for large organizations don't care if they
pay a fortune for mediocre software.  It's not their money.  They
just want to buy from a supplier who seems safe—a company with
an established name, confident salesmen, impressive offices, and
software that conforms to all the current fashions.  Not necessarily
a company that will deliver so much as one that, if they do let you
down, will still seem to have been a prudent choice.  So companies
have evolved to fill that niche.<br><br>A recruiter at a big company is in much the same position as someone
buying technology for one.  If someone went to Stanford and is not
obviously insane, they're probably a safe bet.  And a safe bet is
enough.  No one ever measures recruiters by the later performance
of people they turn down. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>I'm not saying, of course, that elite colleges have evolved to prey
upon the weaknesses of large organizations the way enterprise
software companies have.  But they work as if they had.  In addition
to the power of the brand name, graduates of elite colleges have
two critical qualities that plug right into the way large organizations
work.  They're good at doing what they're asked, since that's what
it takes to please the adults who judge you at seventeen.  And
having been to an elite college makes them more confident.<br><br>Back in the days when people might spend their whole career at one
big company, these qualities must have been very valuable.  Graduates
of elite colleges would have been capable, yet amenable to authority.
And since individual performance is so hard to measure in large
organizations, their own confidence would have been the starting
point for their reputation.<br><br>Things are very different in the new world of startups.  We couldn't
save someone from the market's judgement even if we wanted to.  And
being charming and confident counts for nothing with users.  All
users care about is whether you make something they like.  If you
don't, you're dead.<br><br>Knowing that test is coming makes us work a lot harder to get the
right answers than anyone would if they were merely hiring people.
We can't afford to have any illusions about the predictors of
success.  And what we've found is that the variation between schools
is so much smaller than the variation between individuals that it's
negligible by comparison.  We can learn more about someone in the
first minute of talking to them than by knowing where they went to
school.<br><br>It seems obvious when you put it that way.  Look at the individual,
not where they went to college.  But that's a weaker statement than
the idea I began with, that it doesn't matter much where a given
individual goes to college.  Don't you learn things at the best
schools that you wouldn't learn at lesser places?<br><br>Apparently not.  Obviously you can't prove this in the case of a
single individual, but you can tell from aggregate evidence: you
can't, without asking them, distinguish people who went to one
school from those who went to another three times as far down the
<i>US News</i> list. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
Try it and see.<br><br>How can this be?  Because how much you learn in college depends a
lot more on you than the college.  A determined party animal can
get through the best school without learning anything.  And someone
with a real thirst for knowledge will be able to find a few smart
people to learn from at a school that isn't prestigious at all.<br><br>
The other students are the biggest advantage of going to an elite
college; you learn more from them than the professors.  But
you should be able to reproduce this at most colleges if you make
a conscious effort to find smart friends.  At
most colleges you can find at least a handful of other smart students,
and most people have only a handful of close friends in college
anyway. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
The odds of finding smart professors are even better.
The curve for faculty is a lot flatter than for students, especially
in math and the hard sciences; you have to go pretty far down the
list of colleges before you stop finding smart professors in the
math department.<br><br>So it's not surprising that we've found the relative prestige of
different colleges useless in judging individuals.  There's a lot
of randomness in how colleges select people, and what they learn
there depends much more on them than the college.  Between these
two sources of variation, the college someone went to doesn't mean
a lot.  It is to some degree a predictor of ability, but so weak
that we regard it mainly as a source of error and try consciously
to ignore it.<br><br>I doubt what we've discovered is an anomaly specific to startups.
Probably people have always overestimated the importance of where
one goes to college.  We're just finally able to measure it.<br><br>The unfortunate thing is not just that people are judged by such a
superficial test, but that so many judge themselves by it.  A lot
of people, probably the majority of people in America, have
some amount of insecurity about where, or whether, they went to
college.  The tragedy of the situation is that by far the greatest
liability of not having gone to the college you'd have liked is
your own feeling that you're thereby lacking something.  Colleges
are a bit like exclusive clubs in this respect.  There is only one
real advantage to being a member of most exclusive clubs: you know
you wouldn't be missing much if you weren't.  When you're excluded,
you can only imagine the advantages of being an insider.  But
invariably they're larger in your imagination than in real life.<br><br>So it is with colleges.  Colleges differ, but they're nothing like
the stamp of destiny so many imagine them to be.  People aren't
what some admissions officer decides about them at seventeen.
They're what they make themselves.<br><br>Indeed, the great advantage of not caring where people went to
college is not just that you can stop judging them (and yourself)
by superficial measures, but that you can focus instead on what
really matters.  What matters is what you make of yourself.  
I think that's what we
should tell kids.  Their job isn't to get good grades so they can
get into a good college, but to learn and do.  And not just because
that's more rewarding than worldly success.  That will increasingly
<i>be</i> the route to worldly success.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] 
Is what we measure worth measuring?  I think so.  You can get
rich simply by being energetic and unscrupulous, but getting rich
from a technology startup takes some amount of brains.   It is just
the kind of work the upper middle class values; it has about the
same intellectual component as being a doctor.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>] 
Actually, someone did, once.  Mitch Kapor's wife Freada was
in charge of HR at Lotus in the early years.  (As he is at pains
to point out, they did not become romantically involved till
afterward.)  At one point they worried Lotus was losing its startup
edge and turning into a big company.  So as an experiment she sent
their recruiters the resumes of the first 40 employees, with
identifying details changed.  These were the people who had made
Lotus into the star it was.  Not one got an interview.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>] 
The <i>US News</i> list?  Surely no one trusts that.  Even if the
statistics they consider are useful, how do they decide on the
relative weights?  The reason the <i>US News</i> list is meaningful is
precisely because they are so intellectually dishonest in that
respect.  There is no external source they can use to calibrate the
weighting of the statistics they use; if there were, we could just
use that instead.  What they must do is adjust the weights till the
top schools are the usual suspects in about the right order.  So
in effect what the <i>US News</i> list tells us is what the editors think
the top schools are, which is probably not far from the conventional
wisdom on the matter.  The amusing thing is, because some schools
work hard to game the system, the editors will have to keep tweaking
their algorithm to get the rankings they want.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>] 
Possible doesn't mean easy, of course.  A smart student at a party school
will inevitably be something of an outcast, just as he or
she would be in most <a href="nerds.html">high schools</a>.<br><br>

I had several motives, some more honorable than others.  One of the
less honorable was to shock people.  College was regarded as job
training where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively
impractical thing to do.  Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes
or putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other forms
of impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.<br><br>But I had some more honest motives as well.  I thought studying
philosophy would be a shortcut straight to wisdom.  All the people
majoring in other things would just end up with a bunch of domain
knowledge.  I would be learning what was really what.<br><br>I'd tried to read a few philosophy books.  Not recent ones; you
wouldn't find those in our high school library.  But I tried to
read Plato and Aristotle.  I doubt I believed I understood them,
but they sounded like they were talking about something important.
I assumed I'd learn what in college.<br><br>The summer before senior year I took some college classes.  I learned
a lot in the calculus class, but I didn't learn much in Philosophy
101.  And yet my plan to study philosophy remained intact.  It was
my fault I hadn't learned anything.  I hadn't read the books we
were assigned carefully enough.  I'd give Berkeley's <i>Principles
of Human Knowledge</i> another shot in college.  Anything so admired
and so difficult to read must have something in it, if one could
only figure out what.<br><br>Twenty-six years later, I still don't understand Berkeley.  I have
a nice edition of his collected works.  Will I ever read it?  Seems
unlikely.<br><br>The difference between then and now is that now I understand why
Berkeley is probably not worth trying to understand.  I think I see
now what went wrong with philosophy, and how we might fix it.<br><br><b>Words</b><br><br>I did end up being a philosophy major for most of college.  It
didn't work out as I'd hoped.  I didn't learn any magical truths
compared to which everything else was mere domain knowledge.  But
I do at least know now why I didn't.  Philosophy doesn't really
have a subject matter in the way math or history or most other
university subjects do.  There is no core of knowledge one must
master.  The closest you come to that is a knowledge of what various
individual philosophers have said about different topics over the
years.  Few were sufficiently correct that people have forgotten
who discovered what they discovered.<br><br>Formal logic has some subject matter. I took several classes in
logic.  I don't know if I learned anything from them.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
It does seem to me very important to be able to flip ideas around in
one's head: to see when two ideas don't fully cover the space of
possibilities, or when one idea is the same as another but with a
couple things changed.  But did studying logic teach me the importance
of thinking this way, or make me any better at it?  I don't know.<br><br>There are things I know I learned from studying philosophy.  The
most dramatic I learned immediately, in the first semester of
freshman year, in a class taught by Sydney Shoemaker.  I learned
that I don't exist.  I am (and you are) a collection of cells that
lurches around driven by various forces, and calls itself <i>I</i>.  But
there's no central, indivisible thing that your identity goes with.
You could conceivably lose half your brain and live.  Which means
your brain could conceivably be split into two halves and each
transplanted into different bodies.  Imagine waking up after such
an operation.  You have to imagine being two people.<br><br>The real lesson here is that the concepts we use in everyday life
are fuzzy, and break down if pushed too hard.  Even a concept as
dear to us as <i>I</i>.  It took me a while to grasp this, but when I
did it was fairly sudden, like someone in the nineteenth century
grasping evolution and realizing the story of creation they'd been
told as a child was all wrong. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Outside of math there's a limit
to how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad
definition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise
meanings.  Everyday words are inherently imprecise.  They work well
enough in everyday life that you don't notice.  Words seem to work,
just as Newtonian physics seems to.  But you can always make them
break if you push them far enough.<br><br>I would say that this has been, unfortunately for philosophy, the
central fact of philosophy.  Most philosophical debates are not
merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words.  Do we
have free will?  Depends what you mean by "free." Do abstract ideas
exist?  Depends what you mean by "exist."<br><br>Wittgenstein is popularly credited with the idea that most philosophical
controversies are due to confusions over language.  I'm not sure
how much credit to give him.  I suspect a lot of people realized
this, but reacted simply by not studying philosophy, rather than
becoming philosophy professors.<br><br>How did things get this way?  Can something people have spent
thousands of years studying really be a waste of time?  Those are
interesting questions.  In fact, some of the most interesting
questions you can ask about philosophy.  The most valuable way to
approach the current philosophical tradition may be neither to get
lost in pointless speculations like Berkeley, nor to shut them down
like Wittgenstein, but to study it as an example of reason gone
wrong.<br><br><b>History</b><br><br>Western philosophy really begins with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.
What we know of their predecessors comes from fragments and references
in later works; their doctrines could be described as speculative
cosmology that occasionally strays into analysis.  Presumably they
were driven by whatever makes people in every other society invent
cosmologies.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>With Socrates, Plato, and particularly Aristotle, this tradition
turned a corner.  There started to be a lot more analysis.  I suspect
Plato and Aristotle were encouraged in this by progress in math.
Mathematicians had by then shown that you could figure things out
in a much more conclusive way than by making up fine sounding stories
about them.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>People talk so much about abstractions now that we don't realize
what a leap it must have been when they first started to.  It was
presumably many thousands of years between when people first started
describing things as hot or cold and when someone asked "what is
heat?"  No doubt it was a very gradual process.  We don't know if
Plato or Aristotle were the first to ask any of the questions they
did.  But their works are the oldest we have that do this on a large
scale, and there is a freshness (not to say naivete) about them
that suggests some of the questions they asked were new to them,
at least.<br><br>Aristotle in particular reminds me of the phenomenon that happens
when people discover something new, and are so excited by it that
they race through a huge percentage of the newly discovered territory
in one lifetime.  If so, that's evidence of how new this kind of
thinking was. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>This is all to explain how Plato and Aristotle can be very impressive
and yet naive and mistaken.  It was impressive even to ask the
questions they did.  That doesn't mean they always came up with
good answers.  It's not considered insulting to say that ancient
Greek mathematicians were naive in some respects, or at least lacked
some concepts that would have made their lives easier.  So I hope
people will not be too offended if I propose that ancient philosophers
were similarly naive.  In particular, they don't seem to have fully
grasped what I earlier called the central fact of philosophy: that
words break if you push them too far.<br><br>"Much to the surprise of the builders of the first digital computers,"
Rod Brooks wrote, "programs written for them usually did not work."
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font>
Something similar happened when people first started trying
to talk about abstractions.  Much to their surprise, they didn't
arrive at answers they agreed upon.  In fact, they rarely seemed
to arrive at answers at all.<br><br>They were in effect arguing about artifacts induced by sampling at
too low a resolution.<br><br>The proof of how useless some of their answers turned out to be is
how little effect they have.  No one after reading Aristotle's
<i>Metaphysics</i> does anything differently as a result.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Surely I'm not claiming that ideas have to have practical applications
to be interesting?  No, they may not have to.  Hardy's boast that
number theory had no use whatsoever wouldn't disqualify it.  But
he turned out to be mistaken.  In fact, it's suspiciously hard to
find a field of math that truly has no practical use.  And Aristotle's
explanation of the ultimate goal of philosophy in Book A of the
<i>Metaphysics</i> implies that philosophy should be useful too.<br><br><b>Theoretical Knowledge</b><br><br>Aristotle's goal was to find the most general of general principles.
The examples he gives are convincing: an ordinary worker builds
things a certain way out of habit; a master craftsman can do more
because he grasps the underlying principles.  The trend is clear:
the more general the knowledge, the more admirable it is.  But then
he makes a mistake—possibly the most important mistake in the
history of philosophy.  He has noticed that theoretical knowledge
is often acquired for its own sake, out of curiosity, rather than
for any practical need.  So he proposes there are two kinds of
theoretical knowledge: some that's useful in practical matters and
some that isn't.  Since people interested in the latter are interested
in it for its own sake, it must be more noble.  So he sets as his
goal in the <i>Metaphysics</i> the exploration of knowledge that has no
practical use.  Which means no alarms go off when he takes on grand
but vaguely understood questions and ends up getting lost in a sea
of words.<br><br>His mistake was to confuse motive and result.  Certainly, people
who want a deep understanding of something are often driven by
curiosity rather than any practical need.  But that doesn't mean
what they end up learning is useless.  It's very valuable in practice
to have a deep understanding of what you're doing; even if you're
never called on to solve advanced problems, you can see shortcuts
in the solution of simple ones, and your knowledge won't break down
in edge cases, as it would if you were relying on formulas you
didn't understand.  Knowledge is power.  That's what makes theoretical
knowledge prestigious.  It's also what causes smart people to be
curious about certain things and not others; our DNA is not so
disinterested as we might think.<br><br>So while ideas don't have to have immediate practical applications
to be interesting, the kinds of things we find interesting will
surprisingly often turn out to have practical applications.<br><br>The reason Aristotle didn't get anywhere in the <i>Metaphysics</i> was
partly that he set off with contradictory aims: to explore the most
abstract ideas, guided by the assumption that they were useless.
He was like an explorer looking for a territory to the north of
him, starting with the assumption that it was located to the south.<br><br>And since his work became the map used by generations of future
explorers, he sent them off in the wrong direction as well. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font>
Perhaps worst of all, he protected them from both the criticism of
outsiders and the promptings of their own inner compass by establishing
the principle that the most noble sort of theoretical knowledge had
to be useless.<br><br>The <i>Metaphysics</i> is mostly a failed experiment.  A few ideas from
it turned out to be worth keeping; the bulk of it has had no effect
at all.  The <i>Metaphysics</i> is among the least read of all famous
books.  It's not hard to understand the way Newton's <i>Principia</i>
is, but the way a garbled message is.<br><br>Arguably it's an interesting failed experiment.  But unfortunately
that was not the conclusion Aristotle's successors derived from
works like the <i>Metaphysics</i>. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font>
Soon after, the western world
fell on intellectual hard times.  Instead of version 1s to be
superseded, the works of Plato and Aristotle became revered texts
to be mastered and discussed.  And so things remained for a shockingly
long time.  It was not till around 1600 (in Europe, where the center
of gravity had shifted by then) that one found people confident
enough to treat Aristotle's work as a catalog of mistakes.  And
even then they rarely said so outright.<br><br>If it seems surprising that the gap was so long, consider how little
progress there was in math between Hellenistic times and the
Renaissance.<br><br>In the intervening years an unfortunate idea took hold:  that it
was not only acceptable to produce works like the <i>Metaphysics</i>,
but that it was a particularly prestigious line of work, done by a
class of people called philosophers.  No one thought to go back and
debug Aristotle's motivating argument.  And so instead of correcting
the problem Aristotle discovered by falling into it—that you can
easily get lost if you talk too loosely about very abstract ideas—they 
continued to fall into it.<br><br><b>The Singularity</b><br><br>Curiously, however, the works they produced continued to attract
new readers.  Traditional philosophy occupies a kind of singularity
in this respect.  If you write in an unclear way about big ideas,
you produce something that seems tantalizingly attractive to
inexperienced but intellectually ambitious students.  Till one knows
better, it's hard to distinguish something that's hard to understand
because the writer was unclear in his own mind from something like
a mathematical proof that's hard to understand because the ideas
it represents are hard to understand.  To someone who hasn't learned
the difference, traditional philosophy seems extremely attractive:
as hard (and therefore impressive) as math, yet broader in scope.
That was what lured me in as a high school student.<br><br>This singularity is even more singular in having its own defense
built in.  When things are hard to understand, people who suspect
they're nonsense generally keep quiet.  There's no way to prove a
text is meaningless.  The closest you can get is to show that the
official judges of some class of texts can't distinguish them from
placebos. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>And so instead of denouncing philosophy, most people who suspected
it was a waste of time just studied other things.  That alone is
fairly damning evidence, considering philosophy's claims.  It's
supposed to be about the ultimate truths. Surely all smart people
would be interested in it, if it delivered on that promise.<br><br>Because philosophy's flaws turned away the sort of people who might
have corrected them, they tended to be self-perpetuating.  Bertrand
Russell wrote in a letter in 1912:
<blockquote>
  Hitherto the people attracted to philosophy have been mostly those
  who loved the big generalizations, which were all wrong, so that
  few people with exact minds have taken up the subject.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
His response was to launch Wittgenstein at it, with dramatic results.<br><br>I think Wittgenstein deserves to be famous not for the discovery
that most previous philosophy was a waste of time, which judging
from the circumstantial evidence must have been made by every smart
person who studied a little philosophy and declined to pursue it
further, but for how he acted in response.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font>
Instead of quietly
switching to another field, he made a fuss, from inside.  He was
Gorbachev.<br><br>The field of philosophy is still shaken from the fright Wittgenstein
gave it. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font>
Later in life he spent a lot of time talking about
how words worked.  Since that seems to be allowed, that's what a
lot of philosophers do now.  Meanwhile, sensing a vacuum in the
metaphysical speculation department, the people who used to do
literary criticism have been edging Kantward, under new names like
"literary theory," "critical theory," and when they're feeling
ambitious, plain "theory."  The writing is the familiar word salad:
<blockquote>
  Gender is not like some of the other grammatical modes which
  express precisely a mode of conception without any reality that
  corresponds to the conceptual mode, and consequently do not express
  precisely something in reality by which the intellect could be
  moved to conceive a thing the way it does, even where that motive
  is not something in the thing as such.
  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#999999">14</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
The singularity I've described is not going away.  There's a market
for writing that sounds impressive and can't be disproven. There
will always be both supply and demand.  So if one group abandons
this territory, there will always be others ready to occupy it.<br><br><b>A Proposal</b><br><br>We may be able to do better.  Here's an intriguing possibility.
Perhaps we should do what Aristotle meant to do, instead of what
he did.  The goal he announces in the <i>Metaphysics</i> seems one worth
pursuing: to discover the most general truths.  That sounds good.
But instead of trying to discover them because they're useless,
let's try to discover them because they're useful.<br><br>I propose we try again, but that we use that heretofore despised
criterion, applicability, as a guide to keep us from wondering
off into a swamp of abstractions.  Instead of trying to answer the
question:
<blockquote>
  What are the most general truths?
</blockquote>
let's try to answer the question
<blockquote>
  Of all the useful things we can say, which are the most general?
</blockquote>
The test of utility I propose is whether we cause people who read
what we've written to do anything differently afterward.  Knowing
we have to give definite (if implicit) advice will keep us from
straying beyond the resolution of the words we're using.<br><br>The goal is the same as Aristotle's; we just approach it from a
different direction.<br><br>As an example of a useful, general idea, consider that of the
controlled experiment.  There's an idea that has turned out to be
widely applicable.  Some might say it's part of science, but it's
not part of any specific science; it's literally meta-physics (in
our sense of "meta").   The idea of evolution is another. It turns
out to have quite broad applications—for example, in genetic
algorithms and even product design.  Frankfurt's distinction between
lying and bullshitting seems a promising recent example.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#999999">15</font></a>]</font><br><br>These seem to me what philosophy should look like: quite general
observations that would cause someone who understood them to do
something differently.<br><br>Such observations will necessarily be about things that are imprecisely
defined.  Once you start using words with precise meanings, you're
doing math.  So starting from utility won't entirely solve the
problem I described above—it won't flush out the metaphysical
singularity.  But it should help.  It gives people with good
intentions a new roadmap into abstraction.  And they may thereby
produce things that make the writing of the people with bad intentions
look bad by comparison.<br><br>One drawback of this approach is that it won't produce the sort of
writing that gets you tenure.  And not just because it's not currently
the fashion.  In order to get tenure in any field you must not
arrive at conclusions that members of tenure committees can disagree
with.  In practice there are two kinds of solutions to this problem.
In math and the sciences, you can prove what you're saying, or at
any rate adjust your conclusions so you're not claiming anything
false ("6 of 8 subjects had lower blood pressure after the treatment").
In the humanities you can either avoid drawing any definite conclusions
(e.g. conclude that an issue is a complex one), or draw conclusions
so narrow that no one cares enough to disagree with you.<br><br>The kind of philosophy I'm advocating won't be able to take either
of these routes.  At best you'll be able to achieve the essayist's
standard of proof, not the mathematician's or the experimentalist's.
And yet you won't be able to meet the usefulness test without
implying definite and fairly broadly applicable conclusions.  Worse
still, the usefulness test will tend to produce results that annoy
people: there's no use in telling people things they already believe,
and people are often upset to be told things they don't.<br><br>Here's the exciting thing, though.  Anyone can do this.  Getting
to general plus useful by starting with useful and cranking up the
generality may be unsuitable for junior professors trying to get
tenure, but it's better for everyone else, including professors who
already have it.  This side of the mountain is a nice gradual slope.
You can start by writing things that are useful but very specific,
and then gradually make them more general.  Joe's has good burritos.
What makes a good burrito?  What makes good food?  What makes
anything good?  You can take as long as you want.  You don't have
to get all the way to the top of the mountain.  You don't have to
tell anyone you're doing philosophy.<br><br>If it seems like a daunting task to do philosophy, here's an
encouraging thought.  The field is a lot younger than it seems.
Though the first philosophers in the western tradition lived about
2500 years ago, it would be misleading to say the field is 2500
years old, because for most of that time the leading practitioners
weren't doing much more than writing commentaries on Plato or
Aristotle while watching over their shoulders for the next invading
army.  In the times when they weren't, philosophy was hopelessly
intermingled with religion.  It didn't shake itself free till a
couple hundred years ago, and even then was afflicted by the
structural problems I've described above.  If I say this, some will
say it's a ridiculously overbroad and uncharitable generalization,
and others will say it's old news, but here goes: judging from their
works, most philosophers up to the present have been wasting their
time.  So in a sense the field is still at the first step. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#999999">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>That sounds a preposterous claim to make.  It won't seem so
preposterous in 10,000 years.  Civilization always seems old, because
it's always the oldest it's ever been.  The only way to say whether
something is really old or not is by looking at structural evidence,
and structurally philosophy is young; it's still reeling from the
unexpected breakdown of words.<br><br>Philosophy is as young now as math was in 1500.  There is a lot
more to discover.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br><!-- (Sorry there are so many notes.  This is a topic with many branches,

In practice formal logic is not much use, because despite
some progress in the last 150 years we're still only able to formalize
a small percentage of statements.  We may never do that much better,
for the same reason 1980s-style "knowledge representation" could
never have worked; many statements may have no representation more
concise than a huge, analog brain state.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
It was harder for Darwin's contemporaries to grasp this than
we can easily imagine.  The story of creation in the Bible is not
just a Judeo-Christian concept; it's roughly what everyone must
have believed since before people were people.  The hard part of
grasping evolution was to realize that species weren't, as they
seem to be, unchanging, but had instead evolved from different,
simpler organisms over unimaginably long periods of time.<br><br>Now we don't have to make that leap.  No one in an industrialized
country encounters the idea of evolution for the first time as an
adult.  Everyone's taught about it as a child, either as truth or
heresy.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Greek philosophers before Plato wrote in verse.  This must
have affected what they said.  If you try to write about the nature

Philosophy is like math's
ne'er-do-well brother.  It was born when Plato and Aristotle looked
at the works of their predecessors and said in effect "why can't
you be more like your brother?"  Russell was still saying the same
thing 2300 years later.<br><br>Math is the precise half of the most abstract ideas, and philosophy
the imprecise half.  It's probably inevitable that philosophy will
suffer by comparison, because there's no lower bound to its precision.
Bad math is merely boring, whereas bad philosophy is nonsense.  And
yet there are <i>some</i> good ideas in the imprecise half.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Aristotle's best work was in logic and zoology, both of which
he can  be said to have invented.  But the most dramatic departure
from his predecessors was a new, much more analytical style of
thinking.  He was arguably the first scientist.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]

Some would say we depend on Aristotle more than we realize,
because his ideas were one of the ingredients in our common culture.
Certainly a lot of the words we use have a connection with Aristotle,
but it seems a bit much to suggest that we wouldn't have the concept
of the essence of something or the distinction between matter and

The meaning of the word "philosophy" has changed over time.
In ancient times it covered a broad range of topics, comparable in
scope to our "scholarship" (though without the methodological
implications).  Even as late as Newton's time it included what we
now call "science."  But core of the subject today is still what
seemed to Aristotle the core: the attempt to discover the most
general truths.<br><br>Aristotle didn't call this "metaphysics."  That name got assigned
to it because the books we now call the <i>Metaphysics</i> came after
(meta = after) the <i>Physics</i> in the standard edition of Aristotle's
works compiled by Andronicus of Rhodes three centuries later.  What
we call "metaphysics" Aristotle called "first philosophy."<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]

this, but it's hard to say because most of their works are lost.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]

vulnerable—perhaps partly because so many had been raised religious
and then stopped believing, so had a vacant space in their heads
for someone to tell them what to do (others chose Marx or Cardinal
Newman), and partly because a quiet, earnest place like Cambridge
in that era had no natural immunity to messianic figures, just as

Some introductions to philosophy now take the line that
philosophy is worth studying as a process rather than for any
particular truths you'll learn.  The philosophers whose works they
cover would be rolling in their graves at that.  They hoped they
were doing more than serving as examples of how to argue: they hoped
they were getting results.  Most were wrong, but it doesn't seem
an impossible hope.<br><br>This argument seems to me like someone in 1500 looking at the lack
of results achieved by alchemy and saying its value was as a process.
No, they were going about it wrong.  It turns out it is possible
to transmute lead into gold (though not economically at current
energy prices), but the route to that knowledge was to
backtrack and try another approach.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston,

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
October 2007<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a keynote at FOWA in October 2007.)</i><br><br>There's something interesting happening right now.  Startups are
undergoing the same transformation that technology does when it becomes
cheaper.<br><br>It's a pattern we see over and over in technology.  Initially
there's some device that's very expensive and made
in small quantities.  Then someone discovers how to make them cheaply; 
many more get built; and as a result they can be used in new ways.<br><br>Computers are a familiar example.  When I was a kid, computers were
big, expensive machines built one at a time.  Now they're a commodity.
Now we can stick computers in everything.<br><br>This pattern is very old.  Most of the turning
points in economic history are instances of it.  It happened to
steel in the 1850s, and to power in the 1780s.
It happened to cloth manufacture in the thirteenth century, generating
the wealth that later brought about the Renaissance.  Agriculture
itself was an instance of this pattern.<br><br>Now as well as being produced by startups, this pattern
is happening <i>to</i> startups.  It's so cheap to start web startups
that orders of magnitudes more will be started.   If the pattern
holds true, that should cause dramatic changes.<br><br><b>1. Lots of Startups</b><br><br>So my first prediction about the future of web startups is pretty
straightforward: there will be a lot of them.  When starting a
startup was expensive, you had to get the permission of investors
to do it.  Now the only threshold is courage.<br><br>Even that threshold is getting lower, as people watch others take
the plunge and survive.  In the last batch of startups we funded,
we had several founders who said they'd thought of applying before,
but weren't sure and got jobs instead.  It was only after hearing
reports of friends who'd done it that they decided to try it
themselves.<br><br>Starting a startup is hard, but having a 9 to 5 job is hard too,
and in some ways a worse kind of hard.  In a startup you have lots
of worries, but you don't have that feeling that your life is flying
by like you do in a big company.  Plus in a startup you could make
much more money.<br><br>As word spreads that startups work, the number may grow
to a point that would now seem surprising.<br><br>We now think of it as normal to have a job at a company, but this
is the thinnest of historical veneers.  Just two or three
lifetimes ago, most people in what are now called industrialized
countries lived by farming.  So while it may seem surprising to
propose that large numbers of people will change the way they make
a living, it would be more surprising if they didn't.<br><br><b>2. Standardization</b><br><br>When technology makes something dramatically cheaper, standardization
always follows.  When you make things in large volumes you tend
to standardize everything that doesn't need to change.<br><br>At Y Combinator we still only have four people, so we try to
standardize everything.  We could hire employees, but we want to be
forced to figure out how to scale investing.<br><br>We often tell startups to release a minimal version one quickly, 
then let the needs of the users determine what to do
next.  In essense, let the market design the product.  We've
done the same thing ourselves.  We think of the techniques we're
developing for dealing with large numbers of startups as like
software.  Sometimes it literally is software, like 
<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> and
our application system.<br><br>One of the most important things we've been working on standardizing
are investment terms.  Till now investment terms have been
individually negotiated.
This is a problem for founders, because it makes raising money
take longer and cost more in legal fees.  So as well as using the
same paperwork for every deal we do, we've commissioned generic
angel paperwork that all the startups we fund can use for future
rounds.<br><br>Some investors will still want to cook up their own deal terms.
Series A rounds, where you raise a million dollars or more, will
be custom deals for the forseeable future.  But I think angel rounds
will start to be done mostly with standardized agreements.  An angel
who wants to insert a bunch of complicated terms into the agreement
is probably not one you want anyway.<br><br><b>3. New Attitude to Acquisition</b><br><br>Another thing I see starting to get standardized is acquisitions.
As the volume of startups increases, big companies will start to
develop standardized procedures that make acquisitions little
more work than hiring someone.<br><br>Google is the leader here, as in so many areas of technology.  They
buy a lot of startups— more than most people realize, because they
only announce a fraction of them.   And being Google, they're
figuring out how to do it efficiently.<br><br>One problem they've solved is how to think about acquisitions.  For
most companies, acquisitions still carry some stigma of inadequacy.
Companies do them because they have to, but there's usually some
feeling they shouldn't have to—that their own programmers should
be able to build everything they need.<br><br>Google's example should cure the rest of the world of this idea.
Google has by far the best programmers of any public technology
company.  If they don't have a problem doing acquisitions, the
others should have even less problem.  However many Google does,
Microsoft should do ten times as many.<br><br>One reason Google doesn't have a problem with acquisitions
is that they know first-hand the quality of the people they can get
that way.  Larry and Sergey only started Google after making the
rounds of the search engines trying to sell their idea and finding
no takers.  They've <i>been</i> the guys coming in to visit the big
company, so they know who might be sitting across that conference
table from them.<br><br><b>4. Riskier Strategies are Possible</b><br><br>Risk is always proportionate to reward.  The way to get really big
returns is to do things that seem crazy, like starting a new search
engine in 1998, or turning down a billion dollar acquisition offer.<br><br>This has traditionally been a problem in venture funding.  Founders
and investors have different attitudes to risk.  Knowing that risk
is on average proportionate to reward, investors like risky strategies,
while founders, who don't have a big enough sample size to care
what's true on average, tend to be more conservative.<br><br>If startups are easy to start, this conflict goes away, because
founders can start them younger, when it's rational to take more
risk, and can start more startups total in their careers.  When
founders can do lots of startups, they can start to look at the
world in the same portfolio-optimizing way as investors.  And that
means the overall amount of wealth created can be greater, because
strategies can be riskier.<br><br><b>5. Younger, Nerdier Founders</b><br><br>If startups become a cheap commodity, more people will be able to
have them, just as more people could have computers once microprocessors
made them cheap.  And in particular, younger and more technical
founders will be able to start startups than could before.<br><br>Back when it cost a lot to start a startup, you had to convince
investors to let you do it.  And that required very different skills
from actually doing the startup.  If investors were perfect judges,
the two would require exactly the same skills.  But unfortunately
most investors are terrible judges.  I know because I see behind
the scenes what an enormous amount of work it takes to raise money,
and the amount of selling required in an industry is always inversely
proportional to the judgement of the buyers.<br><br>Fortunately, if startups get cheaper to start, there's another way
to convince investors.  Instead of going to venture capitalists
with a business plan and trying to convince them to fund it, you
can get a product launched on a few tens of thousands of dollars
of seed money from us or your uncle, and approach them with a
working company instead of a plan for one.  Then instead of
having to seem smooth and confident, you can just point them to
Alexa.<br><br>This way of convincing investors is better suited to hackers, who
often went into technology in part because they felt uncomfortable
with the amount of fakeness required in other fields.<br><br><b>6. Startup Hubs Will Persist</b><br><br>It might seem that if startups get cheap to start, it will mean the
end of startup hubs like Silicon Valley.  If all you need to start
a startup is rent money, you should be able to do it anywhere.<br><br>This is kind of true and kind of false.  It's true that you can now
<i>start</i> a startup anywhere.  But you have to do more with a
startup than just start it.  You have to make it succeed.  And that
is more likely to happen in a startup hub.<br><br>I've thought a lot about this question, and it seems to me the
increasing cheapness of web startups will if anything increase the
importance of startup hubs.  The value of startup hubs, like centers
for any kind of business, lies in something very old-fashioned:
face to face meetings.  No technology in the immediate future will
replace walking down University Ave and running into a friend who
tells you how to fix a bug that's been bothering you all weekend,
or visiting a friend's startup down the street and ending up in a
conversation with one of their investors.<br><br>The question of whether to be in a startup hub is like the question
of whether to take outside investment.  The question is not whether
you <i>need</i> it, but whether it brings any advantage at all.
Because anything that brings an advantage will give your competitors
an advantage over you if they do it and you don't.  So if you hear
someone saying "we don't need to be in Silicon Valley," that use
of the word "need" is a sign they're not even thinking about the
question right.<br><br>And while startup hubs are as powerful magnets as ever, the increasing
cheapness of starting a startup means the particles they're attracting
are getting lighter.  A startup now can be just a pair of 22 year
old guys.  A company like that can move much more easily than one
with 10 people, half of whom have kids.<br><br>We know because we make people move for Y Combinator, and it doesn't
seem to be a problem. The advantage of being able to work together
face to face for three months outweighs the inconvenience of moving.
Ask anyone who's done it.<br><br>The mobility of seed-stage startups means that seed funding is a
national business.  One of the most common emails we get is from
people asking if we can help them set up a local clone of Y Combinator.
But this just wouldn't work. Seed funding isn't regional, just as
big research universities aren't.<br><br>Is seed funding not merely national, but international?  Interesting
question.  There are signs it may be.  We've had an ongoing
stream of founders from outside the US, and they tend to do
particularly well, because they're all people who were so determined
to succeed that they were willing to move to another country to do
it.<br><br>The more mobile startups get, the harder it would be to start new 
silicon valleys.  If startups are mobile, the best local talent 
will go to the real Silicon Valley,
and all they'll get at the local one will be the people who didn't
have the energy to move.<br><br>This is not a nationalistic idea, incidentally.  It's cities that
compete, not countries.  Atlanta is just as hosed as Munich.<br><br><b>7. Better Judgement Needed</b><br><br>If the number of startups increases dramatically, then the people
whose job is to judge them are going to have to get better at
it.  I'm thinking particularly of investors and acquirers.  We now
get on the order of 1000 applications a year.  What are we going
to do if we get 10,000?<br><br>That's actually an alarming idea.  But we'll figure out some kind
of answer.  We'll have to.  It will probably involve writing some
software, but fortunately we can do that.<br><br>Acquirers will also have to get better at picking winners.   
They generally do better than investors, because they pick
later, when there's more performance to measure.  But even at the
most advanced acquirers, identifying companies to
buy is extremely ad hoc, and completing the acquisition often
involves a great deal of unneccessary friction.<br><br>I think acquirers may eventually have chief acquisition officers
who will both identify good acquisitions and make the deals happen.
At the moment those two functions are separate.  Promising new
startups are often discovered by developers.  If someone powerful
enough wants to buy them, the deal is handed over to corp dev guys
to negotiate.  It would be better if both were combined in
one group, headed by someone with a technical background and some
vision of what they wanted to accomplish.  Maybe in the future big
companies will have both a VP of Engineering responsible for
technology developed in-house, and a CAO responsible for bringing
technology in from outside.<br><br>At the moment, there is no one within big companies who gets in
trouble when they buy a startup for $200 million that they could
have bought earlier for $20 million.  There should start to be
someone who gets in trouble for that.<br><br><b>8. College Will Change</b><br><br>If the best hackers start their own companies after college
instead of getting jobs, that will change what happens in college.
Most of these changes will be for the better.  I think the experience
of college is warped in a bad way by the expectation that afterward
you'll be judged by potential employers.<br><br>One change will be in the meaning of "after
college," which will switch from when one graduates from college
to when one leaves it.  If you're starting your own company, why
do you need a degree?  We don't encourage people to start startups
during college, but the best founders are certainly
capable of it.  Some of the most successful companies we've funded
were started by undergrads.<br><br>I grew up in a time where college degrees seemed really important,
so I'm alarmed to be saying things like this, but there's nothing
magical about a degree.  There's nothing that magically changes
after you take that last exam.  The importance of degrees is due
solely to the administrative needs of large organizations.  These
can certainly affect your life—it's hard to get into grad
school, or to get a work visa in the US, without an undergraduate
degree—but tests like this will matter less and
less.<br><br>As well as mattering less whether students get degrees, it will
also start to matter less where they go to college.  In a startup
you're judged by users, and they don't care where you went to
college.  So in a world of startups, elite universities will play
less of a role as gatekeepers.  In the US it's a national scandal
how easily children of rich parents game college admissions.
But the way this problem ultimately gets solved may not be by
reforming the universities but by going around them.  We in the
technology world are used to that sort of solution: you don't beat
the incumbents; you redefine the problem to make them irrelevant.<br><br>The greatest value of universities is not the brand name or perhaps
even the classes so much as the people you meet.  If
it becomes common to start a startup after college, students may start
trying to maximize this.  Instead of focusing on getting
internships at companies they want to work for, they may start
to focus on working with other students they want as cofounders.<br><br>What students do in their classes will change too.  Instead of
trying to get good grades to impress future employers, students
will try to learn things.  We're talking about some pretty dramatic
changes here.<br><br><b>9. Lots of Competitors</b><br><br>If it gets easier to start a startup, it's easier for competitors too. 
That doesn't erase the advantage of
increased cheapness, however.  You're not all playing a zero-sum
game.  There's not some fixed number of startups that can succeed,
regardless of how many are started.<br><br>In fact, I don't think there's any limit to the number of startups
that could succeed.  Startups succeed by creating wealth, which is
the satisfaction of people's desires.  And people's desires seem
to be effectively infinite, at least in the short term.<br><br>What the increasing number of startups does mean is that you won't
be able to sit on a good idea.  Other people have your idea, and
they'll be increasingly likely to do something about it.<br><br><b>10. Faster Advances</b><br><br>There's a good side to that, at least for consumers of
technology.  If people get right to work implementing ideas instead
of sitting on them, technology will evolve faster.<br><br>Some kinds of innovations happen a company at a time, like the
punctuated equilibrium model of evolution.  There are some kinds
of ideas that are so threatening that it's hard for big companies
even to think of them.  Look at what a hard time Microsoft is
having discovering web apps.  They're like a character in a movie
that everyone in the audience can see something bad is about to
happen to, but who can't see it himself.  The big innovations
that happen a company at a time will obviously happen faster if
the rate of new companies increases.<br><br>But in fact there will be a double speed increase.  People won't
wait as long to act on new ideas, but also those ideas will
increasingly be developed within startups rather than big companies.
Which means technology will evolve faster per company as well.<br><br>Big companies are just not a good place to make things happen fast.
I talked recently to a founder whose startup had been acquired by
a big company.  He was a precise sort of guy, so he'd measured their
productivity before and after.  He counted lines of code, which can
be a dubious measure, but in this case was meaningful because it
was the same group of programmers.  He found they were one thirteenth
as productive after the acquisition.<br><br>The company that bought them was not a particularly stupid one.
I think what he was measuring was mostly the cost of bigness.  I
experienced this myself, and his number sounds about right.  There's
something about big companies that just sucks the energy out of
you.<br><br>Imagine what all that energy could do if it were put to use.  There
is an enormous latent capacity in the world's hackers that most
people don't even realize is there.  That's the main reason we do
Y Combinator: to let loose all this energy by making it easy for
hackers to start their own startups.<br><br><b>A Series of Tubes</b><br><br>The process of starting startups is currently like the plumbing in
an old house.  The pipes are narrow and twisty, and there are leaks
in every joint.  In the future this mess will gradually be replaced
by a single, huge pipe.  The water will still have to get from A
to B, but it will get there faster and without the risk of spraying
out through some random leak.<br><br>This will change a lot of things for the better.  In a big, straight
pipe like that, the force of being measured by one's performance
will propagate back through the whole system.  Performance is always
the ultimate test, but there are so many kinks in the plumbing now
that most people are insulated from it most of the time.  So you
end up with a world in which high school students think they need
to get good grades to get into elite colleges, and college students
think they need to get good grades to impress employers, within
which the employees waste most of their time in political battles,
and from which consumers have to buy anyway because there are so
few choices.  Imagine if that sequence became a big, straight pipe.
Then the effects of being measured by performance would propagate

<a href="webstartups.html">talk</a> I gave, one of the organizers 
got up on the
stage to deliver an impromptu rebuttal.  That never happened before.
I only heard the first few sentences, but that was enough to tell
what I said that upset him: that startups would do better if they
moved to Silicon Valley.<br><br>This conference was in London, and most of the audience seemed to
be from the UK.  So saying startups should move to Silicon Valley
seemed like a nationalistic remark: an obnoxious American telling
them that if they wanted to do things right they should all just
move to America.<br><br>Actually I'm less American than I seem.  I didn't say so, but I'm
British by birth.  And just as Jews are ex officio allowed to tell
Jewish jokes, I don't feel like I have to bother being diplomatic
with a British audience.<br><br>The idea that startups would do better to move to Silicon Valley
is not even a nationalistic one.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
It's the same thing I say to
startups in the US.  Y Combinator alternates between coasts every
6 months. Every other funding cycle is in Boston.  And even though
Boston is the second biggest startup hub in the US (and the world),
we tell the startups from those cycles that their best bet is to
move to Silicon Valley.  If that's true of Boston, it's even more
true of every other city.<br><br>This is about cities, not countries.<br><br>And I think I can prove I'm right.  You can easily reduce the
opposing argument ad what most people would agree was absurdum.
Few would be willing to claim that it doesn't matter at all where
a startup is—that a startup operating out of a small agricultural
town wouldn't benefit from moving to a startup hub.  Most people
could see how it might be helpful to be in a place where there was
infrastructure for startups, accumulated knowledge about how to
make them work, and other people trying to do it.  And yet whatever
argument you use to prove that startups don't need to move from
London to Silicon Valley could equally well be used to prove startups
don't need to move from smaller towns to London.<br><br>The difference between cities is a matter of degree.  And if, as
nearly everyone who knows agrees, startups are better off in Silicon
Valley than Boston, then they're better off in Silicon Valley than
everywhere else too.<br><br>I realize I might seem to have a vested interest in this conclusion,
because startups that move to the US might do it through Y Combinator.
But the American startups we've funded will attest that I say the
same thing to them.<br><br>I'm not claiming of course that every startup has to go to Silicon
Valley to succeed.  Just that all other things being equal, the
more of a startup hub a place is, the better startups will do there.
But other considerations can outweigh the advantages of moving.
I'm not saying founders with families should uproot them to move
halfway around the world; that might be too much of a distraction.<br><br>Immigration difficulties might be another reason to stay put.
Dealing with immigration problems is like raising money: for some
reason it seems to consume all your attention.  A startup can't
afford much of that.  One Canadian startup we funded spent about 6
months working on moving to the US.  Eventually they just gave up,
because they couldn't afford to take so much time away from working
on their software.<br><br>(If another country wanted to establish a rival to Silicon Valley,
the single best thing they could do might be to create a special
visa for startup founders.  US immigration policy is one of Silicon 
Valley's biggest weaknesses.)<br><br>If your startup is connected to a specific industry, you may be
better off in one of its centers.  A startup doing something related
to entertainment might want to be in New York or LA.<br><br>And finally, if a good investor has committed to fund
you if you stay where you are, you should probably stay.  Finding
investors is hard.  You generally shouldn't pass up a definite
funding offer to move.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>In fact, the quality of the investors may be the main advantage of
startup hubs.  Silicon Valley investors are noticeably more aggressive
than Boston ones.  Over and over, I've seen startups we've funded
snatched by west coast investors out from under the noses of Boston
investors who saw them first but acted too slowly.  At this year's
Boston Demo Day, I told the audience that this happened every year,
so if they saw a startup they liked, they should make them an offer.
And yet within a month it had happened again: an aggressive west
coast VC who had met the founder of a YC-funded startup a week
before beat out a Boston VC who had known him for years.  By the
time the Boston VC grasped what was happening, the deal was already
gone.<br><br>Boston investors will admit they're more conservative.  Some want
to believe this comes from the city's prudent Yankee character.
But Occam's razor suggests the truth is less flattering.  Boston
investors are probably more conservative than Silicon Valley investors
for the same reason Chicago investors are more conservative than
Boston ones.  They don't understand startups as well.<br><br>West coast investors aren't bolder because they're irresponsible
cowboys, or because the good weather makes them optimistic.  They're
bolder because they know what they're doing.  They're the skiers
who ski on the diamond slopes.  Boldness is the essence of venture
investing.  The way you get big returns is not by trying to avoid
losses, but by trying to ensure you get some of the big hits. And
the big hits often look risky at first.<br><br>Like Facebook.  Facebook was started in Boston.  Boston VCs had the
first shot at them.  But they said no, so Facebook moved to Silicon
Valley and raised money there.  The partner who turned them down
now says that "may turn out to have been a mistake."<br><br>Empirically, boldness wins.  If the aggressive ways of west coast
investors are going to come back to bite them, it has been a long
time coming.  Silicon Valley has been pulling ahead of Boston since
the 1970s.  If there was going to be a comeuppance for the west
coast investors, the bursting of the Bubble would have been it.
But since then the west coast has just pulled further ahead.<br><br>West coast investors are confident enough of their judgement to act
boldly; east coast investors, not so much; but anyone who thinks
east coast investors act that way out of prudence should see the
frantic reactions of an east coast VC in the process of losing a
deal to a west coast one.<br><br>In addition to the concentration that comes from specialization,
startup hubs are also markets.  And markets are usually centralized.
Even now, when traders could be anywhere, they cluster in a few
cities.  It's hard to say exactly what it is about face to face
contact that makes deals happen, but whatever it is, it hasn't yet
been duplicated by technology.<br><br>Walk down University Ave at the right time, and you might overhear
five different people talking on the phone about deals.  In fact,
this is part of the reason Y Combinator is in Boston half the time:
it's hard to stand that year round.  But though it can sometimes
be annoying to be surrounded by people who only think about one
thing, it's the place to be if that one thing is what you're trying
to do.<br><br>I was talking recently to someone who works on search at Google.
He knew a lot of people at Yahoo, so he was in a good position to
compare the two companies.  I asked him why Google was better at
search.  He said it wasn't anything specific Google did, but simply
that they understood search so much better.<br><br>And that's why startups thrive in startup hubs like Silicon Valley.
Startups are a very specialized business, as specialized as diamond
cutting.  And in startup hubs they understand it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
The nationalistic idea is the converse: that startups should
stay in a certain city because of the country it's in.  If you
really have a "one world" viewpoint, deciding to move from London
to Silicon Valley is no different from deciding to move from Chicago
to Silicon Valley.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
An investor who merely seems like he will fund you, however,
you can ignore.  Seeming like they will fund you one day is the way
investors say No.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, Harjeet Taggar, and Kulveer

an unexpected consequence: it made me realize I had a design
philosophy.  The main complaint of the more articulate critics was
that Arc seemed so flimsy. After years of working on it, all I had
to show for myself were a few thousand lines of macros?  Why hadn't
I worked on more substantial problems?<br><br>As I was mulling over these remarks it struck me how familiar they
seemed.  This was exactly the kind of thing people said at first
about Viaweb, and Y Combinator, and most of my essays.<br><br>When we launched Viaweb, it seemed laughable to VCs and e-commerce
"experts."  We were just a couple guys in an apartment,
which did not seem cool in 1995 the way it does now.  And the thing
we'd built, as far as they could tell, wasn't even software.
Software, to them, equalled big, honking Windows apps.  Since Viaweb
was the first <xa href="road.html">web-based app 
they'd seen, it seemed to be nothing
more than a website.  They were even more contemptuous when they
discovered that Viaweb didn't process credit card transactions (we
didn't for the whole first year).  Transaction processing seemed
to them what e-commerce was all about.  It sounded serious and
difficult.<br><br>And yet, mysteriously, Viaweb ended up crushing all its competitors.<br><br>The initial reaction to 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> was almost identical.  It
seemed laughably lightweight.  Startup funding meant series A rounds:
millions of dollars given to a small number of startups founded by
people with established credentials after months of serious,
businesslike meetings, on terms described in a document a foot
thick.  Y Combinator seemed inconsequential.  It's too early to say
yet whether Y Combinator will turn out like Viaweb, but judging
from the number of imitations, a lot of people seem to think we're
on to something.<br><br>I can't measure whether my essays are successful, except in page
views, but the reaction to them is at least different from when I
started.  At first the default reaction of the Slashdot trolls was
(translated into articulate terms): "Who is this guy and what
authority does he have to write about these topics?  I haven't read
the essay, but there's no way anything so short and written in such
an informal style could have anything useful to say about such and
such topic, when people with degrees in the subject have already
written many thick books about it." Now there's a new generation
of trolls on a new generation of sites, but they have at least
started to omit the initial "Who is this guy?"<br><br>Now people are saying the same things about Arc that they said at
first about Viaweb and Y Combinator and most of my essays.  Why the
pattern?  The answer, I realized, is that my m.o. for all four has
been the same.<br><br>Here it is: I like to find (a) simple solutions (b) to overlooked
problems (c) that actually need to be solved, and (d) deliver them
as informally as possible, (e) starting with a very crude version
1, then (f) iterating rapidly.<br><br>When I first laid out these principles explicitly, I noticed something
striking: this is practically a recipe for generating a contemptuous
initial reaction.  Though simple solutions are better, they don't
seem as impressive as complex ones.  Overlooked problems are by
definition problems that most people think don't matter.  Delivering
solutions in an informal way means that instead of judging something
by the way it's presented, people have to actually understand it,
which is more work.  And starting with a crude version 1 means your
initial effort is always small and incomplete.<br><br>I'd noticed, of course, that people never seemed to grasp new ideas
at first.  I thought it was just because most people were stupid.
Now I see there's more to it than that.  <!-- This particular m.o. is
practically tuned to hit everyday stupidity square on. --> Like a
contrarian investment fund, someone following this strategy will
almost always be doing things that seem wrong to the average person.<br><br>As with contrarian investment strategies, that's exactly the point.
This technique is successful (in the long term) because it gives you
all the advantages other people forgo by trying to seem legit.  If
you work on overlooked problems, you're more likely to discover new
things, because you have less competition.  If you deliver solutions
informally, you (a) save all the effort you would have had to expend
to make them look impressive, and (b) avoid the danger of fooling
yourself as well as your audience.  And if you release a crude
version 1 then iterate, your solution can benefit from the imagination
of nature, which, as Feynman pointed out, is more powerful than
your own.<br><br>In the case of Viaweb, the simple solution was to make the software
run on the server.  The overlooked problem was to generate web sites
automatically; in 1995, online stores were all made by hand by human
designers, but we knew this wouldn't scale.  The part that actually
mattered was graphic design, not transaction processing.
The informal delivery mechanism was me, showing up in jeans and a
t-shirt at some retailer's office.  And the crude version 1 was,
if I remember correctly, less than 10,000 lines of code when we
launched.<br><br>The power of this technique extends beyond startups and programming
languages and essays.  It probably extends to any kind of creative
work.  Certainly it can be used in painting: this is exactly 
what Cezanne and Klee did.<br><br>At Y Combinator we bet money on it, in the sense that we encourage
the startups we fund to work this way. There are always new ideas
right under your nose.  So look for simple things that other people
have overlooked—things people will later claim were 
"obvious"—especially when they've been led astray by obsolete 
conventions,
or by trying to do things that are superficially impressive.  Figure
out what the real problem is, and make sure you solve that.  Don't
worry about trying to look corporate; the product is what wins in
the long term.  And launch as soon as you can, so you start learning
from users what you should have been making.<br><br><a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> is a classic example of 
this approach.  When Reddit first
launched, it seemed like there was nothing to it.  To the graphically
unsophisticated its deliberately minimal design seemed like no
design at all.  But Reddit solved the real problem, which was to
tell people what was new and otherwise stay out of the way.  As a
result it became massively successful.  Now that conventional ideas
have caught up with it, it seems obvious.  People look at Reddit
and think the founders were lucky.  Like all such things, it was
harder than it looked.  The Reddits pushed so hard against the
current that they reversed it; now it looks like they're merely
floating downstream.<br><br>So when you look at something like Reddit and think "I wish I could
think of an idea like that," remember: ideas like that are all
around you.  But you ignore them because they look wrong.<br><br><br clear="all"></xa></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=116938">comment</a>
that set me thinking:
<blockquote>
  Something about hacker culture that never really set well with
  me was this � the nastiness. ... I just don't understand why people
  troll like they do.
</blockquote>
I've thought a lot over the last couple years about the problem of
trolls.  It's an old one, as old as forums, but
we're still just learning what the causes are and how to address
them.<br><br>There are two senses of the word "troll."  In the original sense
it meant someone, usually an outsider, who deliberately stirred up
fights in a forum by saying controversial things.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
For example,
someone who didn't use a certain programming language might go to
a forum for users of that language and make disparaging remarks
about it, then sit back and watch as people rose to the bait.  This
sort of trolling was in the nature of a practical joke, like letting
a bat loose in a room full of people.<br><br>The definition then spread to people who behaved like assholes in
forums, whether intentionally or not.  Now when people talk about
trolls they usually mean this broader sense of the word.  Though
in a sense this is historically inaccurate, it is in other ways
more accurate, because when someone is being an asshole it's usually
uncertain even in their own mind how much is deliberate.
That is arguably one of the defining qualities of an asshole.<br><br>I think trolling in the broader sense has four causes.  The most
important is distance.  People will say things in anonymous forums
that they'd never dare say to someone's face, just as they'll do
things in cars that they'd never do as pedestrians � like tailgate
people, or honk at them, or cut them off.<br><br>Trolling tends to be particularly bad in forums related to computers,
and I think that's due to the kind of people you find there.  Most
of them (myself included) are more comfortable dealing with abstract
ideas than with people.  Hackers can be abrupt even in person.  Put
them on an anonymous forum, and the problem gets worse.<br><br>The third cause of trolling is incompetence.  If you disagree with
something, it's easier to say "you suck" than to figure out and
explain exactly what you disagree with.  You're also safe that way
from refutation.  In this respect trolling is a lot like graffiti.
Graffiti happens at the intersection of ambition and incompetence:
people want to make their mark on the world, but have no other way
to do it than literally making a mark on the world.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The final contributing factor is the culture of the forum.  Trolls
are like children (many <i>are</i> children) in that they're capable of
a wide range of behavior depending on what they think will be
tolerated.  In a place where rudeness isn't tolerated, most can be
polite.  But vice versa as well.<br><br>There's a sort of Gresham's Law of trolls: trolls are willing to
use a forum with a lot of thoughtful people in it, but thoughtful
people aren't willing to use a forum with a lot of trolls in it.
Which means that once trolling takes hold, it tends to become the
dominant culture.  That had already happened to Slashdot and Digg by
the time I paid attention to comment threads there, but I watched
it happen to Reddit.<br><br><xa href="http://news.ycombinator.com">News.YC is, among other things, an experiment to see if this fate
can be avoided.  The sites's <a href="http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html">guidelines</a>
explicitly ask people not to say things they wouldn't say face to
face.  If someone starts being rude, other users will step in and
tell them to stop.  And when people seem to be deliberately trolling,
we ban them ruthlessly.<br><br>Technical tweaks may also help.  On Reddit, votes on your comments
don't affect your karma score, but they do on News.YC.  And it does
seem to influence people when they can see their reputation in the
eyes of their peers drain away after making an asshole remark.
Often users have second thoughts and delete such comments.<br><br>One might worry this would prevent people from expressing controversial
ideas, but empirically that doesn't seem to be what happens.  When
people say something substantial that gets modded down, they
stubbornly leave it up.  What people delete are wisecracks, because
they have less invested in them.<br><br>So far the experiment seems to be working.  The level of conversation
on News.YC is as high as on any forum I've seen.  But we still only
have about 8,000 uniques a day.  The conversations on Reddit were
good when it was that small.  The challenge is whether we can keep
things this way.<br><br>I'm optimistic we will.  We're not depending just on technical
tricks.  The core users of News.YC are mostly refugees from other
sites that were overrun by trolls.  They feel about trolls roughly
the way refugees from Cuba or Eastern Europe feel about dictatorships.
So there are a lot of people working to keep this from happening
again.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I mean forum in the general sense of a place to exchange views.
The original Internet forums were not web sites but Usenet newsgroups.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
I'm talking here about everyday tagging.  Some graffiti is
quite impressive (anything becomes art if you do it well enough)
but the median tag is just visual spam.<br><br></xa></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://spring.jumpidea.com/2008/08/paul-graham-trolls.html">Russian Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

out what we do.  Even though Y Combinator is now 3 years old, we're still
trying to understand its implications.)</i><br><br>
I was annoyed recently to read a description of Y Combinator that
said "Y Combinator does seed funding for startups."  What was
especially annoying about it was that I wrote it.  This doesn't
really convey what we do.  And the reason it's inaccurate is that,
paradoxically, funding very early stage startups is not mainly about
funding.<br><br>Saying YC does seed funding for startups is a description in terms
of earlier models.  It's like calling a car a horseless carriage.<br><br>When you scale animals you can't just keep everything in proportion.
For example, volume grows as the cube of linear dimension, but
surface area only as the square.  So as animals get bigger they
have trouble radiating heat.  That's why mice and rabbits are furry
and elephants and hippos aren't.  You can't make a mouse by scaling
down an elephant.<br><br>YC represents a new, smaller kind of animal—so much smaller
that all the rules are different.<br><br>Before us, most companies in the startup funding business were
venture capital funds.  VCs generally fund later stage companies
than we do.  And they supply so much money that, even though the
other things they do may be very valuable, it's not that inaccurate
to regard VCs as sources of money.  Good VCs are "smart money," but
they're still money.<br><br>All good investors supply a combination of money and help.  But
these scale differently, just as volume and surface area do.  Late
stage investors supply huge amounts of money and
comparatively little help: when a company about to go public gets
a mezzanine round of $50 million, the deal tends to be almost
entirely about money.  As you move earlier in the venture
funding process, the ratio of help to money increases, because
earlier stage companies have different needs.  Early stage companies
need less money because they're smaller and cheaper to run, but
they need more help because life is so precarious for them.  So
when VCs do a series A round for, say, $2 million, they generally
expect to offer a significant amount of help along with the money.<br><br>Y Combinator occupies the earliest end of the spectrum.  We're at
least one and generally two steps before VC funding.  (Though some
startups go straight from YC to VC, the most common trajectory is
to do an angel round first.)  And what happens at Y Combinator is
as different from what happens in a series A round as a series A
round is from a mezzanine financing.<br><br>At our end, money is almost a negligible factor.  The startup usually
consists of just the founders. Their living expenses are the
company's main expense, and since most founders are under 30, their
living expenses are low.  But at this early stage companies need a
lot of help.  Practically every question is still unanswered.  Some
companies we've funded have been working on their software for a
year or more, but others haven't decided what to work on, or even
who the founders should be.<br><br>When PR people and journalists recount the histories of startups
after they've become big, they always underestimate how uncertain
things were at first.  They're not being deliberately misleading.
When you look at a company like Google, it's hard to imagine they
could once have been small and helpless.  Sure, at one point they
were a just a couple guys in a garage—but even then their
greatness was assured, and all they had to do was roll forward along
the railroad tracks of destiny.<br><br>Far from it.  A lot of startups with just as promising beginnings
end up failing.  Google has such momentum now that it would be hard
for anyone to stop them.  But all it would have taken in the beginning
would have been for two Google employees to focus on the wrong
things for six months, and the company could have died.<br><br>We know, because we've been there, just how vulnerable startups are
in the earliest phases.  Curiously enough, that's why founders tend
to get so rich from them.  Reward is always proportionate to risk,
and very early stage startups are insanely risky.<br><br>What we really do at Y Combinator is get startups launched straight.
One of many metaphors you could use for YC is a steam catapult on
an aircraft carrier.  We get startups airborne.  Barely airborne,
but enough that they can accelerate fast.<br><br>When you're launching planes they have to be set up properly or
you're just launching projectiles.  They have to be pointed straight
down the deck; the wings have to be trimmed properly; the engines
have to be at full power; the pilot has to be ready.  These are the
kind of problems we deal with.  After we fund startups we work
closely with them for three months—so closely in fact that
we insist they move to where we are.  And what we do in those three
months is make sure everything is set up for launch.  If there are
tensions between cofounders we help sort them out.  We get all the
paperwork set up properly so there are no nasty surprises later.
If the founders aren't sure what to focus on first, we try to figure
that out.  If there is some obstacle right in front of them, we
either try to remove it, or shift the startup sideways.  The goal
is to get every distraction out of the way so the founders can use
that time to build (or finish building) something impressive.  And
then near the end of the three months we push the button on the
steam catapult in the form of Demo Day, where the current group of
startups present to pretty much every investor in Silicon Valley.<br><br>Launching companies isn't identical with launching products.  Though
we do spend a lot of time on launch strategies for products, there
are some things that take too long to build for a startup to launch
them before raising their next round of funding.  Several of the
most promising startups we've funded haven't launched their products
yet, but are definitely launched as companies.<br><br>In the earliest stage, startups not only have more questions to
answer, but they tend to be different kinds of questions.  In later
stage startups the questions are about deals, or hiring, or
organization.  In the earliest phase they tend to be about technology
and design.  What do you make?  That's the first problem to solve.
That's why our motto is "Make something people want."  This is
always a good thing for companies to do, but it's even more important
early on, because it sets the bounds for every other question.  Who
you hire, how much money you raise, how you market yourself—they
all depend on what you're making.<br><br>Because the early problems are so much about technology and design,
you probably need to be hackers to do what we do.  While some VCs
have technical backgrounds, I don't know any who still write code.
Their expertise is mostly in business—as it should be, because
that's the kind of expertise you need in the phase between series
A and (if you're lucky) IPO.<br><br>We're so different from VCs that we're really a different kind of
animal.  Can we claim founders are better off as a result of this
new type of venture firm?  I'm pretty sure the answer is yes, because
YC is an improved version of what happened to our startup, and our
case was not atypical.  We started Viaweb with $10,000 in seed money
from our friend Julian.  He was a lawyer and arranged all our
paperwork, so we could just code.  We spent three months building
a version 1, which we then presented to investors to raise more
money.  Sounds familiar, doesn't it?  But YC improves on that
significantly.  Julian knew a lot about law and business, but his
advice ended there; he was not a startup guy.  So we made some basic
mistakes early on.  And when we presented to investors, we presented
to only 2, because that was all we knew.  If we'd had our later
selves to encourage and advise us, and Demo Day to present at, we
would have been in much better shape.  We probably could have raised
money at 3 to 5 times the valuation we did.<br><br>If we take 7% of a company we fund, the founders only have to do
<a href="equity.html">7.5%</a> better in their next round of funding
to end up net ahead.  We certainly manage that.<br><br>So who is our 7% coming out of?  If the founders end up net ahead
it's not coming out of them.  So is it coming out of later stage
investors?  Well, they do end up paying more.  But I think they pay
more because the company is actually more valuable.  And later stage
investors have no problem with that.  The returns of a VC fund
depend on the quality of the companies they invest in, not how
cheaply they can buy stock in them.<br><br>If what we do is useful, why wasn't anyone doing it before?  There
are two answers to that.  One is that people were doing it before,
just haphazardly on a smaller scale.  Before us, seed funding came
primarily from individual angel investors.  Larry and Sergey, for
example, got their seed funding from Andy Bechtolsheim, one of the
founders of Sun.  And because he was a startup guy he probably gave
them useful advice.  But raising money from angel investors is a
hit or miss thing.  It's a sideline for most of them, so they only
do a handful of deals a year and they don't spend a lot of time on
the startups they invest in.  And they're hard to reach, because
they don't want random startups pestering them with business plans.
The Google guys were lucky because they knew someone who knew
Bechtolsheim.  It generally takes a personal introduction with
angels.<br><br>The other reason no one was doing quite what we do is that till
recently it was a lot more expensive to start a startup.  You'll
notice we haven't funded any biotech startups.  That's still
expensive.  But advancing technology has made web startups so cheap
that you really can get a company airborne for $15,000.  If you
understand how to operate a steam catapult, at least.<br><br>So in effect what's happened is that a new ecological niche has
opened up, and Y Combinator is the new kind of animal that has moved
into it.  We're not a replacement for venture capital funds.  We
occupy a new, adjacent niche.  And conditions in our niche are
really quite different.  It's not just that the problems we face
are different; the whole structure of the business is different.
VCs are playing a zero-sum game.  They're all competing for a slice
of a fixed amount of "deal flow," and that explains a lot of their
behavior.  Whereas our m.o. is to create new deal flow, by encouraging
hackers who would have gotten jobs to start their own startups
instead.  We compete more with employers than VCs.<br><br>It's not surprising something like this would happen.  Most fields
become more specialized—more articulated—as they develop,
and startups are certainly an area in which there has been a lot
of development over the past couple decades.  The venture business
in its present form is only about forty years old.  It stands to
reason it would evolve.<br><br>And it's natural that the new niche would at first be described,
even by its inhabitants, in terms of the old one.  But really Y
Combinator is not in the startup funding business.  Really we're
more of a small, furry steam catapult.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris

March 2008, rev. June 2008<br><br>Technology tends to separate normal from natural.  Our bodies
weren't designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, or
to get so little exercise.  
There may be a similar problem with the way we work: 
a normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour
or sugar is for us physically.<br><br>I began to suspect this after spending several years working 
with startup founders.  I've now worked with over 200 of them, and I've
noticed a definite difference between programmers working on their
own startups and those working for large organizations.
I wouldn't say founders seem happier, necessarily;
starting a startup can be very stressful. Maybe the best way to put
it is to say that they're happier in the sense that your body is
happier during a long run than sitting on a sofa eating
doughnuts.<br><br>Though they're statistically abnormal, startup founders seem to be
working in a way that's more natural for humans.<br><br>I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild that
I'd only seen in zoos before. It was remarkable how different they
seemed. Particularly lions. Lions in the wild seem about ten times
more alive. They're like different animals. I suspect that working
for oneself feels better to humans in much the same way that living
in the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion.
Life in a zoo is easier, but it isn't the life they were designed
for.<br><br>
<b>Trees</b><br><br>What's so unnatural about working for a big company?  The root of
the problem is that humans weren't meant to work in such large
groups.<br><br>Another thing you notice when you see animals in the wild is that
each species thrives in groups of a certain size.  A herd of impalas
might have 100 adults; baboons maybe 20; lions rarely 10.  Humans
also seem designed to work in groups, and what I've read about
hunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my own
experience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8
work well; by 20 they're getting hard to manage; and a group of 50
is really unwieldy.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>
Whatever the upper limit is, we are clearly not meant to work in
groups of several hundred.  And yet—for reasons having more
to do with technology than human nature—a great many people
work for companies with hundreds or thousands of employees.<br><br>Companies know groups that large wouldn't work, so they divide
themselves into units small enough to work together.  But to
coordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.<br><br>These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure.  Your
boss is the point where your group attaches to the tree.  But when
you use this trick for dividing a large group into smaller ones,
something strange happens that I've never heard anyone mention
explicitly.  In the group one level up from yours, your boss
represents your entire group.  A group of 10 managers is not merely
a group of 10 people working together in the usual way.  It's really
a group of groups.  Which means for a group of 10 managers to work
together as if they were simply a group of 10 individuals, the group
working for each manager would have to work as if they were a single
person—the workers and manager would each share only one
person's worth of freedom between them.<br><br>In practice a group of people are never able to act as if they were
one person.  But in a large organization divided into groups in
this way, the pressure is always in that direction.  Each group
tries its best to work as if it were the small group of individuals
that humans were designed to work in.  That was the point of creating
it.  And when you propagate that constraint, the result is that
each person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the
size of the entire tree.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Anyone who's worked for a large organization has felt this.  You
can feel the difference between working for a company with 100
employees and one with 10,000, even if your group has only 10 people.<br><br>
<b>Corn Syrup</b><br><br>A group of 10 people within a large organization is a kind of fake
tribe.  The number of people you interact with is about right.  But
something is missing: individual initiative.  Tribes of hunter-gatherers
have much more freedom.  The leaders have a little more power than other
members of the tribe, but they don't generally tell them what to
do and when the way a boss can.<br><br>It's not your boss's fault.  The real problem is that in the group
above you in the hierarchy, your entire group is one virtual person.
Your boss is just the way that constraint is imparted to you.<br><br>So working in a group of 10 people within a large organization feels
both right and wrong at the same time.   On the surface it feels
like the kind of group you're meant to work in, but something major
is missing.  A job at a big company is like high fructose corn
syrup: it has some of the qualities of things you're meant to like,
but is disastrously lacking in others.<br><br>Indeed, food is an excellent metaphor to explain what's wrong with
the usual sort of job.<br><br>For example, working for a big company is the default thing to do,
at least for programmers.  How bad could it be?  Well, food shows
that pretty clearly.  If you were dropped at a random point in
America today, nearly all the food around you would be bad for you.
Humans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high
fructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil.  And yet if
you analyzed the contents of the average grocery store you'd probably
find these four ingredients accounted for most of the calories.
"Normal" food is terribly bad for you.  The only people who eat
what humans were actually designed to eat are a few Birkenstock-wearing
weirdos in Berkeley.<br><br>If "normal" food is so bad for us, why is it so common?  There are
two main reasons. One is that it has more immediate appeal.  You
may feel lousy an hour after eating that pizza, but eating the first
couple bites feels great.  The other is economies of scale.
Producing junk food scales; producing fresh vegetables doesn't.
Which means (a) junk food can be very cheap, and (b) it's worth
spending a lot to market it.<br><br>If people have to choose between something that's cheap, heavily
marketed, and appealing in the short term, and something that's
expensive, obscure, and appealing in the long term, which do you
think most will choose?<br><br>It's the same with work.  The average MIT graduate wants to work
at Google or Microsoft, because it's a recognized brand, it's safe,
and they'll get paid a good salary right away.  It's the job
equivalent of the pizza they had for lunch.  The drawbacks will
only become apparent later, and then only in a vague sense of
malaise.<br><br>And founders and early employees of startups, meanwhile, are like
the Birkenstock-wearing weirdos of Berkeley:  though a tiny minority
of the population, they're the ones living as humans are meant to.
In an artificial world, only extremists live naturally.<br><br>
<b>Programmers</b><br><br>The restrictiveness of big company jobs is particularly hard on
programmers, because the essence of programming is to build new
things.  Sales people make much the same pitches every day; support
people answer much the same questions; but once you've written a
piece of code you don't need to write it again.  So a programmer
working as programmers are meant to is always making new things.
And when you're part of an organization whose structure gives each
person freedom in inverse proportion to the size of the tree, you're
going to face resistance when you do something new.<br><br>This seems an inevitable consequence of bigness.  It's true even
in the smartest companies.  I was talking recently to a founder who
considered starting a startup right out of college, but went to
work for Google instead because he thought he'd learn more there.
He didn't learn as much as he expected.  Programmers learn by doing,
and most of the things he wanted to do, he couldn't—sometimes
because the company wouldn't let him, but often because the company's
code wouldn't let him.  Between the drag of legacy code, the overhead
of doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictions
imposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try a
fraction of the things he would have liked to.  He said he has
learned much more in his own startup, despite the fact that he has
to do all the company's errands as well as programming, because at
least when he's programming he can do whatever he wants.<br><br>An obstacle downstream propagates upstream.  If you're not allowed
to implement new ideas, you stop having them.  And vice versa: when
you can do whatever you want, you have more ideas about what to do.
So working for yourself makes your brain more powerful in the same
way a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.<br><br>Working for yourself doesn't have to mean starting a startup, of
course.  But a programmer deciding between a regular job at a big
company and their own startup is probably going to learn more doing
the startup.<br><br>You can adjust the amount of freedom you get by scaling the size
of company you work for.  If you start the company, you'll have the
most freedom.  If you become one of the first 10 employees you'll
have almost as much freedom as the founders.  Even a company with
100 people will feel different from one with 1000.<br><br>Working for a small company doesn't ensure freedom.  The tree
structure of large organizations sets an upper bound on freedom,
not a lower bound.  The head of a small company may still choose
to be a tyrant.  The point is that a large organization is compelled
by its structure to be one.<br><br>
<b>Consequences</b><br><br>That has real consequences for both organizations and individuals.
One is that companies will inevitably slow down as they grow larger,
no matter how hard they try to keep their startup mojo.  It's a
consequence of the tree structure that every large organization is
forced to adopt.<br><br>Or rather, a large organization could only avoid slowing down if
they avoided tree structure.  And since human nature limits the
size of group that can work together, the only way I can imagine
for larger groups to avoid tree structure would be to have no
structure: to have each group actually be independent, and to work
together the way components of a market economy do.<br><br>That might be worth exploring.  I suspect there are already some
highly partitionable businesses that lean this way.  But I don't
know any technology companies that have done it.<br><br>There is one thing companies can do short of structuring themselves
as sponges:  they can stay small.  If I'm right, then it really
pays to keep a company as small as it can be at every stage.
Particularly a technology company.  Which means it's doubly important
to hire the best people.  Mediocre hires hurt you twice: they get
less done, but they also make you big, because you need more of
them to solve a given problem.<br><br>For individuals the upshot is the same: aim small.  It will always
suck to work for large organizations, and the larger the organization,
the more it will suck.<br><br>In an <a href="start.html">essay</a> I wrote a couple years ago 
I advised graduating seniors
to work for a couple years for another company before starting their
own.  I'd modify that now.  Work for another company if you want
to, but only for a small one, and if you want to start your own
startup, go ahead.<br><br>The reason I suggested college graduates not start startups immediately
was that I felt most would fail.  And they will.  But ambitious
programmers are better off doing their own thing and failing than
going to work at a big company.  Certainly they'll learn more.  They
might even be better off financially.  A lot of people in their
early twenties get into debt, because their expenses grow even
faster than the salary that seemed so high when they left school.
At least if you start a startup and fail your net worth will be
zero rather than negative.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>We've now funded so many different types of founders that we have
enough data to see patterns, and there seems to be no benefit from
working for a big company.  The people who've worked for a few years
do seem better than the ones straight out of college, but only
because they're that much older.<br><br>The people who come to us from big companies often seem kind of
conservative.  It's hard to say how much is because big companies
made them that way, and how much is the natural conservatism that
made them work for the big companies in the first place.  But
certainly a large part of it is learned.  I know because I've seen
it burn off.<br><br>Having seen that happen so many times is one of the things that
convinces me that working for oneself, or at least for a small
group, is the natural way for programmers to live.  Founders arriving
at Y Combinator often have the downtrodden air of refugees.  Three
months later they're transformed: they have so much more 
<a href="http://paulmckellar.com/photos/03l">confidence</a>
that they seem as if they've grown several inches taller. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
Strange as this sounds, they seem both more worried and happier at the same
time.  Which is exactly how I'd describe the way lions seem in the
wild.<br><br>Watching employees get transformed into founders makes it clear
that the difference between the two is due mostly to environment—and
in particular that the environment in big companies is toxic to
programmers.   In the first couple weeks of working on their own
startup they seem to come to life, because finally they're working
the way people are meant to.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
When I talk about humans being meant or designed to live a
certain way, I mean by evolution.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
It's not only the leaves who suffer.  The constraint propagates
up as well as down.  So managers are constrained too; instead of
just doing things, they have to act through subordinates.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Do not finance your startup with credit cards.  Financing a
startup with debt is usually a stupid move, and credit card debt
stupidest of all.  Credit card debt is a bad idea, period.  It is
a trap set by evil companies for the desperate and the foolish.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
The founders we fund used to be younger (initially we encouraged
undergrads to apply), and the first couple times I saw this I used
to wonder if they were actually getting physically taller.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Ross Boucher, Aaron Iba, Abby

Twenty years ago,
writers wrote and readers read.  The web lets readers respond, and
increasingly they do—in comment threads, on forums, and in their
own blog posts.<br><br>Many who respond to something disagree with it.  That's to be
expected.  Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing.
And when you agree there's less to say.  You could expand on something
the author said, but he has probably already explored the
most interesting implications.  When you disagree you're entering
territory he may not have explored.<br><br>The result is there's a lot more disagreeing going on, especially
measured by the word.  That doesn't mean people are getting angrier.
The structural change in the way we communicate is enough to account
for it.  But though it's not anger that's driving the increase in
disagreement, there's a danger that the increase in disagreement
will make people angrier.  Particularly online, where it's easy to
say things you'd never say face to face.<br><br>If we're all going to be disagreeing more, we should be careful to
do it well.  What does it mean to disagree well?   Most readers can
tell the difference between mere name-calling and a carefully
reasoned refutation, but I think it would help to put names on the
intermediate stages.  So here's an attempt at a disagreement
hierarchy:<br><br>
<b>DH0. Name-calling.</b><br><br>This is the lowest form of disagreement, and probably also the most
common.  We've all seen comments like this:
<blockquote>
  u r a fag!!!!!!!!!!
</blockquote>
But it's important to realize that more articulate name-calling has
just as little weight.  A comment like
<blockquote>
  The author is a self-important dilettante.
</blockquote>
is really nothing more than a pretentious version of "u r a fag."<br><br>
<b>DH1. Ad Hominem.</b><br><br>An ad hominem attack is not quite as weak as mere name-calling.  It
might actually carry some weight.  For example, if a senator wrote
an article saying senators' salaries should be increased, one could
respond:
<blockquote>
  Of course he would say that.  He's a senator.
</blockquote>
This wouldn't refute the author's argument, but it may at least be
relevant to the case.  It's still a very weak form of disagreement,
though.  If there's something wrong with the senator's argument,
you should say what it is; and if there isn't, what difference does
it make that he's a senator?<br><br>Saying that an author lacks the authority to write about a topic
is a variant of ad hominem—and a particularly useless sort, because
good ideas often come from outsiders.  The question is whether the
author is correct or not.  If his lack of authority caused him to
make mistakes, point those out.  And if it didn't, it's not a
problem.<br><br>
<b>DH2. Responding to Tone.</b><br><br>The next level up we start to see responses to the writing, rather
than the writer.  The lowest form of these is to disagree with the
author's tone.  E.g.
<blockquote>
  I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such
  a cavalier fashion.
</blockquote>
Though better than attacking the author, this is still a weak form
of disagreement.  It matters much more whether the author is wrong
or right than what his tone is.  Especially since tone is so hard
to judge.  Someone who has a chip on their shoulder about some topic
might be offended by a tone that to other readers seemed neutral.<br><br>So if the worst thing you can say about something is to criticize
its tone, you're not saying much.  Is the author flippant, but
correct?  Better that than grave and wrong.  And if the author is
incorrect somewhere, say where.<br><br><b>DH3. Contradiction.</b><br><br>In this stage we finally get responses to what was said, rather
than how or by whom.  The lowest form of response to an argument
is simply to state the opposing case, with little or no supporting
evidence.<br><br>This is often combined with DH2 statements, as in:
<blockquote>
  I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such
  a cavalier fashion.  Intelligent design is a legitimate scientific
  theory.
</blockquote>
Contradiction can sometimes have some weight.  Sometimes merely
seeing the opposing case stated explicitly is enough to see that
it's right.  But usually evidence will help.<br><br><b>DH4. Counterargument.</b><br><br>At level 4 we reach the first form of convincing disagreement:
counterargument.  Forms up to this point can usually be ignored as
proving nothing.  Counterargument might prove something.  The problem
is, it's hard to say exactly what.<br><br>Counterargument is contradiction plus reasoning and/or evidence.
When aimed squarely at the original argument, it can be convincing.
But unfortunately it's common for counterarguments to be aimed at
something slightly different.  More often than not, two people
arguing passionately about something are actually arguing about two
different things.  Sometimes they even agree with one another, but
are so caught up in their squabble they don't realize it.<br><br>There could be a legitimate reason for arguing against something
slightly different from what the original author said: when you
feel they missed the heart of the matter.  But when you do that,
you should say explicitly you're doing it.<br><br><b>DH5. Refutation.</b><br><br>The most convincing form of disagreement is refutation.  It's also
the rarest, because it's the most work.  Indeed, the disagreement
hierarchy forms a kind of pyramid, in the sense that the higher you
go the fewer instances you find.<br><br>To refute someone you probably have to quote them.  You have to
find a "smoking gun," a passage in whatever you disagree with that
you feel is mistaken, and then explain why it's mistaken.  If you
can't find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguing
with a straw man.<br><br>While refutation generally entails quoting, quoting doesn't necessarily
imply refutation.  Some writers quote parts of things they disagree
with to give the appearance of legitimate refutation, then follow
with a response as low as DH3 or even DH0.<br><br><b>DH6. Refuting the Central Point.</b><br><br>The force of a refutation depends on what you refute.  The most
powerful form of disagreement is to refute someone's central point.<br><br>Even as high as DH5 we still sometimes see deliberate dishonesty,
as when someone picks out minor points of an argument and refutes
those.  Sometimes the spirit in which this is done makes it more
of a sophisticated form of ad hominem than actual refutation.  For
example, correcting someone's grammar, or harping on minor mistakes
in names or numbers.  Unless the opposing argument actually depends
on such things, the only purpose of correcting them is to
discredit one's opponent.<br><br>Truly refuting something requires one to refute its central point,
or at least one of them.  And that means one has to commit explicitly
to what the central point is.  So a truly effective refutation would
look like:
<blockquote>
  The author's main point seems to be x.  As he says:
<blockquote>
    &lt;quotation&gt;
</blockquote>
  But this is wrong for the following reasons...
</blockquote>
The quotation you point out as mistaken need not be the actual
statement of the author's main point.  It's enough to refute something
it depends upon.<br><br>
<b>What It Means</b><br><br>Now we have a way of classifying forms of disagreement.  What good
is it?  One thing the disagreement hierarchy <i>doesn't</i> give us is
a way of picking a winner.  DH levels merely describe the form of
a statement, not whether it's correct.  A DH6 response could still
be completely mistaken.<br><br>But while DH levels don't set a lower bound on the convincingness
of a reply, they do set an upper bound.  A DH6 response might be
unconvincing, but a DH2 or lower response is always unconvincing.<br><br>The most obvious advantage of classifying the forms of disagreement
is that it will help people to evaluate what they read.  In particular,
it will help them to see through intellectually dishonest arguments.
An eloquent speaker or writer can give the impression of vanquishing
an opponent merely by using forceful words.  In fact that is probably
the defining quality of a demagogue.  By giving names to the different
forms of disagreement, we give critical readers a pin for popping
such balloons.<br><br>Such labels may help writers too.  Most intellectual dishonesty is
unintentional.  Someone arguing against the tone of something he
disagrees with may believe he's really saying something.  Zooming
out and seeing his current position on the disagreement hierarchy
may inspire him to try moving up to counterargument or refutation.<br><br>But the greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that it
will make conversations better, but that it will make the people
who have them happier.  If you study conversations, you find there
is a lot more meanness down in DH1 than up in DH6.  You don't have
to be mean when you have a real point to make.  In fact, you don't
want to.  If you have something real to say, being mean just gets
in the way.<br><br>If moving up the disagreement hierarchy makes people less mean,
that will make most of them happier.  Most people don't really enjoy
being mean; they do it because they can't help it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><div><div><div></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></div><div><br><br><div><h1 id="heroes">Some Heroes</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">April 2008<br><br>There are some topics I save up because they'll be so much fun to
write about.  This is one of them: a list of my heroes.<br><br>I'm not claiming this is a list of the <i>n</i> most admirable people.
Who could make such a list, even if they wanted to?<br><br>Einstein isn't on the list, for example, even though he probably
deserves to be on any shortlist of admirable people.  I once asked
a physicist friend if Einstein was really as smart as his fame
implies, and she said that yes, he was.  So why isn't he on the
list?  Because I had to ask.  This is a list of people who've
influenced me, not people who would have if I understood their work.<br><br>My test was to think of someone and ask "is this person my
hero?"  It often returned surprising answers.  For example,
it returned false for Montaigne, who was arguably the inventor of
the essay.  Why?  When I thought
about what it meant to call someone a hero, it meant I'd decide what
to do by asking what they'd do in the same situation.  That's a 
stricter standard than admiration.<br><br>After I made the list, I looked to see if there was a pattern, and
there was, a very clear one.  Everyone on the list had two qualities:
they cared almost excessively about their work, and they were
absolutely honest.  By honest I don't mean trustworthy so much as
that they never pander: they never say or do something because
that's what the audience wants.  They are all fundamentally subversive
for this reason, though they conceal it to varying degrees.<br><br>
<b>Jack Lambert</b><br><br>I grew up in Pittsburgh in the 1970s.  Unless you were there it's
hard to imagine how that town felt about the Steelers.   Locally,
all the news was bad.  The steel industry was dying.  But the
Steelers were the best team in football — and moreover, in a
way that seemed to reflect the personality of the city.  They didn't
do anything fancy.  They just got the job done.<br><br>Other players were more famous: Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, Lynn
Swann.  But they played offense, and you always get more attention
for that.  It seemed to me as a twelve year old football expert
that the best of them all was 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Lambert_(American_football_player)">Jack Lambert</a>.  And what made him so
good was that he was utterly relentless.  He didn't just care about
playing well; he cared almost too much.  He seemed to regard it as
a personal insult when someone from the other team had possession
of the ball on his side of the line of scrimmage.<br><br>The suburbs of Pittsburgh in the 1970s were a pretty dull place.
School was boring.  All the adults around were bored with their
jobs working for big companies. Everything that came to us through
the mass media was (a) blandly uniform and (b) produced elsewhere.
Jack Lambert was the exception.  He was like nothing else I'd seen.<br><br>
<b>Kenneth Clark</b><br><br>Kenneth Clark is the best nonfiction writer I know of, on any
subject.  Most people who write about art history don't really like
art; you can tell from a thousand little signs.  But Clark did, and
not just intellectually, but the way one anticipates a delicious
dinner.<br><br>What really makes him stand out, though, is the quality of his
ideas.  His style is deceptively casual, but there is more in 
his books than in a library
of art monographs.  Reading 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nude-Study-Ideal-Form/dp/0691017883"><i>The Nude</i></a> is like a ride in a
Ferrari.  Just as you're getting settled, you're slammed back in
your seat by the acceleration.  Before you can adjust, you're thrown
sideways as the car screeches into the first turn.  His brain throws
off ideas almost too fast to grasp them.  Finally at the end of the
chapter you come to a halt, with your eyes wide and a big smile on
your face.<br><br>Kenneth Clark was a star in his day, thanks to the documentary
series 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000F0UUKA"><i>Civilisation</i></a>.  And if you read only one book about
art history, 
<a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=clark&amp;sts=t&amp;tn=civilisation"><i>Civilisation</i></a> is the one I'd recommend.  It's
much better than the drab Sears Catalogs of art that undergraduates
are forced to buy for Art History 101.<br><br>
<b>Larry Mihalko</b><br><br>A lot of people have a great teacher at some point in their childhood.
Larry Mihalko was mine.  When I look back it's like there's a line
drawn between third and fourth grade.  After Mr. Mihalko, everything
was different.<br><br>Why?  First of all, he was intellectually curious.  I had a few
other teachers who were smart, but I wouldn't describe them as
intellectually curious.  In retrospect, he was out of place as an
elementary school teacher, and I think he knew it.  That must have
been hard for him, but it was wonderful for us, his students.  His
class was a constant adventure.  I used to like going to school
every day.<br><br>The other thing that made him different was that he liked us.  Kids
are good at telling that.  The other teachers were at best benevolently
indifferent.  But Mr.  Mihalko seemed like he actually wanted to
be our friend.  On the last day of fourth grade, he got out one of
the heavy school record players and played James Taylor's "You've
Got a Friend" to us.  Just call out my name, and you know wherever
I am, I'll come running.  He died at 59 of lung cancer.  I've never
cried like I cried at his funeral.<br><br>
<b>Leonardo</b><br><br>One of the things I've learned about making things that I didn't
realize when I was a kid is that much of the best stuff isn't made
for audiences, but for oneself.  You see paintings and drawings in
museums and imagine they were made for you to look at.  Actually a
lot of the best ones were made as a way of exploring the world, not
as a way to please other people.  The best of these explorations
are sometimes more pleasing than stuff made explicitly to please.<br><br>Leonardo did a lot of things.  One of his most admirable qualities
was that he did so many different things that were admirable.  What
people know of him now is his paintings and his more flamboyant
inventions, like flying machines.  That makes him seem like some
kind of dreamer who sketched artists' conceptions of rocket ships
on the side.  In fact he made a large number of far more practical
technical discoveries.  He was as good an engineer as a painter.<br><br>His most impressive work, to me, is his 
<a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/leonardo-skull.jpg?t=1688221954&amp;">drawings</a>.  They're clearly
made more as a way of studying the world than producing something
beautiful. And yet they can hold their own with any work of art
ever made.  No one else, before or since, was that good when no one
was looking.<br><br>
<b>Robert Morris</b><br><br>Robert Morris has a very unusual quality: he's never wrong.  It
might seem this would require you to be omniscient, but actually
it's surprisingly easy. Don't say anything unless you're fairly
sure of it.  If you're not omniscient, you just don't end up saying
much.<br><br>More precisely, the trick is to pay careful attention to how you
qualify what you say.  By using this trick, Robert has, as far as
I know, managed to be mistaken only once, and that was when he was
an undergrad.  When the Mac came out, he said that little desktop
computers would never be suitable for real hacking.<br><br>It's wrong to call it a trick in his case, though.  If it were a
conscious trick, he would have slipped in a moment of excitement.
With Robert this quality is wired-in.  He has an almost superhuman
integrity.  He's not just generally correct, but also correct about
how correct he is.<br><br>You'd think it would be such a great thing never to be wrong that
everyone would do this.  It doesn't seem like that much extra work
to pay as much attention to the error on an idea as to the idea
itself.  And yet practically no one does.  I know how hard it is,
because since meeting Robert I've tried to do in software what he
seems to do in hardware.<br><br>
<b>P. G. Wodehouse</b><br><br>People are finally starting to admit that Wodehouse was a great
writer.  If you want to be thought a great novelist in your own
time, you have to sound intellectual.  If what you write is popular,
or entertaining, or funny, you're ipso facto suspect.  That makes
Wodehouse doubly impressive, because it meant that to write as he
wanted to, he had to commit to being despised in his own lifetime.<br><br>Evelyn Waugh called him a great writer, but to most people at the
time that would have read as a chivalrous or deliberately perverse
gesture. At the time any random autobiographical novel by a recent
college grad could count on more respectful treatment from the
literary establishment.<br><br>Wodehouse may have begun with simple atoms, but the way he composed
them into molecules was near faultless.  His rhythm in particular.
It makes me self-conscious to write about it.  I can think of only
two other writers who came near him for style: Evelyn Waugh and
Nancy Mitford.  Those three used the English language like they
owned it.<br><br>But Wodehouse has something neither of them did.  He's at ease.
Evelyn Waugh and Nancy Mitford cared what other people thought of
them: he wanted to seem aristocratic; she was afraid she wasn't
smart enough.  But Wodehouse didn't give a damn what anyone thought
of him.  He wrote exactly what he wanted.<br><br>
<b>Alexander Calder</b><br><br>Calder's on this list because he makes me happy.  Can his work stand
up to Leonardo's?  Probably not.  There might not be anything from
the 20th Century that can.  But what was good about Modernism,
Calder had, and had in a way that he made seem effortless.<br><br>What was good about Modernism was its freshness.  Art became stuffy
in the nineteenth century.  The paintings that were popular at the
time were mostly the art equivalent of McMansions—big,
pretentious, and fake.  Modernism meant starting over, making things
with the same earnest motives that children might.  The artists who
benefited most from this were the ones who had preserved a child's
confidence, like Klee and Calder.<br><br>Klee was impressive because he could work in so many different
styles.  But between the two I like Calder better, because his work
seemed happier.  Ultimately the point of art is to engage the viewer.
It's hard to predict what will; often something that seems interesting
at first will bore you after a month.  Calder's 
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/uergevich/7029234689/">sculptures</a> never
get boring.  They just sit there quietly radiating optimism, like
a battery that never runs out.  As far as I can tell from books and
photographs, the happiness of Calder's work is his own happiness
showing through.<br><br>
<b>Jane Austen</b><br><br>Everyone admires Jane Austen.  Add my name to the list.  To me she
seems the best novelist of all time.<br><br>I'm interested in how things work.  When I read most novels, I pay
as much attention to the author's choices as to the story.  But in
her novels I can't see the gears at work.  Though I'd really like
to know how she does what she does, I can't figure it out, because
she's so good that her stories don't seem made up.  I feel like I'm
reading a description of something that actually happened.<br><br>I used to read a lot of novels when I was younger.  I can't read
most anymore, because they don't have enough information in them.
Novels seem so impoverished compared to history and biography.  But 
reading Austen is like reading
nonfiction.  She writes so well you don't even notice her.<br><br>
<b>John McCarthy</b><br><br>John McCarthy invented Lisp, the field of (or at least the term)
artificial intelligence, and was an early member of both of the top
two computer science departments, MIT and Stanford.  No one would
dispute that he's one of the greats, but he's an especial hero to
me because of 
<a href="rootsoflisp.html">Lisp</a>.<br><br>It's hard for us now to understand what a conceptual leap that was
at the time.  Paradoxically, one of the reasons his achievement is
hard to appreciate is that it was so successful.  Practically every
programming language invented in the last 20 years includes ideas
from Lisp, and each year the median language gets more Lisplike.<br><br>In 1958 these ideas were anything but obvious.  In 1958 there seem
to have been two ways of thinking about programming.  Some people
thought of it as math, and proved things about Turing Machines.
Others thought of it as a way to get things done, and designed
languages all too influenced by the technology of the day.  McCarthy
alone bridged the gap.  He designed a language that was math.  But
designed is not really the word; discovered is more like it.<br><br>
<b>The Spitfire</b><br><br>As I was making this list I found myself thinking of people like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Bader">Douglas Bader</a> 
and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._J._Mitchell">R.J. Mitchell</a>
 and 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spitfire-Pilots-Story-Crecy-Cover/dp/0947554726">Jeffrey Quill</a> and I realized
that though all of them had done many things in their lives, there
was one factor above all that connected them: the Spitfire.<br><br>This is supposed to be a list of heroes.  How can a machine be on
it?  Because that machine was not just a machine.  It was a lens
of heroes.  Extraordinary devotion went into it, and extraordinary
courage came out.<br><br>It's a cliche to call World War II a contest between good and evil,
but between fighter designs, it really was.  The Spitfire's original
nemesis, the ME 109, was a brutally practical plane.  It was a
killing machine.  The Spitfire was optimism embodied.  And not just
in its beautiful lines: it was at the edge of what could be
manufactured.  But taking the high road worked.  In the air, beauty
had the edge, just.<br><br>
<b>Steve Jobs</b><br><br>People alive when Kennedy was killed  usually remember exactly where
they were when they heard about it.  I remember exactly where I was
when a friend asked if I'd heard Steve Jobs had cancer.  It was
like the floor dropped out.   A few seconds later she told me that
it was a rare operable type, and that he'd be ok.  But those seconds
seemed long.<br><br>I wasn't sure whether to include Jobs on this list.  A lot of people
at Apple seem to be afraid of him, which is a bad sign.  But he
compels admiration.<br><br>There's no name for what Steve Jobs is, because there hasn't been
anyone quite like him before.  He doesn't design Apple's products
himself.  Historically the closest analogy to what he does are the
great Renaissance patrons of the arts.  As the CEO of a company,
that makes him unique.<br><br>Most CEOs delegate 
<a href="taste.html">taste</a> to a subordinate.
The 
<a href="gh.html">design paradox</a>
 means they're choosing more or less at random.  But Steve
Jobs actually has taste himself — such good taste that he's shown
the world how much more important taste is than they realized.<br><br>
<b>Isaac Newton</b><br><br>Newton has a strange role in my pantheon of heroes: he's the one I
reproach myself with.  He worked on big things, at least for part
of his life.  It's so easy to get distracted working on small stuff.
The questions you're answering are pleasantly familiar.  You get
immediate rewards — in fact, you get bigger rewards in your
time if you work on matters of passing importance.  But I'm
uncomfortably aware that this is the route to well-deserved obscurity.<br><br>To do really great things, you have to seek out questions people
didn't even realize were questions.  There have probably been other
people who did this as well as Newton, for their time, but Newton
is my model of this kind of thought.  I can just begin to understand
what it must have felt like for him.<br><br>You only get one life.  Why not do something huge?  The phrase "paradigm
shift" is overused now, but Kuhn was onto something.  And you know
more are out there, separated from us by what will later seem a
surprisingly thin wall of laziness and stupidity.  If we work like
Newton.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Jackie McDonough for reading drafts of this.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.aoky.net/articles/paul_graham/heroes.htm">Japanese Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

<p>
April 2008<br><br>Umair Haque 
<a href="http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/haque/2008/04/i_agree_and_i.html">wrote</a> recently that the reason there aren't more Googles is
that most startups get bought before they can change the world.
</p><blockquote>
  Google, despite serious interest from Microsoft and Yahoo—what
  must have seemed like lucrative interest at the time—didn't
  sell out. Google might simply have been nothing but Yahoo's or
  MSN's search box.<br><br>Why isn't it? Because Google had a deeply felt sense of purpose:
  a conviction to change the world for the better.
</blockquote>
This has a nice sound to it, but it isn't true. 
Google's founders were willing to sell early on.
They just wanted more than acquirers were willing to pay.<br><br>It was the same with Facebook.  They would have sold, but Yahoo blew it 
by offering too little.<br><br>Tip for acquirers: when a startup turns you down, consider raising
your offer, because there's a good chance the outrageous price they 
want will later seem a bargain. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>From the evidence I've seen so far,
startups that turn down acquisition offers usually end up doing better.  
Not always, but usually there's a bigger offer coming, or
perhaps even an IPO.<br><br>Of course, the reason startups do better when they turn down
acquisition offers is not necessarily that all such offers undervalue
startups.  More likely the reason is that the kind of founders who
have the balls to turn down a big offer also tend to be very
successful.  That spirit is exactly what you want in a startup.<br><br>While I'm sure Larry and Sergey do want to change the world, at
least now, the reason Google survived to become a big, independent
company is the same reason Facebook has so far remained independent:
acquirers underestimated them.<br><br>Corporate M&amp;A is a strange business in that respect.  They consistently
lose the best deals, because turning down reasonable offers is the
most reliable test you could invent for whether a startup will make
it big.<br><br><b>VCs</b><br><br>So what's the real reason there aren't more Googles?  Curiously
enough, it's the same reason Google and Facebook have remained
independent: money guys undervalue the most innovative startups.<br><br>The reason there aren't more Googles is not that investors encourage
innovative startups to sell out, but that they won't even fund them.
I've learned a lot about VCs during the 3 years we've been doing Y
Combinator, because we often have to work quite closely with them.
The most surprising thing I've learned is how conservative they
are.  VC firms present an image of boldly encouraging innovation.
Only a handful actually do, and even they are more conservative in
reality than you'd guess from reading their sites.<br><br>I used to think of VCs as piratical: bold but unscrupulous.  On
closer acquaintance they turn out to be more like bureaucrats.
They're more upstanding than I used to think (the good ones, at
least), but less bold.  Maybe the VC industry has changed.  Maybe
they used to be bolder.  
But I suspect it's the startup world that has
changed, not them.  The low cost of starting a startup means the
average good bet is a riskier one, but most existing VC firms still
operate as if they were investing in hardware startups in 1985.<br><br>Howard Aiken said "Don't worry about people stealing your ideas.
If your ideas are any good, you'll have to ram them down people's
throats." I have a similar feeling when I'm trying to convince VCs
to invest in startups Y Combinator has funded.  They're terrified
of really novel ideas, unless the founders are good enough salesmen
to compensate.<br><br>But it's the bold ideas that generate the biggest returns.  Any
really good new idea will seem bad to most people; otherwise someone
would already be doing it.  And
yet most VCs are driven by consensus, not just within their firms,
but within the VC community.  The biggest factor determining how a
VC will feel about your startup is how other VCs feel about it.  I
doubt they realize it, but this algorithm guarantees they'll miss
all the very best ideas.  The more people who have to like a new
idea, the more outliers you lose.<br><br>Whoever the next Google is, they're probably being told right now
by VCs to come back when they have more "traction."<br><br>Why are VCs so conservative?  It's probably a combination of factors.
The large size of their investments makes them conservative.
Plus they're investing other people's money, which makes
them worry they'll get in trouble if they do something risky and
it fails.  Plus most of them are money guys rather than technical
guys, so they don't understand what the startups they're investing
in do.<br><br><a name="next"><b>What's Next</b></a><br><br>The exciting thing about market economies is that stupidity equals
opportunity.  And so it is in this case.  There is a huge, unexploited
opportunity in startup investing.  Y Combinator funds startups at
the very beginning.  VCs will fund them once they're already starting
to succeed.  But between the two there is a substantial gap.<br><br>There are companies that will give $20k to a startup that has nothing
more than the founders, and there are companies that will give $2
million to a startup that's already taking off,
but there aren't enough investors who will give $200k to a startup
that seems very promising but still has some things to figure out.
This territory is occupied mostly by
individual angel investors—people like Andy Bechtolsheim, who
gave Google $100k when they seemed promising but still had some
things to figure out. I like angels, but there just aren't enough
of them, and investing is for most of them a part time job.<br><br>And yet as it gets cheaper to start startups, this sparsely occupied
territory is becoming more and more valuable.   Nowadays a lot of
startups don't want to raise multi-million dollar series A rounds.
They don't need that much money, and they don't want the hassles
that come with it.  The median startup coming out of Y Combinator
wants to raise $250-500k.  When they go to VC firms they have to
ask for more because they know VCs aren't interested in such small
deals.<br><br>VCs are money managers.  They're looking for ways to put large sums
to work.  But the startup world is evolving away from their current
model.<br><br>Startups have gotten cheaper.  That means they want less money, but
also that there are more of them.  So you can still get large returns
on large amounts of money; you just have to spread it more broadly.<br><br>I've tried to explain this to VC firms.  Instead of making one $2
million investment, make five $400k investments.  Would that mean
sitting on too many boards?  Don't sit on their boards.  Would that
mean too much due diligence?  Do less.  If you're investing at a
tenth the valuation, you only have to be a tenth as sure.<br><br>It seems obvious.  But I've proposed to several VC firms that they
set aside some money and designate one partner to make more, smaller
bets, and they react as if I'd proposed the partners all get nose
rings.  It's remarkable how wedded they are to their standard m.o.<br><br>But there is a big opportunity here, and one way or the other it's
going to get filled.  Either VCs will evolve down into this gap or,
more likely, new investors will appear to fill it.  That will be a
good thing when it happens, because these new investors will be
compelled by the structure of the investments they make to be ten
times bolder than present day VCs.  And that will get us a lot more
Googles.  At least, as long as acquirers remain stupid.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Another tip: If you want to get all that value, don't destroy the
startup after you buy it.  Give the founders enough autonomy that
they can grow the acquisition into what it would have become.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, David Hornik, Jessica

unimportant, but because it's so much easier than building something
great.<br><br>A couple weeks ago I realized that if you put those two ideas
together, you get something surprising.  Make something people want.
Don't worry too much about making money.  What you've got is a

bug or a new discovery.  Either businesses aren't supposed to be
like charities, and we've proven by reductio ad absurdum that one

idea.<br><br>I suspect it's the latter, because as soon as this thought occurred
to me, a whole bunch of other things fell into place.<br><br><b>Examples</b><br><br>For example, Craigslist.  It's not a charity, but they run it like
one.  And they're astoundingly successful.  When you scan down the
list of most popular web sites, the number of employees at Craigslist
looks like a misprint. Their revenues aren't as high as they could
be, but most startups would be happy to trade places with them.<br><br>In Patrick O'Brian's novels, his captains always try to get upwind
of their opponents.  If you're upwind, you decide when and if to
engage the other ship.  Craigslist is effectively upwind of enormous
revenues.  They'd face some challenges if they wanted to make more,
but not the sort you face when you're tacking upwind, trying to
force a crappy product on ambivalent users by spending ten times
as much on sales as on development.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>I'm not saying startups should aim to end up like Craigslist.
They're a product of unusual circumstances.  But they're a good
model for the early phases.<br><br>Google looked a lot like a charity in the beginning. They didn't
have ads for over a year.  At year 1, Google was indistinguishable
from a nonprofit.  If a nonprofit or government organization had
started a project to index the web, Google at year 1 is the limit
of what they'd have produced.<br><br>Back when I was working on spam filters I thought it would be a
good idea to have a web-based email service with good spam filtering.
I wasn't thinking of it as a company.  I just wanted to keep people
from getting spammed.  But as I thought more about this project, I
realized it would probably have to be a company.  It would cost
something to run, and it would be a pain to fund with grants and
donations.<br><br>That was a surprising realization.  Companies often claim to be
benevolent, but it was surprising to realize there were purely
benevolent projects that had to be embodied as companies to work.<br><br>I didn't want to start another company, so I didn't do it.  But if
someone had, they'd probably be quite rich now.  There was a window
of about two years when spam was increasing rapidly but all the big
email services had terrible filters.  If someone had launched a
new, spam-free mail service, users would have flocked to it.<br><br>Notice the pattern here?  From either direction we get to the same
spot.  If you start from successful startups, you find they often
behaved like nonprofits.  And if you start from ideas for nonprofits,
you find they'd often make good startups.<br><br><b>Power</b><br><br>How wide is this territory?  Would all good nonprofits be good
companies?  Possibly not.  What makes Google so valuable is that
their users have money.  If you make people with money love you,
you can probably get some of it.  But could you also base a successful
startup on behaving like a nonprofit to people who don't have money?
Could you, for example, grow a successful startup out of curing an
unfashionable but deadly disease like malaria?<br><br>I'm not sure, but I suspect that if you pushed this idea, you'd be
surprised how far it would go.  For example, people who apply to Y
Combinator don't generally have much money, and yet we can profit
by helping them, because with our help they could make money.  Maybe
the situation is similar with malaria.  Maybe an organization that
helped lift its weight off a country could benefit from the resulting
growth.<br><br>I'm not proposing this is a serious idea.  I don't know anything
about malaria.  But I've been kicking ideas around long enough to
know when I come across a powerful one.<br><br>One way to guess how far an idea extends is to ask yourself at what
point you'd bet against it.  The thought of betting against benevolence
is alarming in the same way as saying that something is technically
impossible.  You're just asking to be made a fool of, because these
are such powerful forces.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>For example, initially I thought maybe this principle only applied
to Internet startups.  Obviously it worked for Google, but what
about Microsoft?  Surely Microsoft isn't benevolent?  But when I
think back to the beginning, they were.  Compared to IBM they were
like Robin Hood.  When IBM introduced the PC, they thought they
were going to make money selling hardware at high prices.  But by
gaining control of the PC standard, Microsoft opened up the market
to any manufacturer.  Hardware prices plummeted, and lots of people
got to have computers who couldn't otherwise have afforded them.
It's the sort of thing you'd expect Google to do.<br><br>Microsoft isn't so benevolent now.  Now when one thinks of what
Microsoft does to users, all the verbs that come to mind begin with
F.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font> And yet it doesn't seem to pay.
Their stock price has been flat for years.  Back when they were
Robin Hood, their stock price rose like Google's.  Could there be
a connection?<br><br>You can see how there would be.  When you're small, you can't bully
customers, so you have to charm them.  Whereas when you're big you
can maltreat them at will, and you tend to, because it's easier
than satisfying them.  You grow big by being nice, but you can stay
big by being mean.<br><br>You get away with it till the underlying conditions change, and
then all your victims escape.  So "Don't be evil" may be the most
valuable thing Paul Buchheit made for Google, because it may turn
out to be an elixir of corporate youth.  I'm sure they find it
constraining, but think how valuable it will be if it saves them
from lapsing into the fatal laziness that afflicted Microsoft and
IBM.<br><br>The curious thing is, this elixir is freely available to any other
company.  Anyone can adopt "Don't be evil."  The catch is that
people will hold you to it.  So I don't think you're going to see
record labels or tobacco companies using this discovery.<br><br><b>Morale</b><br><br>There's a lot of external evidence that benevolence works.  But how
does it work?  One advantage of investing in a large number of
startups is that you get a lot of data about how they work.  From
what we've seen, being good seems to help startups in three ways:
it improves their morale, it makes other people want to help them,
and above all, it helps them be decisive.<br><br>Morale is tremendously important to a startup—so important
that morale alone is almost enough to determine success.  Startups
are often described as emotional roller-coasters. One minute you're
going to take over the world, and the next you're doomed.  The
problem with feeling you're doomed is not just that it makes you
unhappy, but that it makes you <i>stop working</i>.  So the downhills
of the roller-coaster are more of a self fulfilling prophecy than
the uphills.  If feeling you're going to succeed makes you work
harder, that probably improves your chances of succeeding, but if
feeling you're going to fail makes you stop working, that practically
guarantees you'll fail.<br><br>Here's where benevolence comes in.  If you feel you're really helping
people, you'll keep working even when it seems like your startup
is doomed.  Most of us have some amount of natural benevolence.
The mere fact that someone needs you makes you want to help them.
So if you start the kind of startup where users come back each day,
you've basically built yourself a giant tamagotchi.  You've made
something you need to take care of.<br><br>Blogger is a famous example of a startup that went through really
low lows and survived.  At one point they ran out of money and
everyone left. Evan Williams came in to work the next day, and there
was no one but him.  What kept him going?  Partly that users needed
him.  He was hosting thousands of people's blogs. He couldn't just
let the site die.<br><br>There are many advantages of launching quickly, but the most important
may be that once you have users, the tamagotchi effect kicks in.
Once you have users to take care of, you're forced to figure out
what will make them happy, and that's actually very valuable
information.<br><br>The added confidence that comes from trying to help people can
also help you with investors. One of the founders of 
<a href="http://chatterous.com">Chatterous</a> told 
me recently that he and his cofounder had decided that this service
was something the world needed, so they were going to keep working
on it no matter what, even if they had to move back to Canada and live
in their parents' basements.<br><br>Once they realized this, they stopped caring so much what investors thought
about them.  They still met with them, but they weren't going to
die if they didn't get their money.  And you know what?  The investors
got a lot more interested.  They could sense that the Chatterouses
were going to do this startup with or without them.<br><br>If you're really committed and your startup is cheap to run, you
become very hard to kill.  And practically all startups, even the
most successful, come close to death at some point.  So if doing
good for people gives you a sense of mission that makes you harder
to kill, that alone more than compensates for whatever you lose by
not choosing a more selfish project.<br><br><b>Help</b><br><br>Another advantage of being good is that it makes other people want
to help you.  This too seems to be an inborn trait in humans.<br><br>One of the startups we've funded, <a href="http://octopart.com">Octopart</a>, is currently locked in
a classic battle of good versus evil.  They're a search site for
industrial components.  A lot of people need to search for components,
and before Octopart there was no good way to do it.  That, it turned
out, was no coincidence.<br><br>Octopart built the right way to search for components.  Users like
it and they've been growing rapidly.  And yet for most of Octopart's
life, the biggest distributor, Digi-Key, has been trying to force
them take their prices off the site.  Octopart is sending them
customers for free, and yet Digi-Key is trying to make that traffic
stop.  Why?  Because their current business model depends on
overcharging people who have incomplete information about prices.
They don't want search to work.<br><br>The Octoparts are the nicest guys in the world.  They dropped out
of the PhD program in physics at Berkeley to do this.  They just
wanted to fix a problem they encountered in their research.  Imagine
how much time you could save the world's engineers if they could
do searches online.  So when I hear that a big, evil company is
trying to stop them in order to keep search broken, it makes me
really want to help them. It makes me spend more time on the Octoparts
than I do with most of the other startups we've funded.  It just
made me spend several minutes telling you how great they are.  Why?
Because they're good guys and they're trying to help the world.<br><br>If you're benevolent, people will rally around you: investors,
customers, other companies, and potential employees.  In the long
term the most important may be the potential employees.  I think
everyone knows now that 
<a href="gh.html">good hackers</a> are much better than mediocre
ones.  If you can attract the best hackers to work for you, as
Google has, you have a big advantage.  And the very best hackers
tend to be idealistic.  They're not desperate for a job.  They can
work wherever they want.  So most want to work on things that will
make the world better.<br><br><b>Compass</b><br><br>But the most important advantage of being good is that it acts as
a compass.  One of the hardest parts of doing a startup is that you
have so many choices.  There are just two or three of you, and a
thousand things you could do. How do you decide?<br><br>Here's the answer: Do whatever's best for your users.  You can hold
onto this like a rope in a hurricane, and it will save you if
anything can.  Follow it and it will take you through everything
you need to do.<br><br>It's even the answer to questions that seem unrelated, like how to
convince investors to give you money.  If you're a good salesman,
you could try to just talk them into it.  But the more reliable
route is to convince them through your users: if you make something
users love enough to tell their friends, you grow exponentially,
and that will convince any investor.<br><br>Being good is a particularly useful strategy for making decisions
in complex situations because it's stateless.  It's like telling
the truth.  The trouble with lying is that you have to remember
everything you've said in the past to make sure you don't contradict
yourself.  If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything,
and that's a really useful property in domains where things happen
fast.<br><br>For example, Y Combinator has now invested in 80 startups, 57 of
which are still alive.  (The rest have died or merged or been
acquired.)  When you're trying to advise 57 startups, it turns out
you have to have a stateless algorithm.  You can't have ulterior
motives when you have 57 things going on at once, because you can't
remember them.  So our rule is just to do whatever's best for the
founders.  Not because we're particularly benevolent, but because
it's the only algorithm that works on that scale.<br><br>When you write something telling people to be good, you seem to be
claiming to be good yourself.  So I want to say explicitly that I
am not a particularly good person.  When I was a kid I was firmly
in the camp of bad.  The way adults used the word good, it seemed
to be synonymous with quiet, so I grew up very suspicious of it.<br><br>You know how there are some people whose names come up in conversation
and everyone says "He's <i>such</i> a great guy?"  People never say
that about me.  The best I get is "he means well."  I am not claiming
to be good.  At best I speak good as a second language.<br><br>So I'm not suggesting you be good in the usual sanctimonious way.
I'm suggesting it because it works.  It will work not just as a
statement of "values," but as a guide to strategy,
and even a design spec for software.  Don't just not be evil.  Be
good.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] Fifty years ago
it would have seemed shocking for a public company not to pay
dividends.  Now many tech companies don't.  The markets seem to
have figured out how to value potential dividends.  Maybe that isn't
the last step in this evolution.  Maybe markets will eventually get
comfortable with potential earnings. (VCs already are, and at least
some of them consistently make money.)<br><br>I realize this sounds like the stuff one used to hear about the
"new economy" during the Bubble.  Believe me, I was not drinking
that kool-aid at the time.  But I'm convinced there were some 
<a href="bubble.html">good
ideas</a> buried in Bubble thinking.  For example, it's ok to focus on
growth instead of profits—but only if the growth is genuine.
You can't be buying users; that's a pyramid scheme.   But a company
with rapid, genuine growth is valuable, and eventually markets learn
how to value valuable things.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>] The idea of starting
a company with benevolent aims is currently undervalued, because
the kind of people who currently make that their explicit goal don't
usually do a very good job.<br><br>It's one of the standard career paths of trustafarians to start
some vaguely benevolent business.  The problem with most of them
is that they either have a bogus political agenda or are feebly
executed.  The trustafarians' ancestors didn't get rich by preserving
their traditional culture; maybe people in Bolivia don't want to
either.  And starting an organic farm, though it's at least
straightforwardly benevolent, doesn't help people on the scale that
Google does.<br><br>Most explicitly benevolent projects don't hold themselves sufficiently
accountable.  They act as if having good intentions were enough to
guarantee good effects.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>] Users dislike their
new operating system so much that they're starting petitions to
save the old one.  And the old one was nothing special.  The hackers
within Microsoft must know in their hearts that if the company
really cared about users they'd just advise them to switch to OSX.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston,

I'm not saying we should stop, but
I think we should at least examine which lies we tell and why.<br><br>There may also be a benefit to us.  We were all lied to as kids,
and some of the lies we were told still affect us.  So by studying
the ways adults lie to kids, we may be able to clear our heads of
lies we were told.<br><br>I'm using the word "lie" in a very general sense: not just overt
falsehoods, but also all the more subtle ways we mislead kids.
Though "lie" has negative connotations, I don't mean to suggest we
should never do this—just that we should pay attention when
we do.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>One of the most remarkable things about the way we lie to kids is
how broad the conspiracy is.  All adults know what their culture 
lies to kids about: they're the questions you answer "Ask
your parents."  If a kid asked who won the World Series in 1982
or what the atomic weight of carbon was, you could just tell him.
But if a kid asks you "Is there a God?" or "What's a prostitute?"
you'll probably say "Ask your parents."<br><br>Since we all agree, kids see few cracks in the view of the world
presented to them.  The biggest disagreements are between parents
and schools, but even those are small. Schools are careful what
they say about controversial topics, and if they do contradict what
parents want their kids to believe, parents either pressure the
school into keeping 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=parents+complain+inappropriate+book">quiet</a> or move their kids to a new school.<br><br>The conspiracy is so thorough that most kids who discover it do so
only by discovering internal contradictions in what they're told.
It can be traumatic for the ones who wake up during the operation.
Here's what happened to Einstein:
<blockquote>
  Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached
  the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not
  be true.  The consequence was a positively fanatic freethinking
  coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being
  deceived by the state through lies: it was a crushing impression.
  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
I remember that feeling.  By 15 I was convinced the world was corrupt
from end to end.  That's why movies like <i>The Matrix</i> have such
resonance.  Every kid grows up in a fake world.  In a way it would
be easier if the forces behind it were as clearly differentiated
as a bunch of evil machines, and one could make a clean break just by
taking a pill.<br><br>
<b>Protection</b><br><br>If you ask adults why they lie to kids, the most common reason they
give is to protect them.  And kids do need protecting.  The environment
you want to create for a newborn child will be quite unlike the
streets of a big city.<br><br>That seems so obvious it seems wrong to call it a lie.  It's certainly
not a bad lie to tell, to give a baby the impression the world is
quiet and warm and safe.  But this harmless type of lie can turn
sour if left unexamined.<br><br>Imagine if you tried to keep someone in as protected an environment
as a newborn till age 18.  To mislead someone so grossly about the
world would seem not protection but abuse.  That's an extreme
example, of course; when parents do that sort of thing it becomes
national news.  But you see the same problem on a smaller scale in
the malaise teenagers feel in suburbia.<br><br>The main purpose of suburbia is to provide a protected environment
for children to grow up in.  And it seems great for 10 year olds.
I liked living in suburbia when I was 10.  I didn't notice how
sterile it was.  My whole world was no bigger than a few friends'
houses I bicycled to and some woods I ran around in.  On a log scale
I was midway between crib and globe.  A suburban street was just
the right size.  But as I grew older, suburbia started to feel
suffocatingly fake.<br><br>Life can be pretty good at 10 or 20, but it's often frustrating at
15.  This is too big a problem to solve here, but certainly one
reason life sucks at 15 is that kids are trapped in a world designed
for 10 year olds.<br><br>What do parents hope to protect their children from by raising them
in suburbia?  A friend who moved out of Manhattan said merely that
her 3 year old daughter "saw too much."  Off the top of my head,
that might include: people who are high or drunk, poverty, madness,
gruesome medical conditions, sexual behavior of various degrees of
oddness, and violent anger.<br><br>I think it's the anger that would worry me most if I had a 3 year
old.  I was 29 when I moved to New York and I was surprised even
then.  I wouldn't want a 3 year old to see some of the disputes I
saw.  It would be too frightening.  A lot of the things adults
conceal from smaller children, they conceal because they'd be
frightening, not because they want to conceal the existence of such
things.  Misleading the child is just a byproduct.<br><br>This seems one of the most justifiable types of lying adults do to
kids.  But because the lies are indirect we don't keep a very strict
accounting of them.  Parents know they've concealed the facts about
sex, and many at some point sit their kids down and explain more.
But few tell their kids about the differences between the real world
and the cocoon they grew up in.  Combine this with the confidence
parents try to instill in their kids, and every year you get a new
crop of 18 year olds who think they know how to run the world.<br><br>Don't all 18 year olds think they know how to run the world?  Actually
this seems to be a recent innovation, no more than about 100 years old.
In preindustrial times teenage kids were junior members of the adult
world and comparatively well aware of their shortcomings.  They
could see they weren't as strong or skillful as the village smith.
In past times people lied to kids about some things more than we
do now, but the lies implicit in an artificial, protected environment
are a recent invention.  Like a lot of new inventions, the rich got
this first.  Children of kings and great magnates were the first
to grow up out of touch with the world.  Suburbia means half the
population can live like kings in that respect.<br><br>
<b>Sex (and Drugs)</b><br><br>I'd have different worries about raising teenage kids in New York.
I'd worry less about what they'd see, and more about what they'd
do.  I went to college with a lot of kids who grew up in Manhattan,
and as a rule they seemed pretty jaded.  They seemed to have lost
their virginity at an average of about 14 and by college had tried
more drugs than I'd even heard of.<br><br>The reasons parents don't want their teenage kids having sex are
complex.  There are some obvious dangers: pregnancy and sexually
transmitted diseases.  But those aren't the only reasons parents
don't want their kids having sex.  The average parents of a 14 year
old girl would hate the idea of her having sex even if there were
zero risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.<br><br>Kids can probably sense they aren't being told the whole story.
After all, pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases are just as
much a problem for adults, and they have sex.<br><br>What really bothers parents about their teenage kids having sex?
Their dislike of the idea is so visceral it's probably inborn.  But
if it's inborn it should be universal, and there are plenty of
societies where parents don't mind if their teenage kids have
sex—indeed, where it's normal for 14 year olds to become
mothers.  So what's going on?  There does seem to be a universal
taboo against sex with prepubescent children.  One can imagine
evolutionary reasons for that.  And I think this is the main reason
parents in industrialized societies dislike teenage kids having
sex.  They still think of them as children, even though biologically
they're not, so the taboo against child sex still has force.<br><br>One thing adults conceal about sex they also conceal about drugs:
that it can cause great pleasure.  That's what makes sex and drugs
so dangerous. The desire for them can cloud one's judgement—which
is especially frightening when the judgement being clouded is the
already wretched judgement of a teenage kid.<br><br>Here parents' desires conflict.  Older societies told kids they had
bad judgement, but modern parents want their children to be confident.
This may well be a better plan than the old one of putting them in
their place, but it has the side effect that after having implicitly
lied to kids about how good their judgement is, we then have to lie
again about all the things they might get into trouble with if they
believed us.<br><br>If parents told their kids the truth about sex and drugs, it would
be: the reason you should avoid these things is that you have lousy
judgement.  People with twice your experience still get burned by
them.  But this may be one of those cases where the truth wouldn't
be convincing, because one of the symptoms of bad judgement is
believing you have good judgement.  When you're too weak to lift
something, you can tell, but when you're making a decision impetuously,
you're all the more sure of it.<br><br>
<b>Innocence</b><br><br>Another reason parents don't want their kids having sex is that
they want to keep them innocent.  Adults have a certain model of
how kids are supposed to behave, and it's different from what they
expect of other adults.<br><br>One of the most obvious differences is the words kids are allowed
to use.  Most parents use words when talking to other adults that
they wouldn't want their kids using.  They try to hide even the
existence of these words for as long as they can.  And this is
another of those conspiracies everyone participates in: everyone
knows you're not supposed to swear in front of kids.<br><br>I've never heard more different explanations for anything parents
tell kids than why they shouldn't swear.  Every parent I know forbids
their children to swear, and yet no two of them have the same
justification.  It's clear most start with not wanting kids to
swear, then make up the reason afterward.<br><br>So my theory about what's going on is that the <i>function</i> of
swearwords is to mark the speaker as an adult.  There's no difference
in the meaning of "shit" and "poopoo."  So why should one be ok for
kids to say and one forbidden?  The only explanation is: by definition.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Why does it bother adults so much when kids do things reserved for
adults?   The idea of a foul-mouthed, cynical 10 year old leaning
against a lamppost with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of
his mouth is very disconcerting.  But why?<br><br>One reason we want kids to be innocent is that we're programmed to
like certain kinds of helplessness.  I've several times heard mothers
say they deliberately refrained from correcting their young children's
mispronunciations because they were so cute.  And if you think about
it, cuteness is helplessness. Toys and cartoon characters meant to
be cute always have clueless expressions and stubby, ineffectual
limbs.<br><br>It's not surprising we'd have an inborn desire to love and protect
helpless creatures, considering human offspring are so helpless for
so long.  Without the helplessness that makes kids cute, they'd be
very annoying.  They'd merely seem like incompetent adults.  But
there's more to it than that.  The reason our hypothetical jaded
10 year old bothers me so much is not just that he'd be annoying,
but that he'd have cut off his prospects for growth so early.  To
be jaded you have to think you know how the world works, and any
theory a 10 year old had about that would probably be a pretty
narrow one.<br><br>Innocence is also open-mindedness.  We want kids to be innocent so
they can continue to learn.  Paradoxical as it sounds, there are
some kinds of knowledge that get in the way of other kinds of
knowledge.  If you're going to learn that the world is a brutal
place full of people trying to take advantage of one another, you're
better off learning it last.  Otherwise you won't bother learning
much more.<br><br>Very smart adults often seem unusually innocent, and I don't think
this is a coincidence.  I think they've deliberately avoided learning
about certain things.  Certainly I do.  I used to think I wanted
to know everything.  Now I know I don't.<br><br>
<b>Death</b><br><br>After sex, death is the topic adults lie most conspicuously about
to kids.  Sex I believe they conceal because of deep taboos.  But
why do we conceal death from kids?   Probably because small children
are particularly horrified by it.  They want to feel safe, and death
is the ultimate threat.<br><br>One of the most spectacular lies our parents told us was about the
death of our first cat.  Over the years, as we asked for more
details, they were compelled to invent more, so the story grew quite
elaborate.  The cat had died at the vet's office.  Of what?  Of the
anaesthesia itself.  Why was the cat at the vet's office?  To be
fixed.  And why had such a routine operation killed it?  It wasn't
the vet's fault; the cat had a congenitally weak heart; the anaesthesia
was too much for it; but there was no way anyone could have
known this in advance.  It was not till we were in our twenties
that the truth came out: my sister, then about three, had accidentally
stepped on the cat and broken its back.<br><br>They didn't feel the need to tell us the cat was now happily in cat
heaven.  My parents never claimed that people or animals who died
had "gone to a better place," or that we'd meet them again.  It
didn't seem to harm us.<br><br>My grandmother told us an edited version of the death of my
grandfather.  She said they'd been sitting reading one day, and
when she said something to him, he didn't answer.  He seemed to be
asleep, but when she tried to rouse him, she couldn't.  "He was
gone." Having a heart attack sounded like falling asleep.  Later I
learned it hadn't been so neat, and the heart attack had taken most
of a day to kill him.<br><br>Along with such outright lies, there must have been a lot of changing
the subject when death came up.  I can't remember that, of course,
but I can infer it from the fact that I didn't really grasp I was
going to die till I was about 19.  How could I have missed something
so obvious for so long?  Now that I've seen parents managing the
subject, I can see how: questions about death are gently but firmly
turned aside.<br><br>On this topic, especially, they're met half-way by kids.  Kids often
want to be lied to.  They want to believe they're living in a
comfortable, safe world as much as their parents want them to believe
it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Identity</b><br><br>Some parents feel a strong adherence to an ethnic or religious group
and want their kids to feel it too.  This usually requires two
different kinds of lying: the first is to tell the child that he
or she is an X, and the second is whatever specific lies Xes
differentiate themselves by believing.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Telling a child they have a particular ethnic or religious identity
is one of the stickiest things you can tell them.  Almost anything
else you tell a kid, they can change their mind about later when
they start to think for themselves.  But if you tell a kid they're
a member of a certain group, that seems nearly impossible to shake.<br><br>This despite the fact that it can be one of the most premeditated
lies parents tell.  When parents are of different religions, they'll
often agree between themselves that their children will be "raised
as Xes."  And it works. The kids obligingly grow up considering
themselves as Xes, despite the fact that if their parents had chosen
the other way, they'd have grown up considering themselves as Ys.<br><br>One reason this works so well is the second kind of lie involved.
The truth is common property.  You can't distinguish your group by
doing things that are rational, and believing things that are true.
If you want to set yourself apart from other people, you have to
do things that are arbitrary, and believe things that are false.
And after having spent their whole lives doing things that are arbitrary
and believing things that are false, and being regarded as odd by
"outsiders" on that account, the cognitive dissonance pushing
children to regard themselves as Xes must be enormous.  If they
aren't an X, why are they attached to all these arbitrary beliefs
and customs?  If they aren't an X, why do all the non-Xes call them
one?<br><br>This form of lie is not without its uses.  You can use it to carry
a payload of beneficial beliefs, and they will also become part of
the child's identity.  You can tell the child that in addition to
never wearing the color yellow, believing the world was created by
a giant rabbit, and always snapping their fingers before eating
fish, Xes are also particularly honest and industrious.  Then X
children will grow up feeling it's part of their identity to be
honest and industrious.<br><br>This probably accounts for a lot of the spread of modern religions,
and explains why their doctrines are a combination of the useful
and the bizarre.  The bizarre half is what makes the religion stick,
and the useful half is the payload.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Authority</b><br><br>One of the least excusable reasons adults lie to kids is to maintain
power over them.  Sometimes these lies are truly sinister, like a
child molester telling his victims they'll get in trouble if they
tell anyone what happened to them.  Others seem more innocent; it
depends how badly adults lie to maintain their power, and what they
use it for.<br><br>Most adults make some effort to conceal their flaws from children.
Usually their motives are mixed.  For example, a father who has an
affair generally conceals it from his children.  His motive is
partly that it would worry them, partly that this would introduce
the topic of sex, and partly (a larger part than he would admit)
that he doesn't want to tarnish himself in their eyes.<br><br>If you want to learn what lies are told to kids, read almost any
book written to teach them about "issues."
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
Peter Mayle wrote
one called <i>Why Are We Getting a Divorce?</i>  It begins with the three
most important things to remember about divorce, one of which is:
<blockquote>
  You shouldn't put the blame on one parent, because divorce is
  never only one person's fault.
  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
Really?  When a man runs off with his secretary, is it always partly
his wife's fault?  But I can see why Mayle might have said this.
Maybe it's more important for kids to respect their parents than
to know the truth about them.<br><br>But because adults conceal their flaws, and at the same time insist
on high standards of behavior for kids, a lot of kids grow up feeling
they fall hopelessly short.  They walk around feeling horribly evil
for having used a swearword, while in fact most of the adults around
them are doing much worse things.<br><br>This happens in intellectual as well as moral questions.  The more
confident people are, the more willing they seem to be to answer a
question "I don't know."  Less confident people feel they have to
have an answer or they'll look bad.  My parents were pretty good
about admitting when they didn't know things, but I must have been
told a lot of lies of this type by teachers, because I rarely heard
a teacher say "I don't know" till I got to college.  I remember
because it was so surprising to hear someone say that in front of
a class.<br><br>The first hint I had that teachers weren't omniscient came in sixth
grade, after my father contradicted something I'd learned in school.
When I protested that the teacher had said the opposite, my father
replied that the guy had no idea what he was talking about—that
he was just an elementary school teacher, after all.<br><br><i>Just</i> a teacher?  The phrase seemed almost grammatically ill-formed.
Didn't teachers know everything about the subjects they taught?
And if not, why were they the ones teaching us?<br><br>The sad fact is, US public school teachers don't generally understand
the stuff they're teaching very well.  There are some sterling
exceptions, but as a rule people planning to go into teaching rank
academically near the bottom of the college population.  So the
fact that I still thought at age 11 that teachers were infallible
shows what a job the system must have done on my brain.<br><br>
<b>School</b><br><br>What kids get taught in school is a complex mix of lies.  The most
excusable are those told to simplify ideas to make them easy to
learn.  The problem is, a lot of propaganda gets slipped into the
curriculum in the name of simplification.<br><br>Public school textbooks represent a compromise between what various
powerful groups want kids to be told.  The lies are rarely overt.
Usually they consist either of omissions or of over-emphasizing
certain topics at the expense of others.  The view of history we
got in elementary school was a crude hagiography, with at least one
representative of each powerful group.<br><br>The famous scientists I remember were Einstein, Marie Curie, and
George Washington Carver.   Einstein was a big deal because his
work led to the atom bomb.  Marie Curie was involved with X-rays.
But I was mystified about Carver.  He seemed to have done stuff
with peanuts.<br><br>It's obvious now that he was on the list because he was black (and
for that matter that Marie Curie was on it because she was a woman),
but as a kid I was confused for years about him.  I wonder if it
wouldn't have been better just to tell us the truth: that there
weren't any famous black scientists.  Ranking George Washington
Carver with Einstein misled us not only about science, but about
the obstacles blacks faced in his time.<br><br>As subjects got softer, the lies got more frequent.  By the time
you got to politics and recent history, what we were taught was
pretty much pure propaganda.  For example, we were taught to regard
political leaders as saints—especially the recently martyred
Kennedy and King.  It was astonishing to learn later that they'd
both been serial womanizers, and that Kennedy was a speed freak to
boot.  (By the time King's plagiarism emerged, I'd lost the ability
to be surprised by the misdeeds of famous people.)<br><br>I doubt you could teach kids recent history without teaching them
lies, because practically everyone who has anything to say about
it has some kind of spin to put on it.  Much recent history <i>consists</i>
of spin.  It would probably be better just to teach them metafacts
like that.<br><br>Probably the biggest lie told in schools, though, is that the way
to succeed is through following "the rules."  In fact most such
rules are just hacks to manage large groups efficiently.<br><br>
<b>Peace</b><br><br>Of all the reasons we lie to kids, the most powerful is probably
the same mundane reason they lie to us.<br><br>Often when we lie to people it's not part of any conscious strategy,
but because they'd react violently to the truth.  Kids, almost by
definition, lack self-control.  They react violently to things—and
so they get lied to a lot. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>A few Thanksgivings ago, a friend of mine found himself in a situation
that perfectly illustrates the complex motives we have when we lie
to kids.  As the roast turkey appeared on the table, his alarmingly
perceptive 5 year old son suddenly asked if the turkey had wanted
to die.  Foreseeing disaster, my friend and his wife rapidly
improvised: yes, the turkey had wanted to die, and in fact had lived
its whole life with the aim of being their Thanksgiving dinner.
And that (phew) was the end of that.<br><br>Whenever we lie to kids to protect them, we're usually also lying
to keep the peace.<br><br>One consequence of this sort of calming lie is that we grow up
thinking horrible things are normal.  It's hard for us to feel a
sense of urgency as adults over something we've literally been
trained not to worry about.  When I was about 10 I saw a documentary
on pollution that put me into a panic.  It seemed the planet was
being irretrievably ruined.  I went to my mother afterward to ask
if this was so.  I don't remember what she said, but she made me
feel better, so I stopped worrying about it.<br><br>That was probably the best way to handle a frightened 10 year old.
But we should understand the price.  This sort of lie is one of the
main reasons bad things persist: we're all trained to ignore them.<br><br>
<b>Detox</b><br><br>A sprinter in a race almost immediately enters a state called "oxygen
debt."  His body switches to an emergency source of energy that's
faster than regular aerobic respiration.  But this process builds
up waste products that ultimately require extra oxygen to break
down, so at the end of the race he has to stop and pant for a while
to recover.<br><br>We arrive at adulthood with a kind of truth debt.  We were told a
lot of lies to get us (and our parents) through our childhood.  Some
may have been necessary.  Some probably weren't.  But we all arrive
at adulthood with heads full of lies.<br><br>There's never a point where the adults sit you down and explain all
the lies they told you.  They've forgotten most of them.  So if
you're going to clear these lies out of your head, you're going to
have to do it yourself.<br><br>Few do.  Most people go through life with bits of packing material
adhering to their minds and never know it.  You probably never can
completely undo the effects of lies you were told as a kid, but
it's worth trying.  I've found that whenever I've been able to undo
a lie I was told, a lot of other things fell into place.<br><br>Fortunately, once you arrive at adulthood you get a valuable new
resource you can use to figure out what lies you were told.  You're
now one of the liars.  You get to watch behind the scenes as adults
spin the world for the next generation of kids.<br><br>The first step in clearing your head is to realize how far you are
from a neutral observer.  When I left high school I was, I thought,
a complete skeptic.  I'd realized high school was crap.  I thought
I was ready to question everything I knew.  But among the many other
things I was ignorant of was how much debris there already was in
my head.  It's not enough to consider your mind a blank slate.  You
have to consciously erase it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
One reason I stuck with such a brutally simple word is that
the lies we tell kids are probably not quite as harmless as we
think.  If you look at what adults told children in the past, it's
shocking how much they lied to them.  Like us, they did it with the
best intentions.  So if we think we're as open as one could reasonably
be with children, we're probably fooling ourselves.  Odds are people
in 100 years will be as shocked at some of the lies we tell as we
are at some of the lies people told 100 years ago.<br><br>I can't predict which these will be, and I don't want to write an
essay that will seem dumb in 100 years.  So instead of using special
euphemisms for lies that seem excusable according to present fashions,
I'm just going to call all our lies lies.<br><br>(I have omitted one type: lies told to play games with kids'
credulity.  These range from "make-believe," which is not really a
lie because it's told with a wink, to the frightening lies told by
older siblings.   There's not much to say about these: I wouldn't
want the first type to go away, and wouldn't expect the second type
to.)<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]

If you ask parents why kids shouldn't swear, the less educated
ones usually reply with some question-begging answer like "it's
inappropriate," while the more educated ones come up with elaborate
rationalizations.  In fact the less educated parents seem closer
to the truth.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
As a friend with small children pointed out, it's easy for small
children to consider themselves immortal, because time seems to
pass so slowly for them.  To a 3 year old, a day feels like a month
might to an adult.  So 80 years sounds to him like 2400 years would
to us.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
I realize I'm going to get endless grief for classifying religion
as a type of lie.  Usually people skirt that issue with some
equivocation implying that lies believed for a sufficiently long
time by sufficiently large numbers of people are immune to the usual
standards for truth.  But because I can't predict which lies future
generations will consider inexcusable, I can't safely omit any type
we tell.  Yes, it seems unlikely that religion will be out of fashion
in 100 years, but no more unlikely than it would have seemed to
someone in 1880 that schoolchildren in 1980 would be taught that
masturbation was perfectly normal and not to feel guilty about it.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Unfortunately the payload can consist of bad customs as well
as good ones.  For example, there are certain qualities that some
groups in America consider "acting white."  In fact most of them
could as accurately be called "acting Japanese."  There's nothing
specifically white about such customs. They're common to all cultures
with long traditions of living in cities.  So it is probably a
losing bet for a group to consider behaving the opposite way as
part of its identity.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
In this context, "issues" basically means "things we're going
to lie to them about."  That's why there's a special name for these
topics.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]

The ironic thing is, this is also the main reason kids lie to
adults.  If you freak out when people tell you alarming things,
they won't tell you them.  Teenagers don't tell their parents what
happened that night they were supposed to be staying at a friend's
house for the same reason parents don't tell 5 year olds the truth
about the Thanksgiving turkey.  They'd freak if they knew.<br><br>

It would work for a while, and then I'd gradually find myself
using the Internet on my work computer.  I'm trying other
strategies now, but I think this time I'll wait till I'm sure
they work before writing about them.</i><br><br>May 2008<br><br>Procrastination feeds on distractions.  Most people find it
uncomfortable just to sit and do nothing; you avoid work by doing
something else.<br><br>So one way to beat procrastination is to starve it of distractions.
But that's not as straightforward as it sounds, because there are
people working hard to distract you.  Distraction is not a static
obstacle that you avoid like you might avoid a rock in the road.
Distraction seeks you out.<br><br>Chesterfield described dirt as matter out of place.  Distracting
is, similarly, desirable at the wrong time.  And technology is
continually being refined to produce more and more desirable things.
Which means that as we learn to avoid one class of distractions,
new ones constantly appear, like drug-resistant bacteria.<br><br>Television, for example, has after 50 years of refinement reached
the point where it's like visual crack.  I realized when I was 13
that TV was addictive, so I stopped watching it.  But I read recently
 that the average American watches 
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/0929/076.html">4 hours</a> 
of TV a day.  A quarter
of their life.<br><br>TV is in decline now, but only because people have found even more
addictive ways of wasting time.  And what's especially dangerous
is that many happen at your computer.  This is no accident.  An
ever larger percentage of office workers sit in front of computers
connected to the Internet, and distractions always evolve toward
the procrastinators.<br><br>I remember when computers were, for me at least, exclusively for
work.  I might occasionally dial up a server to get mail or ftp
files, but most of the time I was offline.  All I could do was write
and program.  Now I feel as if someone snuck a television onto my
desk.  Terribly addictive things are just a click away.  Run into
an obstacle in what you're working on?  Hmm, I wonder what's new
online.  Better check.<br><br>After years of carefully avoiding classic time sinks like TV, games,
and Usenet, I still managed to fall prey to distraction, because
I didn't realize that it evolves.  Something that used to be safe,
using the Internet, gradually became more and more dangerous.  Some
days I'd wake up, get a cup of tea and check the news, then check
email, then check the news again, then answer a few emails, then
suddenly notice it was almost lunchtime and I hadn't gotten any real
work done.  And this started to happen more and more often.<br><br>It took me surprisingly long to realize how distracting the Internet
had become, because the problem was intermittent.  I ignored it the
way you let yourself ignore a bug that only appears intermittently.  When
I was in the middle of a project, distractions weren't really a
problem.  It was when I'd finished one project and was deciding
what to do next that they always bit me.<br><br>Another reason it was hard to notice the danger of this new type
of distraction was that social customs hadn't yet caught up with
it.  If I'd spent a whole morning sitting on a sofa watching TV,
I'd have noticed very quickly.  That's a known danger sign, like
drinking alone.  But using the Internet still looked and felt a 
lot like work.<br><br>Eventually, though, it became clear that the Internet had become so much
more distracting that I had to start treating it differently.
Basically, I had to add a new application to my list of known time
sinks: Firefox.<br><br><center>* * *</center><br><br>The problem is a hard one to solve because most people still need
the Internet for some things.  If you drink too much, you can solve
that problem by stopping entirely.  But you can't solve the problem
of overeating by stopping eating.  I couldn't simply avoid the 
Internet entirely, as I'd done with previous time sinks.<br><br>At first I tried rules.  For example, I'd tell myself I was only
going to use the Internet twice a day.  But these schemes never
worked for long.  Eventually something would come up that required
me to use it more than that.  And then I'd gradually slip back
into my old ways.<br><br>Addictive things have to be treated as if they were sentient
adversaries—as if there were a little man in your head always
cooking up the most plausible arguments for doing whatever you're
trying to stop doing.  If you leave a path to it, he'll find it.<br><br>The key seems to be visibility.  The biggest ingredient in most bad habits
is denial.  So you have to make it so that you can't merely <i>slip</i>
into doing the thing you're trying to avoid.  It has to set off
alarms.<br><br>Maybe in the long term the right answer for dealing with Internet
distractions will be 
<a href="http://rescuetime.com">software</a> that watches and controls them.  But
in the meantime I've found a more drastic solution that definitely
works: to set up a separate computer for using the Internet.<br><br>I now leave wifi turned off on my main computer except when I need
to transfer a file or edit a web page, and I have a separate laptop 
on the other side
of the room that I use to check mail or browse the web.  (Irony of
ironies, it's the computer Steve Huffman wrote Reddit on.  When
Steve and Alexis auctioned off their old laptops for charity, I
bought them for the Y Combinator museum.)<br><br>My rule is that I can spend as much time online as I want, as long
as I do it on that computer.  And this turns out to be enough.  When
I have to sit on the other side of the room to check email or browse
the web, I become much more aware of it.  Sufficiently aware, in
my case at least, that it's hard to spend more than about an hour
a day online.<br><br>And my main computer is now freed for work.  If you try this trick,
you'll probably be struck by how different it feels when your
computer is disconnected from the Internet.  It was alarming to me
how foreign it felt to sit in front of a computer that could
only be used for work, because that showed how much time I must
have been wasting.<br><br><i>Wow.  All I can do at this computer is work.  Ok, I better work
then.</i><br><br>That's the good part.  Your old bad habits now help you to work.
You're used to sitting in front of that computer for hours at a
time.   But you can't browse the web or check email now.  What are
you going to do?  You can't just sit there.  So you start working.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html">Good and Bad Procrastination</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://wiki.alsanan.info/index.php?nom=desconectar%20las%20distracciones">Spanish Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://blog.amr-g.com/?p=11">Arabic Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://capalfar.wordpress.com/2008/05/20/traduccions-de-paul-graham-2-disconnecting-distraction/">Catalan Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://ryba4.com/translations/distraction">Russian Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.internazionale.it/interblog/index.php?itemid=2579">Spanish Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

Great cities attract ambitious people.  You can sense it when you
walk around one.  In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you a
message: you could do more; you should try harder.<br><br>The surprising thing is how different these messages can be.  New
York tells you, above all: you should make more money.  There are
other messages too, of course.  You should be hipper.  You should
be better looking.  But the clearest message is that you should be
richer.<br><br>What I like about Boston (or rather Cambridge) is that the message
there is: you should be smarter.  You really should get around to
reading all those books you've been meaning to.<br><br>When you ask what message a city sends, you sometimes get surprising
answers.  As much as they respect brains in Silicon Valley, the
message the Valley sends is: you should be more powerful.<br><br>That's not quite the same message New York sends.  Power matters
in New York too of course, but New York is pretty impressed by a
billion dollars even if you merely inherited it.  In Silicon Valley
no one would care except a few real estate agents.  What matters
in Silicon Valley is how much effect you have on the world.  The
reason people there care about Larry and Sergey is not their wealth
but the fact that they control Google, which affects practically
everyone.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>How much does it matter what message a city sends?  Empirically,
the answer seems to be: a lot. You might think that if you had
enough strength of mind to do great things, you'd be able to transcend
your environment.  Where you live should make at most a couple
percent difference.  But if you look at the historical evidence,
it seems to matter more than that.  Most people who did great things
were clumped together in a few places where that sort of thing was
done at the time.<br><br>You can see how powerful cities are from something I wrote about
<a href="taste.html">earlier</a>: the case of the Milanese Leonardo.  
Practically every
fifteenth century Italian painter you've heard of was from Florence,
even though Milan was just as big.  People in Florence weren't
genetically different, so you have to assume there was someone born
in Milan with as much natural ability as Leonardo.  What happened
to him?<br><br>If even someone with the same natural ability as Leonardo
couldn't beat the force of environment, do you suppose you can?<br><br>I don't.  I'm fairly stubborn, but I wouldn't try to fight this
force.  I'd rather use it.  So I've thought a lot about where to
live.<br><br>I'd always imagined Berkeley would be the ideal place — that
it would basically be Cambridge with good weather.  But when I
finally tried living there a couple years ago, it turned out not
to be.  The message Berkeley sends is: you should live better.  Life
in Berkeley is very civilized.  It's probably the place in America
where someone from Northern Europe would feel most at home.  But
it's not humming with ambition.<br><br>In retrospect it shouldn't have been surprising that a place so
pleasant would attract people interested above all in quality of
life.  Cambridge with good weather, it turns out, is not Cambridge.
The people you find in Cambridge are not there by accident.  You
have to make sacrifices to live there.  It's expensive and somewhat
grubby, and the weather's often bad.  So the kind of people you
find in Cambridge are the kind of people who want to live where the
smartest people are, even if that means living in an expensive,
grubby place with bad weather.<br><br>As of this writing, Cambridge seems to be the intellectual capital
of the world.  I realize that seems a preposterous claim.  What
makes it true is that it's more preposterous to claim about anywhere
else.  American universities currently seem to be the best, judging
from the flow of ambitious students.  And what US city has a stronger
claim?  New York?  A fair number of smart people, but diluted by a
much larger number of neanderthals in suits.  The Bay Area has a
lot of smart people too, but again, diluted;  there are two great
universities, but they're far apart.  Harvard and MIT are practically
adjacent by West Coast standards, and they're surrounded by about
20 other colleges and universities.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Cambridge as a result feels like a town whose main industry is
ideas, while New York's is finance and Silicon Valley's is startups.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>When you talk about cities in the sense we are, what you're really
talking about is collections of people.  For a long time cities
were the only large collections of people, so you could use the two
ideas interchangeably.  But we can see how much things are changing
from the examples I've mentioned.  New York is a classic great city.
But Cambridge is just part of a city, and Silicon Valley is not
even that.  (San Jose is not, as it sometimes claims, the capital
of Silicon Valley.  It's just 178 square miles at one end of it.)<br><br>Maybe the Internet will change things further.  Maybe one day the
most important community you belong to will be a virtual one, and
it won't matter where you live physically.  But I wouldn't bet on
it.  The physical world is very high bandwidth, and some of the
ways cities send you messages are quite subtle.<br><br>One of the exhilarating things about coming back to Cambridge every
spring is walking through the streets at dusk, when you can see
into the houses.  When you walk through Palo Alto in the evening,
you see nothing but the blue glow of TVs.  In Cambridge you see
shelves full of promising-looking books.  Palo Alto was probably
much like Cambridge in 1960, but you'd never guess now that there
was a university nearby.  Now it's just one of the richer neighborhoods
in Silicon Valley. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>A city speaks to you mostly by accident — in things you see
through windows, in conversations you overhear.  It's not something
you have to seek out, but something you can't turn off.  One of the
occupational hazards of living in Cambridge is overhearing the
conversations of people who use interrogative intonation in declarative
sentences.  But on average I'll take Cambridge conversations over
New York or Silicon Valley ones.<br><br>A friend who moved to Silicon Valley in the late 90s said the worst
thing about living there was the low quality of the eavesdropping.
At the time I thought she was being deliberately eccentric. Sure,
it can be interesting to eavesdrop on people, but is good quality
eavesdropping so important that it would affect where you chose to
live?  Now I understand what she meant.  The conversations you
overhear tell you what sort of people you're among.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>No matter how determined you are, it's hard not to be influenced
by the people around you.  It's not so much that you do whatever a
city expects of you, but that you get discouraged when no one around
you cares about the same things you do.<br><br>There's an imbalance between encouragement and discouragement like
that between gaining and losing money.  Most people overvalue
negative amounts of money: they'll work much harder to avoid losing
a dollar than to gain one.  Similarly, although there are plenty of
people strong enough to resist doing something just because that's
what one is supposed to do where they happen to be, there are few
strong enough to keep working on something no one around them cares
about.<br><br>Because ambitions are to some extent incompatible and admiration
is a zero-sum game, each city tends to focus on one type of ambition.
The reason Cambridge is the intellectual capital is not just that
there's a concentration of smart people there, but that there's
nothing <i>else</i> people there care about more.  Professors in
New York and the Bay area are second class citizens — till they
start hedge funds or startups respectively.<br><br>This suggests an answer to a question people in New York have
wondered about since the Bubble: whether New York could grow into
a startup hub to rival Silicon Valley.  One reason that's unlikely
is that someone starting a startup in New York would feel like a
second class citizen. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
There's already something else people in New York admire more.<br><br>In the long term, that could be a bad thing for New York.  The power
of an important new technology does eventually convert to money.
So by caring more about money and less about power than Silicon
Valley, New York is recognizing the same thing, but slower.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
And in fact it has been losing to Silicon Valley at its own game:
the ratio of New York to California residents in the Forbes 400 has
decreased from 1.45 (81:56) when the list was first published in
1982 to .83 (73:88) in 2007.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Not all cities send a message.  Only those that are centers for
some type of ambition do.  And it can be hard to tell exactly what
message a city sends without living there.  I understand the messages
of New York, Cambridge, and Silicon Valley because I've lived for
several years in each of them.  DC and LA seem to send messages
too, but I haven't spent long enough in either to say for sure what
they are.<br><br>The big thing in LA seems to be fame.  There's an A List of people
who are most in demand right now, and what's most admired is to be
on it, or friends with those who are.  Beneath that, the message is
much like New York's, though perhaps with more emphasis on physical
attractiveness.<br><br>In DC the message seems to be that the most important thing is who
you know.  You want to be an insider.  In practice this seems to
work much as in LA.  There's an A List and you want to be on it or
close to those who are.  The only difference is how the A List is
selected.  And even that is not that different.<br><br>At the moment, San Francisco's message seems to be the same as
Berkeley's: you should live better.  But this will change if enough
startups choose SF over the Valley.  During the Bubble that was a
predictor of failure — a self-indulgent choice, like buying
expensive office furniture.  Even now I'm suspicious when startups
choose SF.  But if enough good ones do, it stops being a self-indulgent
choice, because the center of gravity of Silicon Valley will shift
there.<br><br>I haven't found anything like Cambridge for intellectual ambition.
Oxford and Cambridge (England) feel like Ithaca or Hanover: the
message is there, but not as strong.<br><br>Paris was once a great intellectual center.  If you went there in
1300, it might have sent the message Cambridge does now.  But I
tried living there for a bit last year, and the ambitions of the
inhabitants are not intellectual ones.  The message Paris sends now
is: do things with style.  I liked that, actually.  Paris is the
only city I've lived in where people genuinely cared about art.  In
America only a few rich people buy original art, and even the more
sophisticated ones rarely get past judging it by the brand name of
the artist.  But looking through windows at dusk in Paris you can
see that people there actually care what paintings look like.
Visually, Paris has the best eavesdropping I know. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>There's one more message I've heard from cities: in London you can
still (barely) hear the message that one should be more aristocratic.
If you listen for it you can also hear it in Paris, New York, and
Boston.  But this message is everywhere very faint.  It would have
been strong 100 years ago, but now I probably wouldn't have picked
it up at all if I hadn't deliberately tuned in to that wavelength
to see if there was any signal left.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>So far the complete list of messages I've picked up from cities is:
wealth, style, hipness, physical attractiveness, fame, political
power, economic power, intelligence, social class, and quality of
life.<br><br>My immediate reaction to this list is that it makes me slightly
queasy.  I'd always considered ambition a good thing, but I realize
now that was because I'd always implicitly understood it to mean
ambition in the areas I cared about.  When you list everything
ambitious people are ambitious about, it's not so pretty.<br><br>On closer examination I see a couple things on the list that are
surprising in the light of history.  For example, physical
attractiveness wouldn't have been there 100 years ago (though it
might have been 2400 years ago).  It has always mattered for women,
but in the late twentieth century it seems to have started to matter
for men as well.  I'm not sure why — probably some combination
of the increasing power of women, the increasing influence of actors
as models, and the fact that so many people work in offices now:
you can't show off by wearing clothes too fancy to wear in a factory,
so you have to show off with your body instead.<br><br>Hipness is another thing you wouldn't have seen on the list 100
years ago.  Or wouldn't you?  What it means is to know what's what.
So maybe it has simply replaced the component of social class that
consisted of being "au fait."  That could explain why hipness seems
particularly admired in London: it's version 2 of the traditional
English delight in obscure codes that only insiders understand.<br><br>Economic power would have been on the list 100 years ago, but what
we mean by it is changing.  It used to mean the control of vast
human and material resources.  But increasingly it means the ability
to direct the course of technology, and some of the people in a
position to do that are not even rich — leaders of important
open source projects, for example.  The Captains of Industry of
times past had laboratories full of clever people cooking up new
technologies for them.  The new breed are themselves those people.<br><br>As this force gets more attention, another is dropping off the list:
social class.  I think the two changes are related.  Economic power,
wealth, and social class are just names for the same thing at
different stages in its life: economic power converts to wealth,
and wealth to social class.  So the focus of admiration is simply
shifting upstream.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Does anyone who wants to do great work have to live in a great city?
No; all great cities inspire some sort of ambition, but they aren't
the only places that do.  For some kinds of work, all you need is
a handful of talented colleagues.<br><br>What cities provide is an audience, and a funnel for peers.  These
aren't so critical in something like math or physics, where no
audience matters except your peers, and judging ability is sufficiently
straightforward that hiring and admissions committees can do it
reliably.  In a field like math or physics all you need is a
department with the right colleagues in it.  It could be anywhere — in
Los Alamos, New Mexico, for example.<br><br>It's in fields like the arts or writing or technology that the
larger environment matters.  In these the best practitioners aren't
conveniently collected in a few top university departments and
research labs — partly because talent is harder to judge, and
partly because people pay for these things, so one doesn't need to
rely on teaching or research funding to support oneself.  It's in
these more chaotic fields that it helps most to be in a great city:
you need the encouragement of feeling that people around you care
about the kind of work you do, and since you have to find peers for
yourself, you need the much larger intake mechanism of a great city.<br><br>You don't have to live in a great city your whole life to benefit
from it.  The critical years seem to be the early and middle ones
of your career.  Clearly you don't have to grow up in a great city.
Nor does it seem to matter if you go to college in one.  To most
college students a world of a few thousand people seems big enough.
Plus in college you don't yet have to face the hardest kind of
work — discovering new problems to solve.<br><br>It's when you move on to the next and much harder step that it helps
most to be in a place where you can find peers and encouragement.
You seem to be able to leave, if you want, once you've found both.
The Impressionists show the typical pattern: they were born all
over France (Pissarro was born in the Carribbean) and died all over
France, but what defined them were the years they spent together
in Paris.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Unless you're sure what you want to do and where the leading center
for it is, your best bet is probably to try living in several
places when you're young.  You can never tell what message a city
sends till you live there, or even whether it still sends one.
Often your information will be wrong: I tried living in Florence
when I was 25, thinking it would be an art center, but it turned
out I was 450 years too late.<br><br>Even when a city is still a live center of ambition, you won't know
for sure whether its message will resonate with you till you hear
it.  When I moved to New York, I was very excited at first.  It's
an exciting place.  So it took me quite a while to realize I just
wasn't like the people there.  I kept searching for the Cambridge
of New York.  It turned out it was way, way uptown: an hour uptown
by air.<br><br>Some people know at 16 what sort of work they're going to do, but
in most ambitious kids, ambition seems to precede anything specific
to be ambitious about.  They know they want to do something great.
They just haven't decided yet whether they're going to be a rock
star or a brain surgeon.  There's nothing wrong with that.  But it
means if you have this most common type of ambition, you'll probably
have to figure out where to live by trial and error.  You'll
probably have to find the city where you feel at home to know what sort of
ambition you have.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This is one of the advantages of not having the universities
in your country controlled by the government.  When governments
decide how to allocate resources, political deal-making causes
things to be spread out geographically.  No central goverment would
put its two best universities in the same town, unless it was the
capital (which would cause other problems).  But scholars seem to
like to cluster together as much as people in any other field, and
when given the freedom to they derive the same advantages from it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There are still a few old professors in Palo Alto, but one by
one they die and their houses are transformed by developers into
McMansions and sold to VPs of Bus Dev.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
How many times have you read about startup founders who continued
to live inexpensively as their companies took off?  Who continued
to dress in jeans and t-shirts, to drive the old car they had in
grad school, and so on?  If you did that in New York, people would
treat you like shit.  If you walk into a fancy restaurant in San
Francisco wearing a jeans and a t-shirt, they're nice to you; who
knows who you might be?  Not in New York.<br><br>One sign of a city's potential as a technology center is the number
of restaurants that still require jackets for men.  According to
Zagat's there are none in San Francisco, LA, Boston, or Seattle, 
4 in DC, 6 in Chicago, 8 in London, 13 in New York, and 20 in Paris.<br><br>(Zagat's lists the Ritz Carlton Dining Room in SF as requiring jackets
but I couldn't believe it, so I called to check and in fact they
don't. Apparently there's only one restaurant left on the entire West
Coast that still requires jackets: The French Laundry in Napa Valley.)<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Ideas are one step upstream from economic power, so it's
conceivable that intellectual centers like Cambridge will one day
have an edge over Silicon Valley like the one the Valley has over
New York.<br><br>This seems unlikely at the moment; if anything Boston is falling
further and further behind.  The only reason I even mention the
possibility is that the path from ideas to startups has recently
been getting smoother.  It's a lot easier now for a couple of hackers
with no business experience to start a startup than it was 10 years
ago.  If you extrapolate another 20 years, maybe the balance of
power will start to shift back.  I wouldn't bet on it, but I wouldn't
bet against it either.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
If Paris is where people care most about art, why is New York
the center of gravity of the art business?  Because in the twentieth
century, art as brand split apart from art as stuff.  New York is
where the richest buyers are, but all they demand from art is brand,
and since you can base brand on anything with a sufficiently
identifiable style, you may as well use the local stuff.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston,

 <a href="http://www.omnisio.com/startupschool08/david-heinemeier-hansson-at-startup-school-08">talk</a>
in which he suggested that startup founders
should do things the old fashioned way.  Instead of hoping to get
rich by building a valuable company and then selling stock in a
"liquidity event," founders should start companies that make money
and live off the revenues.<br><br>Sounds like a good plan.  Let's think about the optimal way to do
this.<br><br>One disadvantage of living off the revenues of your company is that
you have to keep running it.  And as anyone who runs their own
business can tell you, that requires your complete attention.  You
can't just start a business and check out once things are going
well, or they stop going well surprisingly fast.<br><br>The main economic motives of startup founders seem to be freedom
and security.  They want enough money that (a) they don't have to
worry about running out of money and (b) they can spend their time
how they want.  Running your own business offers neither.  You
certainly don't have freedom: no boss is so demanding.  Nor do you
have security, because if you stop paying attention to the company,
its revenues go away, and with them your income.<br><br>The best case, for most people, would be if you could hire someone
to manage the company for you once you'd grown it to a certain size.
Suppose you could find a really good manager.  Then you would have
both freedom and security.  You could pay as little attention to
the business as you wanted, knowing that your manager would keep
things running smoothly.  And that being so, revenues would continue
to flow in, so you'd have security as well.<br><br>There will of course be some founders who wouldn't like that idea:
the ones who like running their company so much that there's nothing
else they'd rather do.  But this group must be small.  The way you
succeed in most businesses is to be fanatically attentive
to customers' needs.  What are the odds that your own desires would
coincide exactly with the demands of this powerful, external force?<br><br>Sure, running your own company can be fairly interesting.  Viaweb
was more interesting than any job I'd had before.  And since I made
much more money from it, it offered the highest ratio of income to
boringness of anything I'd done, by orders of magnitude.  But was
it <i>the</i> most interesting work I could imagine doing?  No.<br><br>Whether the number of founders in the same position is asymptotic
or merely large, there are certainly a lot of them.  For them the
right approach would be to hand the company over to a professional
manager eventually, if they could find one who was good enough.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>So far so good.  But what if your manager was hit by a bus?  What
you really want is a management company to run your company for
you.  Then you don't depend on any one person.<br><br>If you own rental property, there are companies you can hire to
manage it for you.  Some will do everything, from finding tenants
to fixing leaks.  Of course, running companies is a lot more
complicated than managing rental property, but let's suppose there
were management companies that could do it for you. They'd charge
a lot, but wouldn't it be worth it?  I'd sacrifice a large percentage
of the income for the extra peace of mind.<br><br>I realize what I'm describing already sounds too good to be true, but I
can think of a way to make it even more attractive.  If
company management companies existed, there would be an additional
service they could offer clients: they could let them insure their
returns by pooling their risk.  After all, even a perfect manager can't save a company
when, as sometimes happens, its whole market dies, just as property
managers can't save you from the building burning down.  But a
company that managed a large enough number of companies could say
to all its clients: we'll combine the revenues from all your
companies, and pay you your proportionate share.<br><br>If such management companies existed, they'd offer the maximum of
freedom and security.  Someone would run your company for you, and
you'd be protected even if it happened to die.<br><br>Let's think about how such a management company might be organized.
The simplest way would be to have a new kind of stock representing
the total pool of companies they were managing.  When you signed
up, you'd trade your company's stock for shares of this pool, in
proportion to an estimate of your company's value that you'd both
agreed upon.  Then you'd automatically get your share of the returns
of the whole pool.<br><br>The catch is that because this kind of trade would be hard to undo,
you couldn't switch management companies.  But there's a way they
could fix that: suppose all the company management companies got
together and agreed to allow their clients to exchange shares in
all their pools.  Then you could, in effect, simultaneously choose
all the management companies to run yours for you, in whatever
proportion you wanted, and change your mind later as often as you
wanted.<br><br>If such pooled-risk company management companies existed, signing
up with one would seem the ideal plan for most people following the
route David advocated.<br><br>Good news: they do exist.  What I've just
described is an acquisition by a public company.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Unfortunately, though public acquirers are structurally identical
to pooled-risk company management companies, they don't think of
themselves that way.  With a property management company, you can
just walk in whenever you want and say "manage my rental property
for me" and they'll do it.  Whereas acquirers are, as of this
writing, extremely fickle.  Sometimes they're in a buying mood and
they'll overpay enormously; other times they're not interested.
They're like property management companies run by madmen.  Or more
precisely, by Benjamin Graham's Mr. Market.<br><br>So while on average public acquirers behave like pooled-risk company
managers, you need a window of several years to get average case
performance.  If you wait long enough (five years, say) you're
likely to hit an up cycle where some acquirer is hot to buy you.
But you can't choose when it happens.<br><br>You can't assume investors will carry you for as long as you might
have to wait. Your company has to make money.  Opinions are divided
about how early to focus on that.  
<a href="http://susanitsa.wordpress.com/2006/11/08/the-joe-kraus-qa-better-late/">Joe Kraus</a> says you should try
charging customers right away.  And yet some of the most successful
startups, including Google, ignored revenue at first and concentrated
exclusively on development.  The answer probably depends on the
type of company you're starting.  I can imagine some where trying
to make sales would be a good heuristic for product design, and
others where it would just be a distraction.  The test is probably
whether it helps you to understand your users.<br><br>You can choose whichever revenue strategy you think is best for the
type of company you're starting, so long as you're profitable.
Being profitable ensures you'll get at least the average of the
acquisition market—in which public companies do behave as pooled-risk
company management companies.<br><br>David isn't mistaken in saying you should start a company to live
off its revenues.  The mistake is thinking this is somehow opposed
to starting a company and selling it.  In fact, for most people the
latter is merely the optimal case of the former.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Michael

<p>
August 2008<br><br>Raising money is the second hardest part of starting a startup.
The hardest part is making something people want: most startups
that die, die because they didn't do that.  But the second biggest
cause of death is probably the difficulty of raising money.
Fundraising is brutal.<br><br>One reason it's so brutal is simply the brutality of markets.  People
who've spent most of their lives in schools or big companies may
not have been exposed to that.  Professors and bosses usually feel
some sense of responsibility toward you; if you make a valiant
effort and fail, they'll cut you a break.  Markets are less forgiving.
Customers don't care how hard you worked, only whether you solved
their problems.<br><br>Investors evaluate startups the way customers evaluate products,
not the way bosses evaluate employees.  If you're making a valiant
effort and failing, maybe they'll invest in your next startup, but
not this one.<br><br>But raising money from investors is harder than selling to
customers, because there are so few of them.  There's
nothing like an efficient market.  You're unlikely to have more
than 10 who are interested; it's difficult to talk to more.  So the
randomness of any one investor's behavior can really affect you.<br><br>Problem number 3: investors are very random.  All investors, including
us, are by ordinary standards incompetent.  We constantly have to
make decisions about things we don't understand, and more often
than not we're wrong.<br><br>And yet a lot is at stake.  The amounts invested by different types
of investors vary from five thousand dollars to fifty million, but
the amount usually seems large for whatever type of investor it is.
Investment decisions are big decisions.<br><br>That combination—making big decisions about things they don't
understand—tends to make investors very skittish.  VCs are notorious
for leading founders on.  Some of the more unscrupulous do it
deliberately.  But even the most well-intentioned investors can
behave in a way that would seem crazy in everyday life.  One day
they're full of enthusiasm and seem ready to write you a check on
the spot; the next they won't return your phone calls.  They're not
playing games with you.  They just can't make up their minds.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>If that weren't bad enough, these wildly fluctuating nodes are all
linked together.  Startup investors all know one another, and (though
they hate to admit it) the biggest factor in their opinion of you
is the opinion of other investors.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Talk about a recipe for
an unstable system.  You get the opposite of the damping that the
fear/greed balance usually produces in markets.  No one is interested
in a startup that's a "bargain" because everyone else hates it.<br><br>So the inefficient market you get because there are so few players
is exacerbated by the fact that they act less than independently.
The result is a system like some kind of primitive, multi-celled
sea creature, where you irritate one extremity and the whole thing
contracts violently.<br><br>Y Combinator is working to fix this.  We're trying to increase the
number of investors just as we're increasing the number of startups.
We hope that as the number of both increases we'll get something
more like an efficient market.  As t approaches infinity, Demo Day
approaches an auction.<br><br>Unfortunately, t is still very far from infinity.  What does a
startup do now, in the imperfect world we currently inhabit? The
most important thing is not to let fundraising get you down.  Startups
live or die on morale.  If you let the difficulty of raising money
destroy your morale, it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br><br>
<b>Bootstrapping (= Consulting)</b><br><br>Some would-be founders may by now be thinking, why deal with investors
at all?  If raising money is so painful, why do it?<br><br>One answer to that is obvious: because you need money to live on.
It's a fine idea in principle to finance your startup with its own
revenues, but you can't create instant customers.  Whatever you
make, you have to sell a certain amount to break even.  It will
take time to grow your sales to that point, and it's hard to predict,
till you try, how long it will take.<br><br>We could not have bootstrapped Viaweb, for example.  We charged
quite a lot for our software—about $140 per user per month—but
it was at least a year before our revenues would have covered even
our paltry costs.  We didn't have enough saved to live on for a
year.<br><br>If you factor out the "bootstrapped" companies that were actually
funded by their founders through savings or a day job, the remainder
either (a) got really lucky, which is hard to do on demand, or (b)
began life as consulting companies and gradually transformed
themselves into product companies.<br><br>Consulting is the only option you can count on.  But consulting is
far from free money.  It's not as painful as raising money from
investors, perhaps, but the pain is spread over a longer period.
Years, probably.  And for many types of startup, that delay could
be fatal.  If you're working on something so unusual that no one
else is likely to think of it, you can take your time.  Joshua
Schachter gradually built Delicious on the side while working on
Wall Street.  He got away with it because no one else realized it
was a good idea.  But if you were building something as obviously
necessary as online store software at about the same time as Viaweb,
and you were working on it on the side while spending most of your
time on client work, you were not in a good position.<br><br>Bootstrapping sounds great in principle, but this apparently verdant
territory is one from which few startups emerge alive.  The mere
fact that bootstrapped startups tend to be famous on that account
should set off alarm bells.  If it worked so well, it would be the
norm.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>
Bootstrapping may get easier, because starting a company is getting
cheaper.  But I don't think we'll ever reach the point where most
startups can do without outside funding.  Technology tends to
get dramatically cheaper, but living expenses don't.<br><br>The upshot is, you can choose your pain: either the short, sharp
pain of raising money, or the chronic ache of consulting.  For a
given total amount of pain, raising money is the better choice,
because new technology is usually more valuable now than later.<br><br>But although for most startups raising money will be the lesser
evil, it's still a pretty big evil—so big that it can easily kill
you.  Not merely in the obvious sense that if you fail to raise
money you might have to shut the company down, but because the
<i>process</i> of raising money itself can kill you.<br><br>To survive it you need a set of techniques mostly
orthogonal to the ones used in convincing investors, just as mountain
climbers need to know survival techniques that are mostly orthogonal
to those used in physically getting up and down mountains.<br><br>
<b>1. Have low expectations.</b><br><br>The reason raising money destroys so many startups' morale is not
simply that it's hard, but that it's so much harder than they
expected.  What kills you is the disappointment.  And the lower
your expectations, the harder it is to be disappointed.<br><br>Startup founders tend to be optimistic.  This can work well in
technology, at least some of the time, but it's the wrong way to
approach raising money.  Better to assume investors will always let
you down.  Acquirers too, while we're at it.  At YC one of our
secondary mantras is "Deals fall through."  No matter what deal
you have going on, assume it will fall through.  The predictive
power of this simple rule is amazing.<br><br>There will be a tendency, as a deal progresses, to start to believe
it will happen, and then to depend on it happening.  You must resist
this.  Tie yourself to the mast.  This is what kills you.  Deals
do not have a trajectory like most other human interactions, where
shared plans solidify linearly over time.  Deals often fall through
at the last moment.  Often the other party doesn't really think
about what they want till the last moment.  So you can't use your
everyday intuitions about shared plans as a guide.  When it comes
to deals, you have to consciously turn them off and become
pathologically cynical.<br><br>This is harder to do than it sounds.  It's very flattering when
eminent investors seem interested in funding you.  It's easy to
start to believe that raising money will be quick and straightforward.
But it hardly ever is.<br><br>
<b>2. Keep working on your startup.</b><br><br>It sounds obvious to say that you should keep working on your startup
while raising money.  Actually this is hard to do.  Most startups
don't manage to.<br><br>Raising money has a mysterious capacity to suck up all your attention.
Even if you only have one meeting a day with investors, somehow
that one meeting will burn up your whole day.  It costs not just
the time of the actual meeting, but the time getting there and back,
and the time preparing for it beforehand and thinking about it
afterward.<br><br>The best way to survive the distraction of meeting with investors
is probably to partition the company: to pick one founder to deal
with investors while the others keep the company going.  This works
better when a startup has 3 founders than 2, and better when the
leader of the company is not also the lead developer.  In the best
case, the company keeps moving forward at about half speed.<br><br>That's the best case, though.  More often than not the company comes
to a standstill while raising money.  And that is dangerous for so
many reasons.  Raising money always takes longer than you expect.
What seems like it's going to be a 2 week interruption turns into
a 4 month interruption.  That can be very demoralizing.  And worse
still, it can make you less attractive to investors.  They want to
invest in companies that are dynamic.  A company that hasn't done
anything new in 4 months doesn't seem dynamic, so they start to
lose interest.  Investors rarely grasp this, but much of what
they're responding to when they lose interest in a startup is the
damage done by their own indecision.<br><br>The solution: put the startup first.  Fit meetings with investors
into the spare moments in your development schedule, rather than
doing development in the spare moments between meetings with
investors.  If you keep the company moving forward—releasing new
features, increasing traffic, doing deals, getting written 
about—those investor meetings are more likely to be productive.  Not just
because your startup will seem more alive, but also because it will
be better for your own morale, which is one of the main ways investors
judge you.<br><br>
<b>3. Be conservative.</b><br><br>As conditions get worse, the optimal strategy becomes more conservative.
When things go well you can take risks; when things are bad you
want to play it safe.<br><br>I advise approaching fundraising as if it were always going badly.
The reason is that between your ability to delude yourself and the
wildly unstable nature of the system you're dealing with, things
probably either already are or could easily become much worse than
they seem.<br><br>What I tell most startups we fund is that if someone reputable
offers you funding on reasonable terms, take it.  There have been
startups that ignored this advice and got away with it—startups
that ignored a good offer in the hope of getting a better one, and
actually did.  But in the same position I'd give the same advice
again.  Who knows how many bullets were in the gun they were playing
Russian roulette with?<br><br>Corollary: if an investor seems interested, don't just let them
sit. You can't assume someone interested in investing will stay
interested.  In fact, you can't even tell (<i>they</i> can't even tell)
if they're really interested till you try to convert that interest
into money.  So if you have hot prospect, either close them now or
write them off.  And unless you already have enough funding, that
reduces to: close them now.<br><br>Startups don't win by getting great funding rounds, but by making
great products.  So finish raising money and get
back to work.<br><br>
<b>4. Be flexible.</b><br><br>There are two questions VCs ask that you shouldn't answer: "Who
else are you talking to?" and "How much are you trying to raise?"<br><br>VCs don't expect you to answer the first question. They ask it just
in case. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
They do seem to expect an answer to the second.  But
I don't think you should just tell them a number.  Not as a way to
play games with them, but because you shouldn't <i>have</i> a fixed
amount you need to raise.<br><br>The custom of a startup needing a fixed amount of funding is an
obsolete one left over from the days when startups were more
expensive.  A company that needed to build a factory or hire 50
people obviously needed to raise a certain minimum amount.  But few
technology startups are in that position today.<br><br>We advise startups to tell investors there are several different
routes they could take depending on how much they raised.  As little
as $50k could pay for food and rent for the founders for a year.
A couple hundred thousand would let them get office space and hire
some smart people they know from school.  A couple million would
let them really blow this thing out.  The message (and not just the
message, but the fact) should be: we're going to succeed no matter
what.  Raising more money just lets us do it faster.<br><br>If you're raising an angel round, the size of the round can even
change on the fly.  In fact, it's just as well to make the round
small initially, then expand as needed, rather than trying to raise
a large round and risk losing the investors you already have if you
can't raise the full amount.  You may even want to do a "rolling
close," where the round has no predetermined size, but instead you
sell stock to investors one at a time as they say yes.  That helps
break deadlocks, because you can start as soon as the first one
is ready to buy. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>5. Be independent.</b><br><br>A startup with a couple founders in their early twenties can have
expenses so low that they could be profitable on
as little as $2000 per month.  That's negligible as corporate
revenues go, but the effect on your morale and your bargaining
position is anything but.  At YC we use the phrase "ramen profitable"
to describe the situation where you're making just enough to pay
your living expenses.  Once you cross into ramen profitable,
everything changes.  You may still need investment to make it big,
but you don't need it this month.<br><br>You can't plan when you start a startup how long
it will take to become profitable.  But if you find yourself in a
position where a little more effort expended on sales would carry
you over the threshold of ramen profitable, do it.<br><br>Investors like it when you're ramen profitable.  It shows you've
thought about making money, instead of just working on amusing
technical problems; it shows you have the discipline to keep your
expenses low; but above all, it means you don't need them.<br><br>There is nothing investors like more than a startup that seems like
it's going to succeed even without them.  Investors like it when
they can help a startup, but they don't like startups that would
die without that help.<br><br>At YC we spend a lot of time trying to predict how the startups we've
funded will do, because we're trying to learn how to pick winners.
We've now watched the trajectories of so many startups that we're
getting better at predicting them.  And when we're talking
about startups we think are likely to succeed, what we find ourselves
saying is things like "Oh, those guys can take care of themselves.
They'll be fine." Not "those guys are really smart" or
"those guys are working on a great idea."
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font>
When we predict good outcomes for startups, the qualities
that come up in the supporting arguments are toughness, adaptability,
determination.  Which means to the extent we're correct, those are
the qualities you need to win.<br><br>Investors know this, at least unconsciously.   The reason they like
it when you don't need them is not simply that they like what they
can't have, but because that quality is what makes founders succeed.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhId_WG7RA">Sam Altman</a> 
has it.  You could parachute him into an island full of
cannibals and come back in 5 years and he'd be the king.  If you're
Sam Altman, you don't have to be profitable to convey to investors
that you'll succeed with or without them.  (He wasn't, and he did.)
Not everyone has Sam's deal-making ability.  I myself don't.  But
if you don't, you can let the numbers speak for you.<br><br>
<b>6. Don't take rejection personally.</b><br><br>Getting rejected by investors can make you start to doubt yourself.
After all, they're more experienced than you.  If they think your
startup is lame, aren't they probably right?<br><br>Maybe, maybe not.  The way to handle rejection is with precision.
You shouldn't simply ignore rejection.  It might mean something.
But you shouldn't automatically get demoralized either.<br><br>To understand what rejection means, you have to understand first
of all how common it is.  Statistically, the average VC is a rejection
machine.  David Hornik, a partner at August, told me:
</p><blockquote>
  The numbers for me ended up being something like 500 to 800 plans
  received and read, somewhere between 50 and 100 initial 1 hour
  meetings held, about 20 companies that I got interested in, about
  5 that I got serious about and did a bunch of work, 1 to 2 deals
  done in a year.  So the odds are against you.  You
  may be a great entrepreneur, working on interesting stuff, etc.
  but it is still incredibly unlikely that you get funded.
</blockquote>
This is less true with angels, but VCs reject practically everyone.
The structure of their business means a partner does at most 2 new
investments a year, no matter how many good startups approach him.<br><br>In addition to the odds being terrible, the average investor is,
as I mentioned, a pretty bad judge of startups.  It's harder to
judge startups than most other things, because great startup ideas
tend to seem wrong. A good startup idea has to be not just good but
novel.  And to be both good and novel, an idea probably has to seem
bad to most people, or someone would already be doing it and it
wouldn't be novel.<br><br>That makes judging startups harder than most other things one judges.
You have to be an intellectual contrarian to be a good startup
investor.  That's a problem for VCs, most of whom are not particularly
imaginative.  VCs are mostly money guys, not people who make things.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
Angels are better at appreciating novel ideas, because most
were founders themselves.<br><br>So when you get a rejection, use the data that's in it, and not what's
not.  If an investor gives you specific reasons for not investing,
look at your startup and ask if they're right.  If they're real
problems, fix them.  But don't just take their word for it.  You're
supposed to be the domain expert; you have to decide.<br><br>Though a rejection doesn't necessarily tell you anything about your
startup, it does suggest your pitch could be improved.  Figure out
what's not working and change it.  Don't just think "investors are
stupid."  Often they are, but figure out precisely where you lose
them.<br><br>Don't let rejections pile up as a depressing, undifferentiated heap.
Sort them and analyze them, and then instead of thinking "no one
likes us," you'll know precisely how big a problem you have, and
what to do about it.<br><br>
<b>7. Be able to downshift into consulting (if appropriate).</b><br><br>Consulting, as I mentioned, is a dangerous way to finance a startup.
But it's better than dying.  It's a bit like anaerobic respiration:
not the optimum solution for the long term, but it can save you
from an immediate threat.  If you're having trouble raising money
from investors at all, it could save you to be able to shift
toward consulting.<br><br>This works better for some startups than others.  It wouldn't have
been a natural fit for, say, Google, but if your company was making
software for building web sites, you could degrade fairly gracefully
into consulting by building sites for clients with it.<br><br>So long as you were careful not to get sucked permanently into
consulting, this could even have advantages.  You'd understand your
users well if you were using the software for them.  Plus as a
consulting company you might be able to get big-name users using
your software that you wouldn't have gotten as a product company.<br><br>At Viaweb we were forced to operate like a consulting company
initially, because we were so desperate for users that we'd offer
to build merchants' sites for them if they'd sign up. 
But we never charged for such work, because we didn't want them to
start treating us like actual consultants, and calling us every
time they wanted something changed on their site.  We knew we had
to stay a product company, because only
that scales.<br><br>
<b>8. Avoid inexperienced investors.</b><br><br>Though novice investors seem unthreatening they can be the most
dangerous sort, because they're so nervous.  Especially in
proportion to the amount they invest.  Raising $20,000 from a first-time
angel investor can be as much work as raising $2 million from
a VC fund.<br><br>Their lawyers are generally inexperienced too.  But while the
investors can admit they don't know what they're doing, their lawyers
can't.  One YC startup negotiated terms for a tiny round with
an angel, only to receive a 70-page agreement from his lawyer.  And
since the lawyer could never admit, in front of his client, that
he'd screwed up, he instead had to insist on retaining all the
draconian terms in it, so the deal fell through.<br><br>Of course, someone has to take money from novice investors, or there
would never be any experienced ones.  But if you do, either (a)
drive the process yourself, including supplying the 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html">paperwork</a>, or
(b) use them only to fill up a larger round led by someone else.<br><br>
<b>9. Know where you stand.</b><br><br>The most dangerous thing about investors is their indecisiveness.
The worst case scenario is the long no, the no that comes after
months of meetings.  Rejections from investors are like design
flaws: inevitable, but much less costly if you discover them early.<br><br>So while you're talking to investors, constantly look for signs of
where you stand.  How likely are they to offer you a term sheet?
What do they have to be convinced of first?  You shouldn't necessarily
always be asking these questions outright—that could get 
annoying—but you should always be collecting data about them.<br><br>Investors tend to resist committing except to the extent you push
them to.  It's in their interest to collect the maximum amount of
information while making the minimum number of decisions.  The best
way to force them to act is, of course, competing investors.  But
you can also apply some force by focusing the discussion:
by asking what specific questions they need answered to make
up their minds, and then answering them.  If you get through several
obstacles and they keep raising new ones, assume that ultimately
they're going to flake.<br><br>You have to be disciplined when collecting data about investors'
intentions.  Otherwise their desire to lead you on will combine
with your own desire to be led on to produce completely inaccurate
impressions.<br><br>Use the data to weight your strategy.
You'll probably be talking to several investors.  Focus on the ones
that are most likely to say yes.  The value of a potential investor
is a combination of how good it would be if they said yes, and how
likely they are to say it.  Put the most weight on the second factor.
Partly because the most important quality in an investor is simply
investing.  But also because, as I mentioned, the biggest factor
in investors' opinion of you is other investors' opinion of you.
If you're talking to several investors and you manage to get one
over the threshold of saying yes, it will make the others much more
interested.  So you're not sacrificing the lukewarm investors if
you focus on the hot ones; convincing the hot investors is the best
way to convince the lukewarm ones.<br><br>
<b>Future</b><br><br>I'm hopeful things won't always be so awkward. I hope that as startups
get cheaper and the number of investors increases, raising money
will become, if not easy, at least straightforward.<br><br>In the meantime, the brokenness of the funding process offers a big
opportunity.  Most investors have no idea how dangerous they are.
They'd be surprised to hear that raising money from them is something
that has to be treated as a threat to a company's survival.  They
just think they need a little more information to make up their
minds.  They don't get that there are 10 other investors who also
want a little more information, and that the process of talking to
them all can bring a startup to a standstill for months.<br><br>Because investors don't understand the cost of dealing with them,
they don't realize how much room there is for a potential competitor
to undercut them.  I know from my own experience how much faster
investors could decide, because we've brought our own time down to
20 minutes (5 minutes of reading an application plus a 10 minute
interview plus 5 minutes of discussion).  If you were investing
more money you'd want to take longer, of course.  But if we can
decide in 20 minutes, should it take anyone longer than a couple
days?<br><br>Opportunities like this don't sit unexploited forever, even in an
industry as conservative as venture capital.  So
either existing investors will start to make up their minds faster,
or new investors will emerge who do.<br><br>In the meantime founders have to treat raising money as a dangerous
process.  Fortunately, I can fix the biggest danger right here.
The biggest danger is surprise.  It's that startups will underestimate
the difficulty of raising money—that they'll cruise through all
the initial steps, but when they turn to raising money they'll find
it surprisingly hard, get demoralized, and give up. So I'm telling
you in advance: raising money is hard.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
When investors can't make up their minds, they sometimes
describe it as if it were a property of the startup.  "You're too
early for us," they sometimes say.  But which of them, if they were
taken back in a time machine to the hour Google was founded, wouldn't
offer to invest at any valuation the founders chose?  An hour old
is not too early if it's the right startup.  What "you're too early"
really means is "we can't figure out yet whether you'll succeed."<br><br>
[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Investors influence one another both directly and indirectly.
They influence one another directly through the "buzz" that surrounds
a hot startup.  But they also influence one another indirectly
<i>through the founders.</i>  When a lot of investors are interested in
you, it increases your confidence in a way that makes you much more
attractive to investors.<br><br>No VC will admit they're influenced by buzz.  Some genuinely aren't.
But there are few who can say they're not influenced by confidence.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
One VC who read this essay wrote:<br><br>"We try to avoid companies that got bootstrapped with consulting. 
It creates very bad behaviors/instincts that are hard to erase 
from a company's culture."<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
The optimal way to answer the first question is to say that
it would be improper to name names, while simultaneously implying
that you're talking to a bunch of other VCs who are all about to
give you term sheets.  If you're the sort of person who understands
how to do that, go ahead.  If not, don't even try.  Nothing annoys
VCs more than clumsy efforts to manipulate them.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
The disadvantage of expanding a round on the fly is that the
valuation is fixed at the start, so if you get a sudden rush of
interest, you may have to decide between turning some investors
away and selling more of the company than you meant to.  That's a
good problem to have, however.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
I wouldn't say that intelligence doesn't matter in startups.
We're only comparing YC startups, who've already made it over a
certain threshold.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
But not all are.  Though most VCs are suits at heart,
the most successful ones tend not to be.  Oddly enough,
the best VCs tend to be the least VC-like.<br><br>

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
October 2008<br><br>The economic situation is apparently so grim that some experts fear
we may be in for a stretch as bad as the mid seventies.<br><br>When Microsoft and Apple were founded.<br><br>As those examples suggest, a recession may not be such a bad time
to start a startup.  I'm not claiming it's a particularly good time
either.  The truth is more boring: the state of the economy doesn't
matter much either way.<br><br>If we've learned one thing from funding so many startups, it's that
they succeed or fail based on the qualities of the founders.  The
economy has some effect, certainly, but as a predictor of success
it's rounding error compared to the founders.<br><br>Which means that what matters is who you are, not when you do it.
If you're the right sort of person, you'll win even in a bad economy.
And if you're not, a good economy won't save you.  Someone who
thinks "I better not start a startup now, because the economy is
so bad" is making the same mistake as the people who thought during
the Bubble "all I have to do is start a startup, and I'll be rich."<br><br>So if you want to improve your chances, you should think far more
about who you can recruit as a cofounder than the state of the
economy.  And if you're worried about threats to the survival of
your company, don't look for them in the news.  Look in the mirror.<br><br>But for any given team of founders, would it not pay to wait till
the economy is better before taking the leap?  If you're starting
a restaurant, maybe, but not if you're working on technology.
Technology progresses more or less independently of the stock market.
So for any given idea, the payoff for acting fast in a bad economy
will be higher than for waiting.  Microsoft's first product was a
Basic interpreter for the Altair.  That was exactly what the world
needed in 1975, but if Gates and Allen had decided to wait a few
years, it would have been too late.<br><br>Of course, the idea you have now won't be the last you have.  There
are always new ideas.  But if you have a specific idea you want to
act on, act now.<br><br>That doesn't mean you can ignore the economy.  Both customers and investors
will be feeling pinched.  It's not necessarily a problem if customers
feel pinched: you may even be able to benefit from it, by making
things that <a href="http://bountii.com">save money</a>.  
Startups often make things cheaper, so in
that respect they're better positioned to prosper in a recession
than big companies.<br><br>Investors are more of a problem.  Startups generally need to raise
some amount of external funding, and investors tend to be less
willing to invest in bad times.  They shouldn't be.  Everyone knows
you're supposed to buy when times are bad and sell when times are
good.  But of course what makes investing so counterintuitive is
that in equity markets, good times are defined as everyone thinking
it's time to buy.  You have to be a contrarian to be correct, and
by definition only a minority of investors can be.<br><br>So just as investors in 1999 were tripping over one another trying
to buy into lousy startups, investors in 2009 will presumably be
reluctant to invest even in good ones.<br><br>You'll have to adapt to this.  But that's nothing new: startups
always have to adapt to the whims of investors.  Ask any founder
in any economy if they'd describe investors as fickle, and watch
the face they make.  Last year you had to be prepared to explain
how your startup was viral.  Next year you'll have to explain how
it's recession-proof.<br><br>(Those are both good things to be.  The mistake investors make is
not the criteria they use but that they always tend to focus on one
to the exclusion of the rest.)<br><br>Fortunately the way to make a startup recession-proof is to do
exactly what you should do anyway: run it as cheaply as possible.
For years I've been telling founders that the surest route to success
is to be the cockroaches of the corporate world.  The immediate
cause of death in a startup is always running out of money. So the
cheaper your company is to operate, the harder it is to kill.
And fortunately it has gotten very cheap to run a startup. A recession
will if anything make it cheaper still.<br><br>If nuclear winter really is here, it may be safer to be a cockroach
even than to keep your job.  Customers may drop off individually
if they can no longer afford you, but you're not going to lose them
all at once; markets don't "reduce headcount."<br><br>What if you quit your job to start a startup that fails, and you
can't find another?  That could be a problem if you work in sales or
marketing.  In those fields it can take months to find a new
job in a bad economy.  But hackers seem to be more liquid.  Good
hackers can always get some kind of job.  It might not be your dream
job, but you're not going to starve.<br><br>Another advantage of bad times is that there's less competition.
Technology trains leave the station at regular intervals.  If 
everyone else is cowering in a corner, you may have a whole car to
yourself.<br><br>You're an investor too.  As a founder, you're buying stock with
work: the reason Larry and Sergey are so rich is not so much that
they've done work worth tens of billions of dollars, but that they
were the first investors in Google.  And like any investor you
should buy when times are bad.<br><br>Were you nodding in agreement, thinking "stupid investors" a few
paragraphs ago when I was talking about how investors are reluctant
to put money into startups in bad markets, even though that's the
time they should rationally be most willing to buy?  Well, founders
aren't much better.  When times get bad, hackers go to grad school.
And no doubt that will happen this time too.  In fact, what makes
the preceding paragraph true is that most readers won't believe
it—at least to the extent of acting on it.<br><br>So maybe a recession is a good time to start a startup.  It's hard
to say whether advantages like lack of competition outweigh
disadvantages like reluctant investors.  But it doesn't matter much
either way.   It's the people that matter.  And for a given set of
people working on a given technology, the time to act is always
now.<br><br></font></p></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://spring.jumpidea.com/2008/10/paul-graham-badeconomy.html">Russian Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://medium.com/@Yangsupertramp/%E4%B8%BA%E5%95%A5%E8%A6%81%E5%9C%A8%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E4%B8%8D%E5%A5%BD%E7%9A%84%E6%97%B6%E5%80%99%E5%8E%BB%E5%88%9B%E4%B8%9A-c1412ca1d558">Chinese Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://twitter.com/jackzhang904/status/1238388462887137285">Japanese Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

big companies tend to have developed procedures to protect themselves
against mistakes.  A startup walks like a toddler, bashing
into things and falling over all the time.  A big company is more
deliberate.<br><br>The gradual accumulation of checks in an organization is a kind of
learning, based on disasters that have happened to it or others
like it.  After giving a contract to a supplier who goes bankrupt
and fails to deliver, for example, a company might require all
suppliers to prove they're solvent before submitting bids.<br><br>As companies grow they invariably get more such checks, either in
response to disasters they've suffered, or (probably more often)
by hiring people from bigger companies who bring with them customs
for protecting against new types of disasters.<br><br>It's natural for organizations to learn from mistakes.  The problem
is, people who propose new checks almost never consider that the
check itself has a cost.<br><br><i>Every check has a cost.</i> For example, consider the case of making
suppliers verify their solvency.  Surely that's mere prudence?  But
in fact it could have substantial costs.  There's obviously the
direct cost in time of the people on both sides who supply and check
proofs of the supplier's solvency.  But the real costs are the ones
you never hear about: the company that would be the best supplier,
but doesn't bid because they can't spare the effort to get verified.
Or the company that would be the best supplier, but falls just short
of the threshold for solvency—which will of course have been set
on the high side, since there is no apparent cost of increasing it.<br><br>Whenever someone in an organization proposes to add a new check,
they should have to explain not just the benefit but the cost.  No
matter how bad a job they did of analyzing it, this meta-check would
at least remind everyone there had to <i>be</i> a cost, and send them
looking for it.<br><br>If companies started doing that, they'd find some surprises.  Joel
Spolsky recently spoke at Y Combinator about selling software to
corporate customers.  He said that in most companies software costing
up to about $1000 could be bought by individual managers without
any additional approvals.  Above that threshold, software purchases
generally had to be approved by a committee.  But babysitting this
process was so expensive for software vendors that it didn't make
sense to charge less than $50,000.  Which means if you're making
something you might otherwise have charged $5000 for, you have to
sell it for $50,000 instead.<br><br>The purpose of the committee is presumably to ensure that the company
doesn't waste money. And yet the result is that the company pays
10 times as much.<br><br>Checks on purchases will always be expensive, because the harder
it is to sell something to you, the more it has to cost.  And not
merely linearly, either.  If you're hard enough to sell to, the
people who are best at making things don't want to bother.  The
only people who will sell to you are companies that specialize in
selling to you.  Then you've sunk to a whole new level of inefficiency.
Market mechanisms no longer protect you, because the good suppliers
are no longer in the market.<br><br>Such things happen constantly to the biggest organizations of all,
governments.  But checks instituted by governments can cause much
worse problems than merely overpaying.  Checks instituted by
governments can cripple a country's whole economy.  Up till about
1400, China was richer and more technologically advanced than Europe.
One reason Europe pulled ahead was that the Chinese government
restricted long trading voyages.  So it was left to the Europeans
to explore and eventually to dominate the rest of the world, including
China.<br><br>In more recent times, Sarbanes-Oxley has practically destroyed the
US IPO market.  That wasn't the intention of the legislators who
wrote it.  They just wanted to add a few more checks on public
companies.  But they forgot to consider the cost.  They forgot that
companies about to go public are usually rather stretched, and that
the weight of a few extra checks that might be easy for General
Electric to bear are enough to prevent younger companies from being
public at all.<br><br>Once you start to think about the cost of checks, you can start to
ask other interesting questions. Is the cost increasing or decreasing?
Is it higher in some areas than others?  Where does it increase
discontinuously?  If large organizations started to ask questions
like that, they'd learn some frightening things.<br><br>I think the cost of checks may actually be increasing.  The reason
is that software plays an increasingly important role in companies,
and the people who write software are particularly harmed by checks.<br><br>Programmers are unlike many types of workers in that the best ones
actually prefer to work hard.  This doesn't seem to be the case in
most types of work.  When I worked in fast food, we didn't prefer
the busy times.  And when I used to mow lawns, I definitely didn't
prefer it when the grass was long after a week of rain.<br><br>Programmers, though, like it better when they write more code.  Or
more precisely, when they release more code.  Programmers like to
make a difference.  Good ones, anyway.<br><br>For good programmers, one of the best things about working for a
startup is that there are few checks on releases.  In true startups,
there are no external checks at all.  If you have an idea for a new
feature in the morning, you can write it and push it to the production
servers before lunch.  And when you can do that, you have more
ideas.<br><br>At big companies, software has to go through various approvals
before it can be launched.  And the cost of doing this can be
enormous—in fact, discontinuous.  I was talking recently to a
group of three programmers whose startup had been acquired a few
years before by a big company.  When they'd been independent, they
could release changes instantly.  Now, they said, the absolute
fastest they could get code released on the production servers was
two weeks.<br><br>This didn't merely make them less productive.  It made them hate
working for the acquirer.<br><br>Here's a sign of how much programmers like to be able to work hard:
these guys would have <i>paid</i> to be able to release code immediately,
the way they used to.  I asked them if they'd trade 10% of the
acquisition price for the ability to release code immediately, and
all three instantly said yes.  Then I asked what was the maximum
percentage of the acquisition price they'd trade for it.  They said
they didn't want to think about it, because they didn't want to
know how high they'd go, but I got the impression it might be as
much as half.<br><br>They'd have sacrificed hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps
millions, just to be able to deliver more software to users.  And
you know what?  It would have been perfectly safe to let them.  In
fact, the acquirer would have been better off; not only wouldn't
these guys have broken anything, they'd have gotten a lot more done.
So the acquirer is in fact getting worse performance at greater
cost.  Just like the committee approving software purchases.<br><br>And just as the greatest danger of being hard to sell to is not
that you overpay but that the best suppliers won't even sell to
you, the greatest danger of applying too many checks to your
programmers is not that you'll make them unproductive, but that
good programmers won't even want to work for you.<br><br>Steve Jobs's famous maxim "artists ship" works both ways.  Artists
aren't merely capable of shipping.  They insist on it.  So if you
don't let people ship, you won't have any artists.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

to its ability to assemble large and disciplined organizations.
Those who bet on economies of scale generally won, which meant the
largest organizations were the most successful ones.<br><br>Things have already changed so much that this is hard for us to
believe, but till just a few decades ago the largest organizations
tended to be the most progressive.  An ambitious kid graduating
from college in 1960 wanted to work in the huge, gleaming offices
of Ford, or General Electric, or NASA.  Small meant small-time.
Small in 1960 didn't mean a cool little startup.  It meant uncle
Sid's shoe store.<br><br>When I grew up in the 1970s, the idea of the "corporate ladder" was
still very much alive.  The standard plan was to try to get into a
good college, from which one would be drafted into some organization
and then rise to positions of gradually increasing responsibility.
The more ambitious merely hoped to climb the same ladder faster.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>But in the late twentieth century something changed.  It turned out
that economies of scale were not the only force at work.  Particularly
in technology, the increase in speed one could get from smaller
groups started to trump the advantages of size.<br><br>The future turned out to be different from the one we were expecting
in 1970.  The domed cities and flying cars we expected have failed
to materialize.  But fortunately so have the jumpsuits with badges
indicating our specialty and rank.  Instead of being dominated by
a few, giant tree-structured organizations, it's now looking like
the economy of the future will be a fluid network of smaller,
independent units.<br><br>It's not so much that large organizations stopped working.  There's
no evidence that famously successful organizations like the Roman
army or the British East India Company were any less afflicted by
protocol and politics than organizations of the same size today.
But they were competing against opponents who couldn't change the
rules on the fly by discovering new technology.  Now it turns out
the rule "large and disciplined organizations win" needs to have a
qualification appended: "at games that change slowly." No one knew
till change reached a sufficient speed.<br><br>Large organizations <i>will</i> start to do worse now, though,
because for the first time in history they're no longer getting the
best people.  An ambitious kid graduating from college now doesn't
want to work for a big company.  They want to work for the hot
startup that's rapidly growing into one.  If they're really ambitious,
they want to start it. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>This doesn't mean big companies will disappear.  To say that
startups will succeed implies that big companies will exist, because
startups that succeed either become big companies or are acquired
by them. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
But large organizations will probably never again
play the leading role they did up till the last quarter of the
twentieth century.<br><br>It's kind of surprising that a trend that lasted so long would ever
run out.  How often does it happen that a rule works for thousands
of years, then switches polarity?<br><br>The millennia-long run of bigger-is-better left us with a lot of
<a href="credentials.html">traditions</a> that are now obsolete, 
but extremely deeply rooted.
Which means the ambitious can now do arbitrage on them.  It will
be very valuable to understand precisely which ideas to keep and
which can now be discarded.<br><br>The place to look is where the spread of smallness began: in the
world of startups.<br><br>There have always been occasional cases, particularly in the US,
of ambitious people who grew the ladder under them instead of
climbing it.  But till recently this was an anomalous route that
tended to be followed only by outsiders.  It was no coincidence
that the great industrialists of the nineteenth century had so
little formal education.  As huge as their companies eventually
became, they were all essentially mechanics and shopkeepers at
first.  That was a social step no one with a college education would
take if they could avoid it.  Till the rise of technology startups,
and in particular, Internet startups, it was very unusual for
educated people to start their own businesses.<br><br>The eight men who left Shockley Semiconductor to found Fairchild
Semiconductor, the original Silicon Valley startup, weren't even
trying to start a company at first.  They were just looking for a
company willing to hire them as a group.  Then one of their parents
introduced them to a small investment bank that offered to find
funding for them to start their own, so they did.  But starting a
company was an alien idea to them; it was something they backed
into.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Now I would guess that practically every Stanford or Berkeley
undergrad who knows how to program has at least considered the idea
of starting a startup.  East Coast universities are not far behind,
and British universities only a little behind them.  This pattern
suggests that attitudes at Stanford and Berkeley are not an anomaly,
but a leading indicator.  This is the way the world is going.<br><br>Of course, Internet startups are still only a fraction of the world's
economy.  Could a trend based on them be that powerful?<br><br>I think so.  There's no reason to suppose there's any limit to the
amount of work that could be done in this area.  Like science,
wealth seems to expand fractally.  Steam power was a sliver of the
British economy when Watt started working on it.  But his work led
to more work till that sliver had expanded into something bigger
than the whole economy of which it had initially been a part.<br><br>The same thing could happen with the Internet.  If Internet startups
offer the best opportunity for ambitious people, then a lot of
ambitious people will start them, and this bit of the economy will
balloon in the usual fractal way.<br><br>Even if Internet-related applications only become a tenth of the
world's economy, this component will set the tone for the rest.
The most dynamic part of the economy always does, in everything
from salaries to standards of dress.  Not just because of its
prestige, but because the principles underlying the most dynamic
part of the economy tend to be ones that work.<br><br>For the future, the trend to bet on seems to be networks of small,
autonomous groups whose performance is measured individually.  And
the societies that win will be the ones with the least impedance.<br><br>As with the original industrial revolution, some societies are going
to be better at this than others.  Within a generation of its birth
in England, the Industrial Revolution had spread to continental
Europe and North America.  But it didn't spread everywhere.  This
new way of doing things could only take root in places that were
prepared for it.  It could only spread to places that already had
a vigorous middle class.<br><br>There is a similar social component to the transformation that began
in Silicon Valley in the 1960s.  Two new kinds of techniques were
developed there: techniques for building integrated circuits, and
techniques for building a new type of company designed to grow fast
by creating new technology.  The techniques for building integrated
circuits spread rapidly to other countries.  But the techniques for
building startups didn't.  Fifty years later, startups are ubiquitous
in Silicon Valley and common in a handful of other US cities, but
they're still an anomaly in most of the world.<br><br>Part of the reason—possibly the main reason—that startups
have not spread as broadly as the Industrial Revolution did is their
social disruptiveness.  Though it brought many social changes, the
Industrial Revolution was not fighting the principle that bigger
is better.  Quite the opposite: the two dovetailed beautifully.
The new industrial companies adapted the customs of existing large
organizations like the military and the civil service, and the
resulting hybrid worked well.  "Captains of industry" issued orders
to "armies of workers," and everyone knew what they were supposed
to do.<br><br>Startups seem to go more against the grain, socially.  It's hard
for them to flourish in societies that value hierarchy and stability,
just as it was hard for industrialization to flourish in societies
ruled by people who stole at will from the merchant class.  But
there were already a handful of countries past that stage when the
Industrial Revolution happened.   There do not seem to be that many
ready this time.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

One of the bizarre consequences of this model was that the usual
way to make more money was to become a manager.  This is one of the
things startups fix.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There are a lot of reasons American car companies have been
doing so much worse than Japanese car companies, but at least one
of them is a cause for optimism: American graduates have more
options.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
It's possible that companies will one day be able to grow big
in revenues without growing big in people, but we are not very far
along that trend yet.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]

a report about entrepreneurship.  Unfortunately after reading it
they decided  it was too controversial to include.)</i><br><br>
VC funding will probably dry up somewhat during the present recession,
like it usually does in bad times.  But this time the result may
be different.  This time the number of new startups may not decrease.
And that could be dangerous for VCs.<br><br>When VC funding dried up after the Internet Bubble, startups dried
up too.   There were not a lot of new startups being founded in
2003.  But startups aren't tied to VC the way they were 10 years
ago.  It's now possible for VCs and startups to diverge.  And if
they do, they may not reconverge once the economy gets better.<br><br>The reason startups no longer depend so much on VCs is one that
everyone in the startup business knows by now: it has gotten much
cheaper to start a startup.  There are four main reasons: Moore's
law has made hardware cheap; open source has made software free;
the web has made marketing and distribution free; and more powerful
programming languages mean development teams can be smaller.  These
changes have pushed the cost of starting a startup down into the
noise.  In a lot of startups—probaby most startups funded by
Y Combinator—the biggest expense is simply the founders'
living expenses.  We've had startups that were profitable on revenues
of $3000 a month.<br><br>$3000 is insignificant as revenues go.  Why should anyone care about
a startup making $3000 a month?  Because, although insignificant
as <i>revenue</i>, this amount of money can change a startup's
<i>funding</i> situation completely.<br><br>Someone running a startup is always calculating in the back of their
mind how much "runway" they have—how long they have till the
money in the bank runs out and they either have to be profitable,
raise more money, or go out of business.  Once you cross the threshold
of profitability, however low, your runway becomes infinite.  It's
a qualitative change, like the stars turning into lines and
disappearing when the Enterprise accelerates to warp speed.  Once
you're profitable you don't need investors' money.  And because
Internet startups have become so cheap to run, the threshold of
profitability can be trivially low.  Which means many Internet
startups don't need VC-scale investments anymore.  For many startups,
VC funding has, in the language of VCs, gone from a must-have to a
nice-to-have.<br><br>This change happened while no one was looking, and its effects have
been largely masked so far.  It was during the trough after the
Internet Bubble that it became trivially cheap to start a startup,
but few realized it because startups were so out of fashion.   When
startups came back into fashion, around 2005, investors were starting
to write checks again.  And while founders may not have needed VC
money the way they used to, they were willing to take it if
offered—partly because there was a tradition of startups
taking VC money, and partly because startups, like dogs, tend to
eat when given the opportunity.  As long as VCs were writing checks,
founders were never forced to explore the limits of how little they
needed them.  There were a few startups who hit these limits
accidentally because of their unusual circumstances—most
famously 37signals, which hit the limit because they crossed into
startup land from the other direction: they started as a consulting
firm, so they had revenue before they had a product.<br><br>VCs and founders are like two components that used to be bolted
together.  Around 2000 the bolt was removed.  Because the components
have so far been subjected to the same forces, they still seem to
be joined together, but really one is just resting on the other.
A sharp impact would make them fly apart.  And the present recession
could be that impact.<br><br>Because of Y Combinator's position at the extreme end of the spectrum,
we'd be the first to see signs of a separation between founders and
investors, and we are in fact seeing it.  For example, though the
stock market crash does seem to have made investors more cautious,
it doesn't seem to have had any effect on the number of people who
want to start startups.  We take applications for funding every 6
months.  Applications for the current funding cycle closed on October
17, well after the markets tanked, and even so we got a record
number, up 40% from the same cycle a year before.<br><br>Maybe things will be different a year from now, if the economy
continues to get worse, but so far there is zero slackening of
interest among potential founders.  That's different from the way
things felt in 2001.  Then there was a widespread feeling among
potential founders that startups were over, and that one should
just go to grad school.   That isn't happening this time, and part
of the reason is that even in a bad economy it's not that hard to
build something that makes $3000 a month.  If investors stop writing
checks, who cares?<br><br>We also see signs of a divergence between founders and investors
in the attitudes of existing startups we've funded.  I was talking
to one recently that had a round fall through at the last minute
over the sort of trifle that breaks deals when investors feel they
have the upper hand—over an uncertainty about whether the
founders had correctly filed their 83(b) forms, if you can believe
that.  And yet this startup is obviously going to succeed: their
traffic and revenue graphs look like a jet taking off.  So I asked
them if they wanted me to introduce them to more investors.  To my
surprise, they said no—that they'd just spent four months
dealing with investors, and they were actually a lot happier now
that they didn't have to.  There was a friend they wanted to hire
with the investor money, and now they'd have to postpone that.  But
otherwise they felt they had enough in the bank to make it to
profitability.  To make sure, they were moving to a cheaper apartment.
And in this economy I bet they got a good deal on it.<br><br>I've detected this "investors aren't worth the trouble" vibe from
several YC founders I've talked to recently.  At least one startup
from the most recent (summer) cycle may not even raise angel money,
let alone VC.  <a href="http://ticketstumbler.com">Ticketstumbler</a>
made it to profitability on Y Combinator's $15,000 investment and
they hope not to need more.  This surprised even us.  Although YC
is based on the idea of it being cheap to start a startup, we never
anticipated that founders would grow successful startups on nothing
more than YC funding.<br><br>If founders decide VCs aren't worth the trouble, that could be bad
for VCs.  When the economy bounces back in a few years and they're
ready to write checks again, they may find that founders have moved
on.<br><br>There is a founder community just as there's a VC community.  They
all know one another, and techniques spread rapidly between them.
If one tries a new programming language or a new hosting provider
and gets good results, 6 months later half of them are using it.
And the same is true for funding.  The current generation of founders
want to raise money from VCs, and Sequoia specifically, because
Larry and Sergey took money from VCs, and Sequoia specifically.
Imagine what it would do to the VC business if the next hot company
didn't take VC at all.<br><br>VCs think they're playing a zero sum game.  In fact, it's not even
that.  If you lose a deal to Benchmark, you lose that deal, but VC
as an industry still wins.  If you lose a deal to None, all VCs
lose.<br><br>This recession may be different from the one after the Internet
Bubble.  This time founders may keep starting startups.  And if
they do, VCs will have to keep writing checks, or they could become

Korean cram schools that said <blockquote>
  Admission to the right university can make or break an ambitious
  young South Korean.
</blockquote> A parent added: <blockquote>
  "In our country, college entrance exams determine 70 to 80 percent
  of a person's future."
</blockquote> It was striking how old fashioned this sounded.  And
yet when I was in high school it wouldn't have seemed too far off
as a description of the US.  Which means things must have been
changing here.<br><br>The course of people's lives in the US now seems to be determined
less by credentials and more by performance than it was 25 years
ago.  Where you go to college still matters, but not like it used
to.<br><br>What happened?<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Judging people by their academic credentials was in its time an
advance.  The practice seems to have begun in China, where starting
in 587 candidates for the imperial civil service had to take an
exam on classical literature.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font> It was also a test of wealth,
because the knowledge it tested was so specialized that passing
required years of expensive training.  But though wealth was a
necessary condition for passing, it was not a sufficient one.  By
the standards of the rest of the world in 587, the Chinese system
was very enlightened.  Europeans didn't introduce formal civil
service exams till the nineteenth century, and even then they seem
to have been influenced by the Chinese example.<br><br>Before credentials, government positions were obtained mainly by
family influence, if not outright bribery.   It was a great step
forward to judge people by their performance on a test.  But by no
means a perfect solution.  When you judge people that way, you tend
to get cram schools—which they did in Ming China and nineteenth
century England just as much as in present day South Korea.<br><br>What cram schools are, in effect, is leaks in a seal.  The use of
credentials
was an attempt to seal off the direct transmission of power between
generations, and cram schools represent that power finding holes
in the seal.  Cram schools turn wealth in one generation into
credentials in the next.<br><br>It's hard to beat this phenomenon, because the schools adjust to suit
whatever the tests measure.  When the tests are narrow and
predictable, you get cram schools on the classic model, like those
that prepared candidates for Sandhurst (the British West Point) or
the classes American students take now to improve their SAT scores.
But as the tests get broader, the schools do too.  Preparing a
candidate for the Chinese imperial civil service exams took years,
as prep school does today.  But the raison d'etre of all these
institutions has been the same: to beat the system.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>History suggests that, all other things being equal, a society
prospers in proportion to its ability to prevent parents from
influencing their children's success directly.  It's a fine thing
for parents to help their children indirectly—for example,
by helping them to become smarter or more disciplined, which then
makes them more successful.  The problem comes when parents use
direct methods: when they are able to use their own wealth or power
as a substitute for their children's qualities.<br><br>Parents will tend to do this when they can.  Parents will die for
their kids, so it's not surprising to find they'll also push their
scruples to the limits for them.  Especially if other parents are
doing it.<br><br>Sealing off this force has a double advantage.  Not only does a
society get "the best man for the job," but
parents' ambitions are diverted from direct methods to indirect
ones—to actually trying to raise their kids well.<br><br>But we should expect it to be very hard to contain parents' efforts
to obtain an unfair advantage for their kids.  We're dealing with
one of the most powerful forces in human nature.  We shouldn't expect
naive solutions to work, any more than we'd expect naive solutions
for keeping heroin out of a prison to work.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>The obvious way to solve the problem is to make credentials better.
If the tests a society uses are currently hackable, we can study
the way people beat them and try to plug the holes.  You can use
the cram schools to show you where most of the holes are.  They
also tell you when you're succeeding in fixing them: when cram
schools become less popular.<br><br>A more general solution
would be to push for increased transparency, especially at critical
social bottlenecks like college admissions.  In the US this process
still shows many outward signs of corruption.  For example, legacy
admissions.  The official story is that legacy status doesn't carry
much weight, because all it does is break ties: applicants are
bucketed by ability, and legacy status is only used to decide between
the applicants in the bucket that straddles the cutoff.  But what
this means is that a university can make legacy status have as much
or as little weight as they want, by adjusting the size of the
bucket that straddles the cutoff.<br><br>By gradually chipping away at the abuse of credentials, you could
probably make them more airtight.  But what a long fight it would
be.  Especially when the institutions administering the tests don't
really want them to be airtight.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Fortunately there's a better way to prevent the direct transmission
of power between generations.  Instead of trying to make credentials
harder to hack, we can also make them matter less.<br><br>Let's think about what credentials are for.  What they are,
functionally, is a way of predicting performance.  If you could
measure actual performance, you wouldn't need them.<br><br>So why did they even evolve?  Why haven't we just been measuring
actual performance?  Think about where credentialism first appeared:
in selecting candidates for large organizations.  Individual
performance is hard to measure in large organizations, and the
harder performance is to measure, the more important it is
to predict it.  If an organization could immediately and cheaply
measure the performance of recruits, they wouldn't need to examine
their credentials.  They could take everyone and keep just the good
ones.<br><br>Large organizations can't do this.  But a bunch of small organizations
in a market can come close.  A market takes every organization and
keeps just the good ones.  As organizations get smaller, this
approaches taking every person and keeping just the good ones.  So
all other things being equal, a society consisting of more, smaller
organizations will care less about credentials.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>That's what's been happening in the US.  That's why those quotes
from Korea sound so old fashioned.  They're talking about an economy
like America's a few decades ago, dominated by a few big companies.
The route for the ambitious in that sort of environment is to join
one and climb to the top.  Credentials matter a lot then.  In the 
culture of a large organization, an elite pedigree becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy.<br><br>This doesn't work in small companies.  Even if your colleagues were
impressed by your credentials, they'd soon be parted from you if
your performance didn't match, because the company would go out of
business and the people would be dispersed.<br><br>In a world of small companies, performance is all anyone cares
about.  People hiring for a startup don't care whether you've even
graduated from college, let alone which one.  All they care about
is what you can do.  Which is in fact all that should matter, even
in a large organization.  The reason credentials have such prestige
is that for so long the large organizations
in a society tended to be the most powerful.  But in the US at least
they don't have the monopoly on power they once did, precisely
because they can't measure (and thus reward) individual performance.
Why spend twenty years climbing the corporate ladder when you can
get rewarded directly by the market?<br><br>I realize I see a more exaggerated version of the change than most
other people.  As a partner at an early stage venture funding firm,
I'm like a jumpmaster shoving people out of the old world of
credentials and into the new one of performance.  I'm an agent of
the change I'm seeing.  But I don't think I'm imagining it.  It was
not so easy 25 years ago for an ambitious person to choose to be
judged directly by the market.  You had to go through bosses, and
they were influenced by where you'd been to college.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>What made it possible for small organizations to succeed in America?
I'm still not entirely sure.  Startups are certainly a large part
of it.  Small organizations can develop new ideas faster than large
ones, and new ideas are increasingly valuable.<br><br>But I don't think startups account for all the shift from credentials
to measurement.  My friend Julian Weber told me that when he went
to work for a New York law firm in the 1950s they paid associates
far less than firms do today.  Law firms then made no pretense of
paying people according to the value of the work they'd done.  Pay
was based on seniority.  The younger employees were paying their
dues.  They'd be rewarded later.<br><br>The same principle prevailed at industrial companies.  When my
father was working at Westinghouse in the 1970s, he had people
working for him who made more than he did, because they'd been there
longer.<br><br>Now companies increasingly have to pay employees market price for
the work they do.   One reason is that employees no longer trust
companies to deliver 
<a href="ladder.html">deferred rewards</a>: why work to accumulate
deferred rewards at a company that might go bankrupt, or be taken
over and have all its implicit obligations wiped out?  The other
is that some companies broke ranks and started to pay young employees
large amounts.  This was particularly true in consulting, law, and
finance, where it led to the phenomenon of yuppies.  The word is
rarely used today because it's no longer surprising to see a 25
year old with money, but in 1985 the sight of a 25 year old
<i>professional</i> able to afford a new BMW was so novel that it
called forth a new word.<br><br>The classic yuppie worked for a small organization.  He didn't work
for General Widget, but for the law firm that handled General
Widget's acquisitions or the investment bank that floated their
bond issues.<br><br>Startups and yuppies entered the American conceptual vocabulary
roughly simultaneously in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  I don't
think there was a causal connection.  Startups happened because
technology started to change so fast that big companies could no
longer keep a lid on the smaller ones.  I don't think the rise of
yuppies was inspired by it; it seems more as if there was a change
in the social conventions (and perhaps the laws) governing the way
big companies worked.  But the two phenomena rapidly fused to produce
a principle that now seems obvious: paying energetic young people
market rates, and getting correspondingly high performance from
them.<br><br>At about the same time the US economy rocketed out of the doldrums
that had afflicted it for most of the 1970s.  Was there a connection?
I don't know enough to say, but it felt like it at the time.  There
was a lot of energy released.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Countries worried about their competitiveness are right to be
concerned about the number of startups started within them.  But
they would do even better to examine the underlying principle.  Do
they let energetic young people get paid market rate for the work
they do?  The young are the test, because when people aren't rewarded
according to performance, they're invariably rewarded according to
seniority instead.<br><br>All it takes is a few beachheads in your economy that pay for
performance.  Measurement spreads like heat.  If one part of a
society is better at measurement than others, it tends to push the
others to do better.  If people who are young but smart and driven
can make more by starting their own companies than by working for
existing ones, the existing companies are forced to pay more to
keep them.  So market rates gradually permeate every organization,
even the government.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The measurement of performance will tend to push even the organizations
issuing credentials into line.  When we were kids I used to annoy
my sister by ordering her to do things I knew she was about to do
anyway.  As credentials are superseded by performance, a similar
role is the best former gatekeepers can hope for.  Once credential
granting institutions are no longer in the self-fullfilling prophecy
business, they'll have to work harder to predict the future.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Credentials are a step beyond bribery and influence.  But they're
not the final step.  There's an even better way to block the
transmission of power between generations: to encourage the trend
toward an economy made of more, smaller units.  Then you can measure
what credentials merely predict.<br><br>No one likes the transmission of power between generations—not
the left or the right.  But the market forces favored by the right
turn out to be a better way of preventing it than the credentials
the left are forced to fall back on.<br><br>The era of credentials began to end when the power of large
organizations <a href="highres.html">peaked</a> 
in the late twentieth century.  Now we seem
to be entering a new era based on measurement.  The reason the new
model has advanced so rapidly is that it works so much better.  It
shows no sign of slowing.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] Miyazaki, Ichisada

uniquely useless discussions.<br><br>As a rule, any mention of religion on an online forum degenerates
into a religious argument.  Why?  Why does this happen with religion
and not with Javascript or baking or other topics people talk about
on forums?<br><br>What's different about religion is that people don't feel they need
to have any particular expertise to have opinions about
it.  All they need is strongly held beliefs, and anyone can have
those.  No thread about Javascript will grow as fast as one about
religion, because people feel they have to be over some threshold
of expertise to post comments about that.  But on religion everyone's
an expert.<br><br>Then it struck me: this is the problem with politics too.  Politics,
like religion, is a topic where there's no threshold of expertise
for expressing an opinion.  All you need is strong convictions.<br><br>Do religion and politics have something in common that explains
this similarity?  One possible explanation is that they deal with
questions that have no definite answers, so there's no back pressure
on people's opinions.  Since no one can be proven wrong, every
opinion is equally valid, and sensing this, everyone lets fly with
theirs.<br><br>But this isn't true.  There are certainly some political questions
that have definite answers, like how much a new government policy
will cost.  But the more precise political questions suffer the
same fate as the vaguer ones.<br><br>I think what religion and politics have in common is that they
become part of people's identity, and people can never have a
fruitful argument about something that's part of their identity.
By definition they're partisan.<br><br>Which topics engage people's identity depends on the people, not
the topic.  For example, a discussion about a battle that included
citizens of one or more of the countries involved would probably
degenerate into a political argument.  But a discussion today about
a battle that took place in the Bronze Age probably wouldn't.  No
one would know what side to be on.  So it's not politics that's the
source of the trouble, but identity.  When people say a discussion
has degenerated into a religious war, what they really mean is that
it has started to be driven mostly by people's identities.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Because the point at which this happens depends on the people rather
than the topic, it's a mistake to conclude that because a question
tends to provoke religious wars, it must have no answer. For example,
the question of the relative merits of programming languages often
degenerates into a religious war, because so many programmers
identify as X programmers or Y programmers.  This sometimes leads
people to conclude the question must be unanswerable—that all
languages are equally good.  Obviously that's false: anything else
people make can be well or badly designed; why should this be
uniquely impossible for programming languages?  And indeed, you can
have a fruitful discussion about the relative merits of programming
languages, so long as you exclude people who respond from identity.<br><br>More generally, you can have a fruitful discussion about a topic
only if it doesn't engage the identities of any of the
participants.  What makes politics and religion such minefields is
that they engage so many people's identities.  But you could in
principle have a useful conversation about them with some people.
And there are other topics that might seem harmless, like the
relative merits of Ford and Chevy pickup trucks, that you couldn't
safely talk about with <a href="http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060418/NEWS/604180378/1039">others</a>.<br><br>The most intriguing thing about this theory, if it's right, is that
it explains not merely which kinds of discussions to avoid, but how
to have better ideas.  If people can't think clearly about anything
that has become part of their identity, then all other things being
equal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as
possible. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Most people reading this will already be fairly tolerant.  But there
is a step beyond thinking of yourself as x but tolerating y: not
even to consider yourself an x.  The more labels you have for
yourself, the dumber they make you.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
When that happens, it tends to happen fast, like a core going
critical.  The threshold for participating goes down to zero, which
brings in more people.  And they tend to say incendiary things,
which draw more and angrier counterarguments.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There may be some things it's a net win to include in your
identity.  For example, being a scientist.  But arguably that is
more of a placeholder than an actual label—like putting NMI on a
form that asks for your middle initial—because it doesn't commit
you to believing anything in particular.   A scientist isn't committed
to believing in natural selection in the same way a biblical
literalist is committed to rejecting it.  All he's committed to is
following the evidence wherever it leads.<br><br>Considering yourself a scientist is equivalent to putting a sign
in a cupboard saying "this cupboard must be kept empty."  Yes,
strictly speaking, you're putting something in the cupboard, but
not in the ordinary sense.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, and Robert

<p>
February 2009<br><br>One of the things I always tell startups is a principle I learned
from Paul Buchheit: it's better to make a few people really happy
than to make a lot of people semi-happy.  I was saying recently to
a reporter that if I could only tell startups 10 things, this would
be one of them.  Then I thought: what would the other 9 be?<br><br>When I made the list there turned out to be 13:
</p><p style="margin-top:32px">
<b>1. Pick good cofounders.</b><br><br>Cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate.  You
can change anything about a house except where it is.  In a startup
you can change your idea easily, but changing your cofounders is
hard. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
And the success of a startup is almost always a function
of its founders.<br><br><b>2. Launch fast.</b><br><br>The reason to launch fast is not so much that it's critical to get
your product to market early, but that you haven't really started
working on it till you've launched.  Launching teaches you what you
should have been building.  Till you know that you're wasting your
time.  So the main value of whatever you launch with is as a pretext
for engaging users.<br><br><b>3. Let your idea evolve.</b><br><br>This is the second half of launching fast. Launch fast and iterate.
It's a big mistake to treat a startup as if it were merely a matter
of implementing some brilliant initial idea. As in an essay, most
of the ideas appear in the implementing.<br><br><b>4. Understand your users.</b><br><br>You can envision the wealth created by a startup as a rectangle,
where one side is the number of users and the other is how much you
improve their lives.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
The second dimension is the one you have
most control over.  And indeed, the growth in the first will be
driven by how well you do in the second.  As in science, the hard
part is not answering questions but asking them: the hard part is
seeing something new that users lack. The better you understand
them the better the odds of doing that. That's why so many successful
startups make something the founders needed.<br><br><b>5. Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent.</b><br><br>Ideally you want to make large numbers of users love you, but you
can't expect to hit that right away.  Initially you have to choose
between satisfying all the needs of a subset of potential users,
or satisfying a subset of the needs of all potential users.  Take
the first. It's easier to expand userwise than satisfactionwise.
And perhaps more importantly, it's harder to lie to yourself.  If
you think you're 85% of the way to a great product, how do you know
it's not 70%?  Or 10%?  Whereas it's easy to know how many users
you have.<br><br><b>6. Offer surprisingly good customer service.</b><br><br>Customers are used to being maltreated.  Most of the companies they
deal with are quasi-monopolies that get away with atrocious customer
service. Your own ideas about what's possible have been unconsciously
lowered by such experiences.  Try making your customer service not
merely good, but 
<a href="http://www.diaryofawebsite.com/blog/2008/07/wufoo-and-the-art-of-customer-service/">surprisingly good</a>.  Go out of your way to make
people happy.  They'll be overwhelmed; you'll see.  In the earliest
stages of a startup, it pays to offer customer service on a level
that wouldn't scale, because it's a way of learning about your
users.<br><br><b>7. You make what you measure.</b><br><br>I learned this one from Joe Kraus. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Merely measuring something
has an uncanny tendency to improve it.  If you want to make your
user numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and every
day plot the number of users.  You'll be delighted when it goes up
and disappointed when it goes down.  Pretty soon you'll start
noticing what makes the number go up, and you'll start to do more
of that.  Corollary: be careful what you measure.<br><br><b>8. Spend little.</b><br><br>I can't emphasize enough how important it is for a startup to be cheap.
Most startups fail before they make something people want, and the
most common form of failure is running out of money.  So being cheap
is (almost) interchangeable with iterating rapidly.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
But it's
more than that.  A culture of cheapness keeps companies young in
something like the way exercise keeps people young.<br><br><b>9. Get ramen profitable.</b><br><br>"Ramen profitable" means a startup makes just enough to pay the
founders' living expenses.  It's not rapid prototyping for business
models (though it can be), but more a way of hacking the investment
process.  Once you cross over into ramen profitable, it completely
changes your relationship with investors.  It's also great for
morale.<br><br><b>10. Avoid distractions.</b><br><br>Nothing kills startups like distractions.  The worst type are those
that pay money: day jobs, consulting, profitable side-projects.
The startup may have more long-term potential, but you'll always
interrupt working on it to answer calls from people paying you now.
Paradoxically, <a href="fundraising.html">fundraising</a> is this type of distraction, so try to
minimize that too.<br><br><b>11. Don't get demoralized.</b><br><br>Though the immediate cause of death in a startup tends to be running
out of money, the underlying cause is usually lack of focus.  Either
the company is run by stupid people (which can't be fixed with
advice) or the people are smart but got demoralized.  Starting a
startup is a huge moral weight.  Understand this and make a conscious
effort not to be ground down by it, just as you'd be careful to
bend at the knees when picking up a heavy box.<br><br><b>12. Don't give up.</b><br><br>Even if you get demoralized, <a href="die.html">don't give up</a>.  You can get surprisingly
far by just not giving up.  This isn't true in all fields.  There
are a lot of people who couldn't become good mathematicians no
matter how long they persisted.  But startups aren't like that.
Sheer effort is usually enough, so long as you keep morphing your
idea.<br><br><b>13. Deals fall through.</b><br><br>One of the most useful skills we learned from Viaweb was not getting
our hopes up.  We probably had 20 deals of various types fall
through.  After the first 10 or so we learned to treat deals as
background processes that we should ignore till they terminated.
It's very dangerous to morale to start to depend on deals closing,
not just because they so often don't, but because it makes them
less likely to.
</p></font><p style="margin-top:32px"><font size="2" face="verdana">
Having gotten it down to 13 sentences, I asked myself which I'd
choose if I could only keep one.<br><br>Understand your users.  That's the key.  The essential task in a
startup is to create wealth; the dimension of wealth you have most
control over is how much you improve users' lives; and the hardest
part of that is knowing what to make for them.  Once you know what
to make, it's mere effort to make it, and most decent hackers are
capable of that.<br><br>Understanding your users is part of half the principles in this
list.  That's the reason to launch early, to understand your users.
Evolving your idea is the embodiment of understanding your users.
Understanding your users well will tend to push you toward making
something that makes a few people deeply happy.  The most important
reason for having surprisingly good customer service is that it
helps you understand your users.  And understanding your users will
even ensure your morale, because when everything else is collapsing
around you, having just ten users who love you will keep you going.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Strictly speaking it's impossible without a time machine.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In practice it's more like a ragged comb.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Joe thinks one of the founders of Hewlett Packard said it first,
but he doesn't remember which.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
They'd be interchangeable if markets stood still.  Since they
don't, working twice as fast is better than having twice as much
time.<br><br></font></p></div><br><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-reddits-2.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://blog.tayfunsen.com/2009/05/13-cumlede-startuplar.html">Turkish Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-reddits-2.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.recursosparapymes.com/las-13-cosas-que-paul-graham-le-diria-a-un-emprendedor/">Spanish Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-reddits-2.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.entrepreneur.bg/7301/dobriyat-startap-v-13-izrecheniya/">Bulgarian Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-reddits-2.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://note.com/tokyojack/n/nb5598e41a3c0">Japanese Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-reddits-2.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://virgool.io/@mahdikhashan/%D9%BE%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84-%DA%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%BE-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%B2%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%84%D9%87-gduckqxgkoe6">Persian Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div>

old last week.  Initially it was supposed to be a side project—an
application to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and future
Y Combinator founders to exchange news.  It's grown bigger and taken
up more time than I expected, but I don't regret that because I've
learned so much from working on it.<br><br><b>Growth</b><br><br>When we launched in February 2007, weekday traffic was around 1600
daily uniques.  It's since <a href="http://ycombinator.com/images/2yeartraffic.png">grown</a> to around 22,000.  This growth
rate is a bit higher than I'd like.  I'd like the site to grow,
since a site that isn't growing at least slowly is probably dead.
But I wouldn't want it to grow as large as Digg or Reddit—mainly
because that would dilute the character of the site, but also because
I don't want to spend all my time dealing with scaling.<br><br>I already have problems enough with that.  Remember, the original
motivation for HN was to test a new programming language, and
moreover one that's focused on experimenting with language design,
not performance.  Every time the site gets slow, I fortify myself
by recalling McIlroy and Bentley's famous quote
<blockquote>
  The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special
  cases.
</blockquote>
and look for the bottleneck I can remove with least code.  So far
I've been able to keep up, in the sense that performance has remained
consistently mediocre despite 14x growth. I don't know what I'll
do next, but I'll probably think of something.<br><br>This is my attitude to the site generally.  Hacker News is an
experiment, and an experiment in a very young field.  Sites of this
type are only a few years old.  Internet conversation generally is
only a few decades old.  So we've probably only discovered a fraction
of what we eventually will.<br><br>That's why I'm so optimistic about HN.  When a technology is this
young, the existing solutions are usually terrible; which means it
must be possible to do much better; which means many problems that
seem insoluble aren't. Including, I hope, the problem that has
afflicted so many previous communities: being ruined by growth.<br><br><b>Dilution</b><br><br>Users have worried about that since the site was a few months old.
So far these alarms have been false, but they may not always be.
Dilution is a hard problem. But probably soluble; it doesn't mean
much that open conversations have "always" been destroyed by growth
when "always" equals 20 instances.<br><br>But it's important to remember we're trying to solve a new problem,
because that means we're going to have to try new things, most of
which probably won't work.  A couple weeks ago I tried displaying
the names of users with the highest average comment scores in orange.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
That was a mistake.  Suddenly a culture that had been more
or less united was divided into haves and have-nots.  I didn't
realize how united the culture had been till I saw it divided.  It
was painful to watch.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>So orange usernames won't be back.  (Sorry about that.)  But there
will be other equally broken-seeming ideas in the future, and the
ones that turn out to work will probably seem just as broken as
those that don't.<br><br>Probably the most important thing I've learned about dilution is
that it's measured more in behavior than users. It's bad behavior
you want to keep out more than bad people. User behavior turns out
to be surprisingly malleable.  If people are 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html">expected</a> to behave
well, they tend to; and vice versa.<br><br>Though of course forbidding bad behavior does tend to keep away bad
people, because they feel uncomfortably constrained in a place where
they have to behave well.  But this way of keeping them out is
gentler and probably also more effective than overt barriers.<br><br>It's pretty clear now that the broken windows theory applies to
community sites as well.  The theory is that minor forms of bad
behavior encourage worse ones: that a neighborhood with lots of
graffiti and broken windows becomes one where robberies occur.  I
was living in New York when Giuliani introduced the reforms that
made the broken windows theory famous, and the transformation was
miraculous. And I was a Reddit user when the opposite happened
there, and the transformation was equally dramatic.<br><br>I'm not criticizing Steve and Alexis.  What happened to Reddit
didn't happen out of neglect.  From the start they had a policy of
censoring nothing except spam.  Plus Reddit had different goals
from Hacker News.  Reddit was a startup, not a side project; its
goal was to grow as fast as possible.  Combine rapid growth and
zero censorship, and the result is a free for all.  But I don't
think they'd do much differently if they were doing it again.
Measured by traffic, Reddit is much more successful than Hacker
News.<br><br>But what happened to Reddit won't inevitably happen to HN. There
are several local maxima.  There can be places that are free for
alls and places that are more thoughtful, just as there are in the
real world; and people will behave differently depending on which
they're in, just as they do in the real world.<br><br>I've observed this in the wild.  I've seen people cross-posting on
Reddit and Hacker News who actually took the trouble to write two
versions, a flame for Reddit and a more subdued version for HN.<br><br><b>Submissions</b><br><br>There are two major types of problems a site like Hacker News needs
to avoid: bad stories and bad comments.  So far the danger of bad
stories seems smaller.  The stories on the frontpage now are still
roughly the ones that would have been there when HN started.<br><br>I once thought I'd have to weight votes to keep crap off the
frontpage, but I haven't had to yet.  I wouldn't have predicted the
frontpage would hold up so well, and I'm not sure why it has.
Perhaps only the more thoughtful users care enough to submit and
upvote links, so the marginal cost of one random new user approaches
zero.  Or perhaps the frontpage protects itself, by advertising what type of submission is expected.<br><br>The most dangerous thing for the frontpage is stuff that's too easy
to upvote.  If someone proves a new theorem, it takes some work by
the reader to decide whether or not to upvote it.  An amusing cartoon
takes less.  A rant with a rallying cry as the title takes zero,
because people vote it up without even reading it.<br><br>Hence what I call the Fluff Principle: on a user-voted news site,
the links that are easiest to judge will take over unless you take
specific measures to prevent it.<br><br>Hacker News has two kinds of protections against fluff.  The most
common types of fluff links are banned as off-topic.  Pictures of
kittens, political diatribes, and so on are explicitly banned.  This
keeps out most fluff, but not all of it.  Some links are both fluff,
in the sense of being very short, and also on topic.<br><br>There's no single solution to that.  If a link is just an empty
rant, editors will sometimes kill it even if it's on topic in the
sense of being about hacking, because it's not on topic by the real
standard, which is to engage one's intellectual curiosity.  If the
posts on a site are characteristically of this type I sometimes ban
it, which means new stuff at that url is auto-killed.  If a post
has a linkbait title, editors sometimes rephrase it to be more
matter-of-fact.  This is especially necessary with links whose
titles are rallying cries, because otherwise they become implicit
"vote up if you believe such-and-such" posts, which are the most
extreme form of fluff.<br><br>The techniques for dealing with links have to evolve, because the
links do. The existence of aggregators has already affected what
they aggregate. Writers now deliberately write things to draw traffic
from aggregators—sometimes even specific ones.  (No, the irony
of this statement is not lost on me.)  Then there are the more
sinister mutations, like linkjacking—posting a paraphrase of
someone else's article and submitting that instead of the original.
These can get a lot of upvotes, because a lot of what's good in an
article often survives; indeed, the closer the paraphrase is to
plagiarism, the more survives.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>I think it's important that a site that kills submissions provide
a way for users to see what got killed if they want to.  That keeps
editors honest, and just as importantly, makes users confident
they'd know if the editors stopped being honest. HN users can do
this by flipping a switch called showdead in their profile.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Comments</b><br><br>Bad comments seem to be a harder problem than bad submissions.
While the quality of links on the frontpage of HN hasn't changed
much, the quality of the median comment may have decreased somewhat.<br><br>There are two main kinds of badness in comments: meanness and
stupidity.  There is a lot of overlap between the two—mean
comments are disproportionately likely also to be dumb—but
the strategies for dealing with them are different.  Meanness is
easier to control.  You can have rules saying one shouldn't be mean,
and if you enforce them it seems possible to keep a lid on meanness.<br><br>Keeping a lid on stupidity is harder, perhaps because stupidity is
not so easily distinguishable.  Mean people are more likely to know
they're being mean than stupid people are to know they're being
stupid.<br><br>The most dangerous form of stupid comment is not the long but
mistaken argument, but the dumb joke.  Long but mistaken arguments
are actually quite rare.  There is a strong correlation between
comment quality and length; if you wanted to compare the quality
of comments on community sites, average length would be a good
predictor.  Probably the cause is human nature rather than anything
specific to comment threads. Probably it's simply that stupidity
more often takes the form of having few ideas than wrong ones.<br><br>Whatever the cause, stupid comments tend to be short.  And since
it's hard to write a short comment that's distinguished for the
amount of information it conveys, people try to distinguish them
instead by being funny.  The most tempting format for stupid comments
is the supposedly witty put-down, probably because put-downs are
the easiest form of humor. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
So one advantage of forbidding
meanness is that it also cuts down on these.<br><br>Bad comments are like kudzu: they take over rapidly. Comments have
much more effect on new comments than submissions have on new
submissions.  If someone submits a lame article, the other submissions
don't all become lame.  But if someone posts a stupid comment on a
thread, that sets the tone for the region around it.  People reply
to dumb jokes with dumb jokes.<br><br>Maybe the solution is to add a delay before people can respond to
a comment, and make the length of the delay inversely proportional
to some prediction of its quality.  Then dumb threads would grow
slower.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>People</b><br><br>I notice most of the techniques I've described are conservative:
they're aimed at preserving the character of the site rather than
enhancing it.  I don't think that's a bias of mine.  It's due to
the shape of the problem.  Hacker News had the good fortune to start
out good, so in this case it's literally a matter of preservation.
But I think this principle would also apply to sites with different
origins.<br><br>The good things in a community site come from people more than
technology; it's mainly in the prevention of bad things that
technology comes into play. Technology certainly can enhance
discussion.  Nested comments do, for example.  But I'd rather use
a site with primitive features and smart, nice users than a more
advanced one whose users were idiots or <a href="trolls.html">trolls</a>.<br><br>So the most important thing a community site can do is attract the
kind of people it wants.  A site trying to be as big as possible
wants to attract everyone.  But a site aiming at a particular subset
of users has to attract just those—and just as importantly,
repel everyone else.  I've made a conscious effort to do this on
HN.  The graphic design is as plain as possible, and the site rules
discourage dramatic link titles.  The goal is that the only thing
to interest someone arriving at HN for the first time should be the
ideas expressed there.<br><br>The downside of tuning a site to attract certain people is that,
to those people, it can be too attractive.  I'm all too aware how
addictive Hacker News can be.  For me, as for many users, it's a
kind of virtual town square.  When I want to take a break from
working, I walk into the square, just as I might into Harvard Square
or University Ave in the physical world.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
But an online square is
more dangerous than a physical one.  If I spent half the day loitering
on University Ave, I'd notice.  I have to walk a mile to get there,
and sitting in a cafe feels different from working. But visiting
an online forum takes just a click, and feels superficially very
much like working.  You may be wasting your time, but you're not
idle.  Someone is <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">wrong</a> on the Internet, and you're fixing the
problem.<br><br>Hacker News is definitely useful.  I've learned a lot from things
I've read on HN.  I've written several essays that began as comments
there.  So I wouldn't want the site to go away.  But I would like
to be sure it's not a net drag on productivity.  What a disaster
that would be, to attract thousands of smart people to a site that
caused them to waste lots of time.  I wish I could be 100% sure
that's not a description of HN.<br><br>I feel like the addictiveness of games and social applications is
still a mostly unsolved problem.  The situation now is like it was
with crack in the 1980s: we've invented terribly addictive new
things, and we haven't yet evolved ways to protect ourselves from
them.  We will eventually, and that's one of the problems I hope
to focus on next.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I tried ranking users by both average and median comment
score, and average (with the high score thrown out) seemed the more
accurate predictor of high quality.  Median may be the more accurate
predictor of low quality though.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Another thing I learned from this experiment is that if you're
going to distinguish between people, you better be sure you do it
right.  This is one problem where rapid prototyping doesn't work.<br><br>Indeed, that's the intellectually honest argument for not discriminating
between various types of people.  The reason not to do it is not
that everyone's the same, but that it's bad to do wrong and hard
to do right.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
When I catch egregiously linkjacked posts I replace the url
with that of whatever they copied.  Sites that habitually linkjack
get banned.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Digg is notorious for its lack of transparency.  The root of
the problem is not that the guys running Digg are especially sneaky,
but that they use the wrong algorithm for generating their frontpage.
Instead of bubbling up from the bottom as they get more votes, as
on Reddit, stories start at the top and get pushed down by new
arrivals.<br><br>The reason for the difference is that Digg is derived from Slashdot,
while Reddit is derived from Delicious/popular.  Digg is Slashdot
with voting instead of editors, and Reddit is Delicious/popular
with voting instead of bookmarking.  (You can still see fossils of
their origins in their graphic design.)<br><br>Digg's algorithm is very vulnerable to gaming, because any story
that makes it onto the frontpage is the new top story.  Which in
turn forces Digg to respond with extreme countermeasures.  A lot
of startups have some kind of secret about the subterfuges they had
to resort to in the early days, and I suspect Digg's is the extent
to which the top stories were de facto chosen by human editors.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
The dialog on Beavis and Butthead was composed largely of
these, and when I read comments on really bad sites I can hear them
in their voices.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
I suspect most of the techniques for discouraging stupid
comments have yet to be discovered.  Xkcd implemented a particularly
clever one in its IRC channel: don't allow the same thing twice.
Once someone has said "fail," no one can ever say it again.  This
would penalize short comments especially, because they have less
room to avoid collisions in.<br><br>Another promising idea is the <a href="http://stupidfilter.org">stupid 
filter</a>, which is just like a
probabilistic spam filter, but trained on corpora of stupid and
non-stupid comments instead.<br><br>You may not have to kill bad comments to solve the problem.  Comments
at the bottom of a long thread are rarely seen, so it may be enough
to incorporate a prediction of quality in the comment sorting
algorithm.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
What makes most suburbs so demoralizing is that there's no
center to walk to.<br><br>

Maybe.</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">February 2009<br><br>A lot of cities look at Silicon Valley and ask "How could we make
something like that happen here?"  The 
<a href="siliconvalley.html">organic</a> way to do it is to
establish a first-rate university in a place where rich people want
to live. That's how Silicon Valley happened.  But could you shortcut
the process by funding startups?<br><br>Possibly. Let's consider what it would take.<br><br>The first thing to understand is that encouraging startups is a
different problem from encouraging startups in a particular city.
The latter is much more expensive.<br><br>People sometimes think they could improve the startup scene in their
town by starting something like <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y 
Combinator</a> there, but in fact it
will have near zero effect.  I know because Y Combinator itself had
near zero effect on Boston when we were based there half the year.
The people we funded came from all over the country (indeed, the
world) and afterward they went wherever they could get more
funding—which generally meant Silicon Valley.<br><br>The seed funding business is not a regional business, because at
that stage startups are mobile. They're just a couple founders with
laptops. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you want to encourage startups in a particular city, you have
to fund startups that won't leave.  There are two ways to do that:
have rules preventing them from leaving, or fund them at the point
in their life when they naturally take root.  The first approach
is a mistake, because it becomes a filter for selecting bad startups.
If your terms force startups to do things they don't want to, only
the desperate ones will take your money.<br><br>Good startups will move to another city as a condition of funding.
What they won't do is agree not to move the next time they need
funding.  So the only way to get them to stay is to give them enough
that they never need to leave.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>How much would that take?  If you want to keep startups from leaving
your town, you have to give them enough that they're not tempted
by an offer from Silicon Valley VCs that requires them to move.  A
startup would be able to refuse such an offer if they had grown to
the point where they were (a) rooted in your town and/or (b) so
successful that VCs would fund them even if they didn't move.<br><br>How much would it cost to grow a startup to that point? A minimum
of several hundred thousand dollars.  <a href="http://wufoo.com">Wufoo</a> 
seem to have rooted
themselves in Tampa on $118k, but they're an extreme case.  On
average it would take at least half a million.<br><br>So if it seems too good to be true to think you could grow a local
silicon valley by giving startups $15-20k each like Y Combinator,
that's because it is.  To make them stick around you'd have to give
them at least 20 times that much.<br><br>However, even that is an interesting prospect.  Suppose to be on
the safe side it would cost a million dollars per startup. If you
could get startups to stick to your town for a million apiece, then
for a billion dollars you could bring in a thousand startups. That probably wouldn't push you past Silicon Valley itself, 
but it might get you second place.<br><br>For the price of a football stadium, any town that was decent to
live in could make itself one of the biggest startup hubs in the
world.<br><br>What's more, it wouldn't take very long.   You could probably do
it in five years.  During the term of one mayor. And it would get
easier over time, because the more startups you had in town, the
less it would take to get new ones to move there. By the time you
had a thousand startups in town, the VCs wouldn't be trying so hard
to get them to move to Silicon Valley; instead they'd be opening
local offices.  Then you'd really be in good shape.  You'd have
started a self-sustaining chain reaction like the one that drives
the Valley.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>But now comes the hard part.  You have to pick the startups.  How
do you do that?  Picking startups is a rare and valuable skill, and
the handful of people who have it are not readily hireable.  And
this skill is so hard to measure that if a government did try to
hire people with it, they'd almost certainly get the wrong ones.<br><br>For example, a city could give money to a VC fund to establish a
local branch, and let them make the choices.  But only a bad VC
fund would take that deal.  They wouldn't <i>seem</i> bad to the city
officials.  They'd seem very impressive.  But they'd be bad at
picking startups.  That's the characteristic failure mode of VCs.
All VCs look impressive to limited partners.  The difference between
the good ones and the bad ones only becomes visible in the other
half of their jobs: choosing and advising startups.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>What you really want is a pool of local angel investors—people
investing money they made from their own startups.  But unfortunately
you run into a chicken and egg problem here.  If your city isn't
already a startup hub, there won't be people there who got rich
from startups. And there is no way I can think of that a city could
attract angels from outside. By definition they're rich.  There's
no incentive that would make them move.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>However, a city could select startups by piggybacking on the expertise
of investors who weren't local.  It would be pretty straightforward
to make a list of the most eminent Silicon Valley angels and from
that to generate a list of all the startups they'd invested in.  If
a city offered these companies a million dollars each to move, a
lot of the earlier stage ones would probably take it.<br><br>Preposterous as this plan sounds, it's probably the most efficient
way a city could select good startups.<br><br>It would hurt the startups somewhat to be separated from their
original investors. On the other hand, the extra million dollars
would give them a lot more runway.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>Would the transplanted startups survive?  Quite possibly. The only
way to find out would be to try it.  It would be a pretty cheap
experiment, as civil expenditures go.  Pick 30 startups that eminent
angels have recently invested in, give them each a million dollars
if they'll relocate to your city, and see what happens after a year.
If they seem to be thriving, you can try importing startups on a
larger scale.<br><br>Don't be too legalistic about the conditions under which they're
allowed to leave.  Just have a gentlemen's agreement.<br><br>Don't try to do it on the cheap and pick only 10 for the initial
experiment.  If you do this on too small a scale you'll just guarantee
failure. Startups need to be around other startups.  30 would be
enough to feel like a community.<br><br>Don't try to make them all work in some renovated warehouse you've
made into an "incubator."  Real startups prefer to work in their
own spaces.<br><br>In fact, don't impose any restrictions on the startups at all.
Startup founders are mostly <a href="gba.html">hackers</a>, 
and hackers are much more
constrained by gentlemen's agreements than regulations.  If they
shake your hand on a promise, they'll keep it.  But show them a
lock and their first thought is how to pick it.<br><br>Interestingly, the 30-startup experiment could be done by any
sufficiently rich private citizen.  And what pressure it would 
put on the city if it worked.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><center>___</center><br><br>Should the city take stock in return for the money?
In principle they're entitled to, but how would they choose valuations
for the startups?  You couldn't just give them all the same valuation:
that would be too low for some (who'd turn you down) and too high
for others (because it might make their next round a "down round").
And since we're assuming we're doing this without being able to
pick startups, we also have to assume we can't value them, since
that's practically the same thing.<br><br>Another reason not to take stock in the startups is that startups
are often involved in disreputable things.  So are established
companies, but they don't get blamed for it.  If someone gets
murdered by someone they met on Facebook, the press will treat the
story as if it were about Facebook.  If someone gets murdered by
someone they met at a supermarket, the press will just treat it as
a story about a murder.  So understand that if you invest in startups,
they might build things that get used for pornography, or file-sharing,
or the expression of unfashionable opinions.  You should probably
sponsor this project jointly with your political opponents, so they
can't use whatever the startups do as a club to beat you with.<br><br>It would be too much of a political liability just to give
the startups the money, though.  So the best plan would be to 
make it convertible debt, but which didn't convert except in
a really big round, like $20 million.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>How well this scheme worked would depend on the 
<a href="cities.html">city</a>.  There are
some towns, like Portland, that would be easy to turn into startup
hubs, and others, like Detroit, where it would really be an uphill
battle.  So be honest with yourself about the sort of town you have
before you try this.<br><br>It will be easier in proportion to how much your town resembles San
Francisco.  Do you have good weather?  Do people live downtown, or
have they abandoned the center for the suburbs?  Would the city be
described as "hip" and "tolerant," or as reflecting "traditional
values?"  Are there good universities nearby?  Are there walkable
neighborhoods?  Would nerds feel at home?  If you answered yes to
all these questions, you might be able not only to pull off this
scheme, but to do it for less than a million per startup.<br><br>I realize the chance of any city having
the political will to carry out this plan is microscopically
small.  I just wanted to explore what it would take if one did.
How hard would it be to jumpstart a silicon valley?  It's
fascinating to think this prize might be within
the reach of so many cities.  So even though they'll all still
spend the money on the stadium, at least now someone can ask them:
why did you choose to do that instead of becoming a serious
rival to Silicon Valley?<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
What people who start these supposedly local seed firms always
find is that (a) their applicants come from all over, not just the
local area, and (b) the local startups also apply to the other seed
firms.  So what ends up happening is that the applicant pool gets
partitioned by quality rather than geography.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Interestingly, the bad VCs fail by choosing startups run by
people like them—people who are good presenters, but have no
real substance.   It's a case of the fake leading the fake.  And
since everyone involved is so plausible, the LPs who invest in these
funds have no idea what's happening till they measure their returns.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Not even being a tax haven, I suspect.  That makes some rich
people move, but not the type who would make good angel investors
in startups.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]

collision course and started to speculate about what they'd produce
when they converged.  We now know the answer: computers.  It's clear
now that even by using the word "convergence" we were giving TV too
much credit.  This won't be convergence so much as replacement.
People may still watch things they call "TV shows," but they'll
watch them mostly on computers.<br><br>What decided the contest for computers?  Four forces, three of which
one could have predicted, and one that would have been harder to.<br><br>One predictable cause of victory is that the Internet is an open
platform.  Anyone can build whatever they want on it, and the market
picks the winners.  So innovation happens at hacker speeds instead
of big company speeds.<br><br>The second is Moore's Law, which has worked its usual magic on
Internet bandwidth. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The third reason computers won is piracy. Users prefer it 
not just because it's free, but because it's
more convenient.  Bittorrent and YouTube have already trained a new
generation of viewers that the place to watch shows is on a computer
screen.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The somewhat more surprising force was one specific type of innovation:
social applications.  The average teenage kid has a pretty much
infinite capacity for talking to their friends.  But they can't
physically be with them all the time.  When I was in high school
the solution was the telephone.  Now it's social networks, multiplayer
games, and various messaging applications.  The way you reach them
all is through a computer.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Which means every teenage kid (a)
wants a computer with an Internet connection, (b) has an incentive
to figure out how to use it, and (c) spends countless hours in front
of it.<br><br>This was the most powerful force of all.  This was what made everyone
want computers.  Nerds got computers because they liked them.  Then
gamers got them to play games on.  But it was connecting to other
people that got everyone else: that's what made even grandmas and
14 year old girls want computers.
<!--
Computers still aren't really ready for prime time.  I'm pretty
comfortable with technology, but I would be horrified at the prospect
of having to deal with the virus-ridden Windows machine the average
person uses.  I can't believe they put up with it.  But they will
to reach their friends.--><br><br>After decades of running an IV drip right into their audience,
people in the entertainment business had understandably come to
think of them as rather passive.  They thought they'd be able to
dictate the way shows reached audiences.  But they underestimated
the force of their desire to connect with one another.<br><br>Facebook killed TV.  That is wildly oversimplified, of course, but
probably as close to the truth as you can get in three words.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>The TV networks already seem, grudgingly, to see where things are
going, and have responded by putting their stuff, grudgingly, online.
But they're still dragging their heels.  They still seem to wish
people would watch shows on TV instead, just as newspapers that put
their stories online still seem to wish people would wait till the
next morning and read them printed on paper.  They should both just
face the fact that the Internet is the primary medium.<br><br>They'd be in a better position if they'd done that earlier.  When
a new medium arises that's powerful enough to make incumbents
nervous, then it's probably powerful enough to win, and the best
thing they can do is jump in immediately.<br><br>Whether they like it or not, big changes are coming, because the
Internet dissolves the two cornerstones of broadcast media:
synchronicity and locality.  On the Internet, you don't have to
send everyone the same signal, and you don't have to send it to
them from a local source.  People will watch what they want when
they want it, and group themselves according to whatever shared
interest they feel most strongly.  Maybe their strongest shared
interest will be their physical location, but I'm guessing not.
Which means local TV is probably dead.  It was an artifact of
limitations imposed by old technology.  If someone were creating
an Internet-based TV company from scratch now, they might have some
plan for shows aimed at specific regions, but it wouldn't be a top
priority.<br><br>Synchronicity and locality are tied together.  TV network affiliates
care what's on at 10 because that delivers viewers for local news
at 11.  This connection adds more brittleness than strength, however:
people don't watch what's on at 10 because they want to watch the
news afterward.<br><br>TV networks will fight these trends, because they don't have
sufficient flexibility to adapt to them.  They're hemmed in by local
affiliates in much the same way car companies are hemmed in by
dealers and unions.  Inevitably, the people running the networks
will take the easy route and try to keep the old model running for
a couple more years, just as the record labels have done.<br><br>A recent article in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> described how TV networks
were trying to add more live shows, partly as a way to make viewers
watch TV synchronously instead of watching recorded shows when it
suited them.  Instead of delivering what viewers want, they're
trying to force them to change their habits to suit the networks'
obsolete business model.  That never works unless you have a monopoly
or cartel to enforce it, and even then it only works temporarily.<br><br>The other reason networks like live shows is that they're cheaper
to produce.  There they have the right idea, but they haven't
followed it to its conclusion.   Live content can be way cheaper
than networks realize, and the way to take advantage of dramatic
decreases in cost is to 
<a href="http://justin.tv">increase volume</a>.  The networks are prevented
from seeing this whole line of reasoning because they still think
of themselves as being in the broadcast business—as sending one
signal to everyone.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><center>___</center><br><br><a href="badeconomy.html">Now</a> would be a good time to start any company that competes with
TV networks.  That's what a lot of Internet startups are, though
they may not have had this as an explicit goal.  People only have
so many leisure hours a day, and TV is premised on such long sessions
(unlike Google, which prides itself on sending users on their way
quickly) that anything that takes up their time is competing with
it.  But in addition to such indirect competitors, I think TV
companies will increasingly face direct ones.<br><br>Even in cable TV, the long tail was lopped off prematurely by the
threshold you had to get over to start a new channel.  It will be
longer on the Internet, and there will be more mobility within it.
In this new world, the existing players will only have the advantages
any big company has in its market.<br><br>That will change the balance of power between the networks and the
people who produce shows.  The networks used to be gatekeepers.
They distributed your work, and sold advertising on it.  Now the
people who produce a show can distribute it themselves.  The main
value networks supply now is ad sales.  Which will tend to put them
in the position of service providers rather than publishers.<br><br>Shows will change even more.  On the Internet there's no reason to
keep their current format, or even the fact that they have a single
format.  Indeed, the more interesting sort of convergence that's
coming is between shows and games.  But on the question of what
sort of entertainment gets distributed on the Internet in 20 years,
I wouldn't dare to make any predictions, except that things will
change a lot.  We'll get whatever the most imaginative people can
cook up.  That's why the Internet won.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Thanks to Trevor Blackwell for this point.  He adds: "I
remember the eyes of phone companies gleaming in the early 90s when
they talked about convergence.  They thought most programming would
be on demand, and they would implement it and make a lot of money.
It didn't work out. They assumed that their local network infrastructure
would be critical to do video on-demand, because you couldn't
possibly stream it from a few data centers over the internet. At
the time (1992) the entire cross-country Internet bandwidth wasn't
enough for one video stream. But wide-area bandwidth increased more
than they expected and they were beaten by iTunes and Hulu."<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Copyright owners tend to focus on the aspect they see of
piracy, which is the lost revenue.  They therefore think what drives
users to do it is the desire to get something for free.  But iTunes
shows that people will pay for stuff online, if you make it easy.
A significant component of piracy is simply that it offers a better
user experience.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Or a phone that is actually a computer.  I'm not making any
predictions about the size of the device that will replace TV, just
that it will have a browser and get data via the Internet.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Emmett Shear writes: "I'd argue the long tail for sports may
be even larger than the long tail for other kinds of content. Anyone
can broadcast a high school football game that will be interesting
to 10,000 people or so, even if the quality of production is not
so good."<br><br>

investing.  Seven years later I still hadn't started.  I put it off
because it seemed mysterious and complicated.   It turns out to be 
easier than I expected, and also more interesting.<br><br>The part I thought was hard, the mechanics of investing, really
isn't. You give a startup money and they give you stock.  You'll
probably get either preferred stock, which means stock with extra
rights like getting your money back first in a sale, or convertible
debt, which means (on paper) you're lending the company money, and
the debt converts to stock at the next sufficiently big funding
round. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>There are sometimes minor tactical advantages to using one or the
other.  The paperwork for convertible debt is simpler.  But really
it doesn't matter much which you use.  Don't spend much time worrying
about the details of deal terms, especially when you first start
angel investing.  That's not how you win at this game.  When you
hear people talking about a successful angel investor, they're not
saying "He got a 4x liquidation preference." They're saying "He
invested in Google."<br><br>That's how you win: by investing in the right startups.  That is
so much more important than anything else that I worry I'm misleading
you by even talking about other things.<br><br><b>Mechanics</b><br><br>Angel investors often syndicate deals, which means they join together
to invest on the same terms.  In a syndicate there is usually a
"lead" investor who negotiates the terms with the startup.  But not
always: sometimes the startup cobbles together a syndicate of
investors who approach them independently, and the startup's lawyer
supplies the paperwork.<br><br>The easiest way to get started in angel investing is to find a
friend who already does it, and try to get included in his syndicates.
Then all you have to do is write checks.<br><br>Don't feel like you have to join a syndicate, though.  It's not that
hard to do it yourself.  You can just use the standard 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html">series AA</a>
documents Wilson Sonsini and Y Combinator published online.
You should of course have your lawyer review everything.  Both you
and the startup should have lawyers.  But the lawyers don't have
to create the agreement from scratch.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>
When you negotiate terms with a startup, there are two numbers you
care about: how much money you're putting in, and the valuation of
the company.  The valuation determines how much stock you get.  If
you put $50,000 into a company at a pre-money valuation of $1
million, then the post-money valuation is $1.05 million, and you
get .05/1.05, or 4.76% of the company's stock.<br><br>If the company raises more money later, the new investor will take
a chunk of the company away from all the existing shareholders just
as you did.  If in the next round they sell 10% of the company to
a new investor, your 4.76% will be reduced to 4.28%.<br><br>That's ok.  Dilution is normal.  What saves you from being mistreated
in future rounds, usually, is that you're in the same boat as the
founders.  They can't dilute you without diluting themselves just
as much.  And they won't dilute themselves unless they end up 
<a href="equity.html">net ahead</a>.  So in theory, each further 
round of investment leaves you
with a smaller share of an even more valuable company, till after
several more rounds you end up with .5% of the company at the point
where it IPOs, and you are very happy because your $50,000 has
become $5 million. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The agreement by which you invest should have provisions that 
let you contribute to
future rounds to maintain your percentage.  So it's your choice
whether you get diluted.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
If the company does really well,
you eventually will, because eventually the valuations will get so
high it's not worth it for you.<br><br>How much does an angel invest?  That varies enormously, from $10,000
to hundreds of thousands or in rare cases even millions.  The upper
bound is obviously the total amount the founders want to raise.
The lower bound is 5-10% of the total or $10,000, whichever
is greater.  A typical angel round these days might be $150,000
raised from 5 people.<br><br>Valuations don't vary as much.  For angel rounds it's rare to see
a valuation lower than half a million or higher than 4 or 5 million.
4 million is starting to be VC territory.<br><br>How do you decide what valuation to offer?  If you're part of a
round led by someone else, that problem is solved for you.  But
what if you're investing by yourself?  There's no real answer.
There is no rational way to value an early stage startup.  The
valuation reflects nothing more than the strength of the company's
bargaining position.  If they really want you, either because they
desperately need money, or you're someone who can help them a lot,
they'll let you invest at a low valuation.  If they don't need you,
it will be higher.  So guess.  The startup may not have any more
idea what the number should be than you do. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Ultimately it doesn't matter much.  When angels make a lot of money
from a deal, it's not because they invested at a valuation of $1.5
million instead of $3 million.  It's because the company was really
successful.<br><br>I can't emphasize that too much.  Don't get hung up on mechanics
or deal terms.  What you should spend your time thinking about is
whether the company is good.<br><br>(Similarly, founders also should not get hung up on deal
terms, but should spend their time thinking about how to make the
company good.)<br><br>There's a second less obvious component of an angel investment: how
much you're expected to help the startup.  Like the amount you
invest, this can vary a lot.  You don't have to do anything if you
don't want to; you could simply be a source of money.  Or you can
become a de facto employee of the company.  Just make sure that you
and the startup agree in advance about roughly how much you'll do
for them.<br><br>Really hot companies sometimes have high standards for angels.  The
ones everyone wants to invest in practically audition investors,
and only take money from people who are famous and/or will work
hard for them.  But don't feel like you have to put in a lot of
time or you won't get to invest in any good startups.  There is a
surprising lack of correlation between how hot a deal a startup is
and how well it ends up doing.  Lots of hot startups will end up
failing, and lots of startups no one likes will end up succeeding.
And the latter are so desperate for money that they'll take it from
anyone at a low valuation. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Picking Winners</b><br><br>It would be nice to be able to pick those out, wouldn't it?  The
part of angel investing that has most effect on your returns, picking
the right companies, is also the hardest.  So you should practically
ignore (or more precisely, archive, in the Gmail sense) everything
I've told you so far.  You may need to refer to it at some point,
but it is not the central issue.<br><br>The central issue is picking the right startups.  What "Make something
people want" is for startups, "Pick the right startups" is for
investors.  Combined they yield "Pick the startups that will make
something people want."<br><br>How do you do that?  It's not as simple as picking startups that
are already making something wildly popular.  By then it's
too late for angels.  VCs will already be onto them.  As an angel,
you have to pick startups before they've got a hit—either
because they've made something great but users don't realize it
yet, like Google early on, or because they're still an iteration
or two away from the big hit, like Paypal when they were making
software for transferring money between PDAs.<br><br>To be a good angel investor, you have to be a good judge of potential.
That's what it comes down to.  VCs can be fast followers.  Most of
them don't try to predict what will win.  They just try to notice
quickly when something already is winning.  But angels have to be
able to predict.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>One interesting consequence of this fact is that there are a lot
of people out there who have never even made an angel investment
and yet are already better angel investors than they realize.
Someone who doesn't know the first thing about the mechanics of
venture funding but knows what a successful startup founder looks
like is actually far ahead of someone who knows termsheets inside
out, but thinks 
<a href="gba.html">"hacker"</a> means someone who breaks into computers.
If you can recognize good startup founders by empathizing with
them—if you both resonate at the same frequency—then
you may already be a better startup picker than the median professional
VC.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>Paul Buchheit, for example, started angel investing about a year
after me, and he was pretty much immediately as good as me at picking
startups.  My extra year of experience was rounding error compared
to our ability to empathize with founders.<br><br>What makes a good founder?  If there were a word that meant the
opposite of hapless, that would be the one.  Bad founders seem
hapless.  They may be smart, or not, but somehow events overwhelm
them and they get discouraged and give up.  Good founders make
things happen the way they want.  Which is not to say they force
things to happen in a predefined way.  Good founders have a healthy
respect for reality.  But they are relentlessly resourceful.  That's
the closest I can get to the opposite of hapless.  You want to fund
people who are relentlessly resourceful.<br><br>Notice we started out talking about things, and now we're talking
about people.  There is an ongoing debate between investors which
is more important, the people, or the idea—or more precisely,
the market. Some, like Ron Conway, say it's the people—that
the idea will change, but the people are the foundation of the
company.  Whereas Marc Andreessen says he'd back ok founders in a
hot market over great founders in a bad one.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>These two positions are not so far apart as they seem, because good
people find good markets.  Bill Gates would probably have ended up
pretty rich even if IBM hadn't happened to drop the PC standard in
his lap.<br><br>I've thought a lot about the disagreement between the investors who
prefer to bet on people and those who prefer to bet on markets.
It's kind of surprising that it even exists.  You'd expect opinions
to have converged more.<br><br>But I think I've figured out what's going on.  The three most
prominent people I know who favor markets are Marc, Jawed Karim,
and Joe Kraus.  And all three of them, in their own startups,
basically flew into a thermal: they hit a market growing so fast
that it was all they could do to keep up with it.  That kind of
experience is hard to ignore.  Plus I think they underestimate
themselves: they think back to how easy it felt to ride that huge
thermal upward, and they think "anyone could have done it."  But
that isn't true; they are not ordinary people.<br><br>So as an angel investor I think you want to go with Ron Conway and
bet on people.  Thermals happen, yes, but no one can predict
them—not even the founders, and certainly not you as an
investor.  And only good people can ride the thermals if they hit
them anyway.<br><br><b>Deal Flow</b><br><br>Of course the question of how to choose startups presumes you
have startups to choose between.  How do you find them?  This is
yet another problem that gets solved for you by syndicates.  If you
tag along on a friend's investments, you don't have to find startups.<br><br>The problem is not finding startups, exactly, but finding a stream
of reasonably high quality ones.  The traditional way to do this
is through contacts.  If you're friends with a lot of investors and
founders, they'll send deals your way.  The Valley basically runs
on referrals.  And once you start to become known as reliable,
useful investor, people will refer lots of deals to you.  I certainly
will.<br><br>There's also a newer way to find startups, which is to come to
events like Y Combinator's Demo Day, where a batch of newly created
startups presents to investors all at once.   We have two Demo Days
a year, one in March and one in August.  These are basically mass
referrals.<br><br>But events like Demo Day only account for a fraction of matches
between startups and investors.  The personal referral is still the
most common route.  So if you want to hear about new startups, the
best way to do it is to get lots of referrals.<br><br>The best way to get lots of referrals is to invest in startups.  No
matter how smart and nice you seem, insiders will be reluctant to
send you referrals until you've proven yourself by doing a couple
investments.  Some smart, nice guys turn out to be flaky,
high-maintenance investors. But once you prove yourself as a good
investor, the deal flow, as they call it, will increase rapidly in
both quality and quantity.  At the extreme, for someone like Ron
Conway, it is basically identical with the deal flow of the whole
Valley.<br><br>So if you want to invest seriously, the way to get started is to
bootstrap yourself off your existing connections, be a good investor
in the startups you meet that way, and eventually you'll start a
chain reaction.  Good investors are rare, even in Silicon Valley.
There probably aren't more than a couple hundred serious angels in the whole
Valley, and yet they're probably the single most important ingredient
in making the Valley what it is.  Angels are the limiting reagent
in startup formation.<br><br>If there are only a couple hundred serious angels in the Valley, 
then by deciding to become one you could single-handedly make the pipeline
for startups in Silicon Valley significantly wider.  That is kind
of mind-blowing.<br><br><b>Being Good</b><br><br>How do you be a good angel investor?  The first thing you need is
to be decisive.  When we talk to founders about good and bad
investors, one of the ways we describe the good ones is to say "he
writes checks." That doesn't mean the investor says yes to everyone.
Far from it.  It means he makes up his mind quickly,
and follows through.  You may be thinking, how hard could that be?
You'll see when you try it.  It follows from the nature of angel
investing that the decisions are hard.  You have to guess early,
at the stage when the most promising ideas still seem counterintuitive,
because if they were obviously good, VCs would already have funded
them.<br><br>Suppose it's 1998.  You come across a startup founded by a couple
grad students.  They say they're going to work on Internet search.
There are already a bunch of big public companies doing search.
How can these grad students possibly compete with them?  And does
search even matter anyway?  All the search engines are trying to
get people to start calling them "portals" instead.  Why would you
want to invest in a startup run by a couple of nobodies who are
trying to compete with large, aggressive companies in an area they
themselves have declared passe?  And yet the grad students seem
pretty smart.  What do you do?<br><br>There's a hack for being decisive when you're inexperienced: ratchet
down the size of your investment till it's an amount you wouldn't
care too much about losing.  For every rich person (you probably
shouldn't try angel investing unless you think of yourself as rich)
there's some amount that would be painless, though annoying, to
lose.  Till you feel comfortable investing, don't invest more than
that per startup.<br><br>For example, if you have $5 million in investable assets, it would
probably be painless (though annoying) to lose $15,000.  That's
less than .3% of your net worth.  So start by making 3 or 4 $15,000
investments.  Nothing will teach you about angel investing like
experience.  Treat the first few as an educational expense.  $60,000
is less than a lot of graduate programs.  Plus you get equity.<br><br>What's really uncool is to be strategically indecisive: to string
founders along while trying to gather more information about the
startup's trajectory. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font>
 There's always a temptation to do that,
because you just have so little to go on, but you have to consciously
resist it.  In the long term it's to your advantage to be good.<br><br>The other component of being a good angel investor is simply to be
a good person.  Angel investing is not a business where you make
money by screwing people over.  Startups create wealth, and
creating wealth is not a zero sum game.  No one has to lose for you
to win.  In fact, if you mistreat the founders you invest in, they'll
just get demoralized and the company will do worse.  Plus your
referrals will dry up.  So I recommend being good.<br><br>The most successful angel investors I know are all basically good
people.  Once they invest in a company, all they want to do is help
it.  And they'll help people they haven't invested in too.  When
they do favors they don't seem to keep track of them.  It's too
much overhead.  They just try to help everyone, and assume good
things will flow back to them somehow. Empirically that seems to
work.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Convertible debt can be either capped at a particular valuation,
or can be done at a discount to whatever the valuation turns out
to be when it converts.  E.g. convertible debt at a discount of 30%
means when it converts you get stock as if you'd invested at a 30%
lower valuation.  That can be useful in cases where you can't or
don't want to figure out what the valuation should be.  You leave
it to the next investor.  On the other hand, a lot of investors
want to know exactly what they're getting, so they will only do
convertible debt with a cap.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
The expensive part of creating an agreement from scratch is
not writing the agreement, but bickering at several hundred
dollars an hour over the details.  That's why the series AA paperwork
aims at a middle ground.  You can just start from the compromise
you'd have reached after lots of back and forth.<br><br>When you fund a startup, both your lawyers should be specialists
in startups.  Do not use ordinary corporate lawyers for this.  Their
inexperience makes them overbuild: they'll create huge, overcomplicated
agreements, and spend hours arguing over irrelevant things.<br><br>In the Valley, the top startup law firms are Wilson Sonsini, Orrick,
Fenwick &amp; West, Gunderson Dettmer, and Cooley Godward.  In Boston
the best are Goodwin Procter, Wilmer Hale, and Foley Hoag.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Your mileage may vary.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
These anti-dilution provisions also protect you against
tricks like a later investor trying to steal the company by doing
another round that values the company at $1.  If you have a competent
startup lawyer handle the deal for you, you should be protected
against such tricks initially.  But it could become a problem later.
If a big VC firm wants to invest in the startup after you, they may
try to make you take out your anti-dilution protections.  And if
they do the startup will be pressuring you to agree.  They'll tell
you that if you don't, you're going to kill their deal with the VC.
I recommend you solve this problem by having a gentlemen's agreement
with the founders: agree with them in advance that you're not going
to give up your anti-dilution protections.  Then it's up to them
to tell VCs early on.<br><br>The reason you don't want to give them up is the following scenario.
The VCs recapitalize the company, meaning they give it additional
funding at a pre-money valuation of zero.  This wipes out the
existing shareholders, including both you and the founders.  They
then grant the founders lots of options, because they need them to
stay around, but you get nothing.<br><br>Obviously this is not a nice thing to do.  It doesn't happen often.
Brand-name VCs wouldn't recapitalize a company just to steal a few
percent from an angel.  But there's a continuum here.  A less
upstanding, lower-tier VC might be tempted to do it to steal a big
chunk of stock.<br><br>I'm not saying you should always absolutely refuse to give up your
anti-dilution protections.  Everything is a negotiation.  If you're
part of a powerful syndicate, you might be able to give up legal
protections and rely on social ones.  If you invest in a deal led
by a big angel like Ron Conway, for example, you're pretty well
protected against being mistreated, because any VC would think twice
before crossing him.  This kind of protection is one of the reasons
angels like to invest in syndicates.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Don't invest so much, or at such a low valuation, that you
end up with an excessively large share of a startup, unless you're
sure your money will be the last they ever need.  Later stage
investors won't invest in a company if the founders don't have
enough equity left to motivate them.  I talked to a VC recently who
said he'd met with a company he really liked, but he turned
them down because investors already owned more than half of it.
Those investors probably thought they'd been pretty clever by getting
such a large chunk of this desirable company, but in fact they were
shooting themselves in the foot.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
At any given time I know of at least 3 or 4 YC alumni who I
believe will be big successes but who are running on vapor,
financially, because investors don't yet get what they're doing.
(And no, unfortunately, I can't tell you who they are.  I can't
refer a startup to an investor I don't know.)<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
There are some VCs who can predict instead of reacting.  Not
surprisingly, these are the most successful ones.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
It's somewhat sneaky of me to put it this way, because the
median VC loses money.  That's one of the most surprising things
I've learned about VC while working on Y Combinator.  Only a fraction
of VCs even have positive returns.  The rest exist to satisfy demand
among fund managers for venture capital as an asset class.  Learning
this explained a lot about some of the VCs I encountered when we
were working on Viaweb.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
VCs also generally say they prefer great markets to great
people.  But what they're really saying is they want both.  They're
so selective that they only even consider great people.  So when
they say they care above all about big markets, they mean that's
how they choose between great people.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
Founders rightly dislike the sort of investor who says he's
interested in investing but doesn't want to lead.  There are
circumstances where this is an acceptable excuse, but more often
than not what it means is "No, but if you turn out to be a hot deal,
I want to be able to claim retroactively I said yes."<br><br>If you like a startup enough to invest in it, then invest in it.
Just use the standard <a href="http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html">series

March 2009<br><br>A couple days ago I finally got being a good startup founder down
to two words:  relentlessly resourceful.<br><br>Till then the best I'd managed was to get the opposite quality down
to one: hapless.  Most dictionaries say hapless means unlucky.  But
the dictionaries are not doing a very good job.  A team that outplays
its opponents but loses because of a bad decision by the referee
could be called unlucky, but not hapless.  Hapless implies passivity.
To be hapless is to be battered by circumstances — to let the world
have its way with you, instead of having your way with the world.
<!--Unlucky is a bad synonym, because it emphasizes the role of chance
in bad outcomes.  Hapless overlaps more with the other component
of bad outcomes, the half that makes them deserved. -->
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Unfortunately there's no antonym of hapless, which makes it difficult
to tell founders what to aim for.  "Don't be hapless" is not much
of a rallying cry.<br><br>It's not hard to express the quality we're looking for in metaphors.
The best is probably a running back.  A good running back is not
merely determined, but flexible as well.  They want to get downfield,
but they adapt their plans on the fly.<br><br>Unfortunately this is just a metaphor, and not a useful one to most
people outside the US.   "Be like a running back" is no better than
"Don't be hapless."<br><br>But finally I've figured out how to express this quality directly.
I was writing a talk for 
<a href="angelinvesting.html">investors</a>, and I had to explain what to
look for in founders.  What would someone who was the opposite of
hapless be like?  They'd be relentlessly resourceful.  Not merely
relentless.  That's not enough to make things go your way except
in a few mostly uninteresting domains.  In any interesting domain,
the difficulties will be novel.  Which means you can't simply plow
through them, because you don't know initially how hard they are;
you don't know whether you're about to plow through a block of foam
or granite.  So you have to be resourceful. You have to keep
trying new things.<br><br>Be relentlessly resourceful.<br><br>That sounds right, but is it simply a description
of how to be successful in general?  I don't think so.  This isn't
the recipe for success in writing or painting, for example.  In
that kind of work the recipe is more to be actively curious.
Resourceful implies the obstacles are external, which they generally
are in startups. But in writing and painting they're mostly internal;
the obstacle is your own obtuseness.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>There probably are other fields where "relentlessly resourceful"
is the recipe for success.  But though other fields may share it,
I think this is the best short description we'll find of what makes
a good startup founder.  I doubt it could be made more precise.<br><br>Now that we know what we're looking for, that leads to other
questions.  For example, can this quality be taught?  After four
years of trying to teach it to people, I'd say that yes, surprisingly
often it can.  Not to everyone, but to many people. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Some
people are just constitutionally passive, but others have a latent
ability to be relentlessly resourceful that only needs to be brought
out.<br><br>This is particularly true of young people who have till now always
been under the thumb of some kind of authority.  Being relentlessly
resourceful is definitely not the recipe for success in big companies,
or in most schools.  I don't even want to think what the recipe is
in big companies, but it is certainly longer and messier, involving
some combination of resourcefulness, obedience, and building
alliances.<br><br>Identifying this quality also brings us closer to answering a
question people often wonder about: how many startups there could
be.  There is not, as some people seem to think, any economic upper
bound on this number.  There's no reason to believe there is any
limit on the amount of newly created wealth consumers can absorb,
any more than there is a limit on the number of theorems that can
be proven.  So probably the limiting factor on the number of startups
is the pool of potential founders.  Some people would make good
founders, and others wouldn't.  And now that we can say what makes
a good founder, we know how to put an upper bound on the size of
the pool.<br><br>This test is also useful to individuals.  If you want to know whether
you're the right sort of person to start a startup, ask yourself
whether you're relentlessly resourceful.  And if you want to know
whether to recruit someone as a cofounder, ask if they are.<br><br>You can even use it tactically.  If I were running a startup, this
would be the phrase I'd tape to the mirror.  "Make something people
want" is the destination, but "Be relentlessly resourceful" is how
you get there.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I think the reason the dictionaries are wrong is that the
meaning of the word has shifted.  No one writing a dictionary from
scratch today would say that hapless meant unlucky.  But a couple
hundred years ago they might have.  People were more at the mercy
of circumstances in the past, and as a result a lot of the words
we use for good and bad outcomes have origins in words about luck.<br><br>When I was living in Italy, I was once trying to tell someone
that I hadn't had much success in doing something, but I couldn't
think of the Italian word for success.  I spent some time trying
to describe the word I meant.  Finally she said "Ah! Fortuna!"<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There are aspects of startups where the recipe is to be
actively curious.  There can be times when what you're doing is
almost pure discovery.  Unfortunately these times are a small
proportion of the whole.  On the other hand, they are in research
too.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
I'd almost say to most people, but I realize (a) I have no
idea what most people are like, and (b) I'm pathologically optimistic
about people's ability to change.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts

interesting startup founders of the last 30 years.  How do
you decide who's the most interesting?  The best test seemed
to be influence: who are the 5
who've influenced me most?  Who do I use as examples when I'm
talking to companies we fund?  Who do I find myself quoting?<br><br><b>1. Steve Jobs</b><br><br>I'd guess Steve is the most influential founder not just for me but
for most people you could ask.  A lot of startup culture is Apple
culture.  He was the original young founder.  And while the concept
of "insanely great" already existed in the arts, it was a novel
idea to introduce into a company in the 1980s.<br><br>More remarkable still, he's stayed interesting for 30 years.  People
await new Apple products the way they'd await new books by a popular
novelist.  Steve may not literally design them, but they wouldn't
happen if he weren't CEO.<br><br>Steve is clever and driven, but so are a lot of people in the Valley.
What makes him unique is his 
<a href="taste.html">sense of 
design</a>.  Before him, most
companies treated design as a frivolous extra.  Apple's competitors
now know better.<br><br><b>2. TJ Rodgers</b><br><br>TJ Rodgers isn't as famous as Steve Jobs, but he may be the best
writer among Silicon Valley CEOs.  I've probably learned more from
him about the startup way of thinking than from anyone else.  Not
so much from specific things he's written as by reconstructing the
mind that produced them: brutally candid; aggressively garbage-collecting
outdated ideas; and yet driven by pragmatism rather than ideology.<br><br>The first essay of his that I read was so electrifying that I
remember exactly where I was at the time.  It was 
<a href="http://www.cypress.com/?rID=34993">High
Technology Innovation: Free Markets or Government Subsidies?</a> and
I was downstairs in the Harvard Square T Station.  It felt as if
someone had flipped on a light switch inside my head.<br><br><b>3. Larry &amp; Sergey</b><br><br>I'm sorry to treat Larry and Sergey as one person.  I've always
thought that was unfair to them.  But it does seem as if Google was a
collaboration.<br><br>Before Google, companies in Silicon Valley already knew it was
important to have the best hackers.  So they claimed, at least.
But Google pushed this idea further than anyone had before.  Their
hypothesis seems to have been that, in the initial stages at least,
<i>all</i> you need is good hackers: if you hire all the smartest people
and put them to work on a problem where their success can be measured,
you win.  All the other stuff—which includes all the stuff that
business schools think business consists of—you can figure out
along the way.  The results won't be perfect, but they'll be optimal.
If this was their hypothesis, it's now been verified experimentally.<br><br><b>4. Paul Buchheit</b><br><br>Few know this, but one person, Paul Buchheit, is responsible for
three of the best things Google has done.  He was the original
author of GMail, which is the most impressive thing Google has after
search.  He also wrote the first prototype of AdSense, and was the
author of Google's mantra "Don't be evil."<br><br>PB made a point in a talk once that I now mention to every startup
we fund: that it's better, initially, to make a small number of
users really love you than a large number kind of like you.   If I
could tell startups only 
<a href="13sentences.html">ten sentences</a>, 
this would be one of them.<br><br>Now he's cofounder of a startup called Friendfeed.  It's only a
year old, but already everyone in the Valley is watching them.
Someone responsible for three of the biggest ideas at Google is
going to come up with more.<br><br><b>5. Sam Altman</b><br><br>I was told I shouldn't mention founders of YC-funded companies in
this list.   But Sam Altman can't be stopped by such flimsy rules.
If he wants to be on this list, he's going to be.<br><br>Honestly, Sam is, along with Steve Jobs, the founder I refer to
most when I'm advising startups.  On questions of design, I ask
"What would Steve do?" but on questions of strategy or ambition I
ask "What would Sama do?"<br><br>What I learned from meeting Sama is that the doctrine of the elect
applies to startups.  It applies way less than most people think:
startup investing does not consist of trying to pick winners the
way you might in a horse race.  But there are a few people with
such force of will that they're going to get whatever they want.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

April 2009<br><br>I usually avoid politics, but since we now seem to have an administration that's open to suggestions, I'm going to risk making one.  The single biggest thing the government could do to increase the number of startups in this country is a policy that would cost nothing: establish a new class of visa for <nota 11="" 15="" 2006="" href="href=" http:="" venturebeat.com="" note-to-washington-about-half-of-vc-backed-company-founders-are-immigrants="" "="">startup founders.<br><br>The biggest constraint on the number of new startups that get created in the US is not tax policy or employment law or even Sarbanes-Oxley.  It's that we won't let the people who want to start them into the country.<br><br>Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy.  If we assume 4 people per startup, which is probably an overestimate, that's 2500 new companies.  <i>Each year.</i>  They wouldn't all grow as big as Google, but out of 2500 some would come close.<br><br>By definition these 10,000 founders wouldn't be taking jobs from Americans: it could be part of the terms of the visa that they couldn't work for existing companies, only new ones they'd founded.  In fact they'd cause there to be 
more jobs for Americans, because the companies they started would hire more employees as they grew.<br><br>The tricky part might seem to be how one defined a startup. But that could be solved quite easily: let the market decide.  Startup investors work hard to find the best startups.  The government could not do better than to piggyback on their expertise, and use investment by recognized startup investors as the test of whether a company was a real startup.<br><br>How would the government decide who's a startup investor?  The same way they decide what counts as a university for student visas. We'll establish our own accreditation procedure. We know who one another are.<br><br>10,000 people is a drop in the bucket by immigration standards, but would represent a huge increase in the pool of startup founders.  I think this would have such a visible effect on the economy that it would make the legislator who introduced the bill famous.  The only way to know for sure would be to try it, and that would cost practically nothing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

to ask why Twitter is such a big deal.<br><br>The reason is that it's a new messaging 
protocol, where you don't specify the recipients.
New protocols are rare.  Or more precisely, new
protocols that take off are.
There are only a handful of commonly used ones: TCP/IP 
(the Internet), SMTP (email), HTTP (the web), and so on.  So any
new protocol is a big deal.  But Twitter is a protocol owned
by a private company.  That's even rarer.<br><br>Curiously, the fact that the founders of Twitter 
have been slow to monetize it may in the long run
prove to be an advantage.  Because they haven't tried
to control it too much, Twitter feels to everyone like
previous protocols.  One forgets it's owned by a
private company.  That must have made it easier for
Twitter to spread.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

I'm not sure of this, but there seems a decent chance it's true.  People are dramatically more 
<nota href="wealth.html">productive as founders or early employees of startups—imagine how much less Larry and Sergey would have achieved if they'd gone to work for a big company—and that scale of improvement can change social customs.<br><br>The second idea is that startups are a type of business that flourishes in certain places that <a href="startuphubs.html">specialize</a> in it—that Silicon Valley specializes in startups in the same way Los Angeles specializes in movies, or New York in finance. <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>What if both are true?  What if startups are both a new economic phase and also a type of business that only flourishes in certain centers?<br><br>If so, this revolution is going to be particularly revolutionary. All previous revolutions have spread.  Agriculture, cities, and industrialization all spread widely. If startups end up being like the movie business, with just a handful of centers and one dominant one, that's going to have novel consequences.<br><br>There are already signs that startups may not spread particularly well.  The spread of startups seems to be proceeding slower than the spread of the Industrial Revolution, despite the fact that communication is so much faster now.<br><br>Within a few decades of the founding of Boulton &amp; Watt there were steam engines scattered over northern Europe and North America.  Industrialization didn't spread much beyond those regions for a while. It only spread to places where there was a strong middle class—countries where a private citizen could make a fortune without having it confiscated. Otherwise it wasn't worth investing in factories.  But in a country with a strong middle class it was easy for industrial techniques to take root.  An individual mine or factory owner could decide to install a steam engine, and within a few years he could probably find someone local to make him one.  So steam engines spread fast.  And they spread widely, because the locations of mines and factories were determined by features like rivers, harbors, and sources of raw materials. 
 <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Startups don't seem to spread so well, partly because they're more a social than a technical phenomenon, and partly because they're not tied to geography.  An individual European manufacturer could import industrial techniques and they'd work fine.  This doesn't seem to work so well with startups: you need a community of expertise, as you do in the movie business.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
 Plus there aren't the same forces driving startups to spread.  Once railroads or electric power grids were invented, every region had to have them.  An area without railroads or power was a rich potential market.  But this isn't true with startups.  There's no need for a Microsoft of France or Google of Germany.<br><br>Governments may decide they want to encourage startups locally, but government policy can't call them into being the way a genuine need could.<br><br>How will this all play out?  If I had to predict now, I'd say that startups will spread, but very slowly, because their spread will be driven not by government policies (which won't work) or by market need (which doesn't exist) but, to the extent that it happens at all, by the same random factors that have caused startup culture to spread thus far.  And such random factors will increasingly be outweighed by the pull of existing startup hubs.<br><br>Silicon Valley is where it is because William Shockley wanted to move back to Palo Alto, where he grew up, and the experts he lured west to work with him liked it so much they stayed.  Seattle owes much of its position as a tech center to the same cause: Gates and Allen wanted to move home.  Otherwise Albuquerque might have Seattle's place in the rankings.  Boston is a tech center because it's the intellectual capital of the US and probably the world.  And if Battery Ventures hadn't turned down Facebook, Boston would be significantly bigger now on the startup radar screen.<br><br>But of course it's not a coincidence that Facebook got funded in the Valley and not Boston.  There are more and bolder investors in Silicon Valley than in Boston, and even undergrads know it.<br><br>Boston's case illustrates the difficulty you'd have establishing a new startup hub this late in the game.  If you wanted to create a startup hub by reproducing the way existing ones happened, the 
<a href="siliconvalley.html">way to do it</a> would be to establish a first-rate research university in a place so nice that rich people wanted to live there.  Then the town would be hospitable to both groups you need: both founders and investors.  That's the combination that yielded Silicon Valley.  But Silicon Valley didn't have Silicon Valley to compete with.  If you tried now to create a startup hub by planting a great university in a nice place, it would have a harder time getting started, because many of the best startups it produced would be sucked away to existing startup hubs.<br><br>Recently I suggested a potential shortcut: 
<a href="maybe.html">pay startups to move</a>.  Once you had enough good startups in one place, it would create a self-sustaining chain reaction.  Founders would start to move there without being paid, because that was where their peers were, and investors would appear too, because that was where the deals were.<br><br>In practice I doubt any government would have the balls to try this, or the brains to do it right.  I didn't mean it as a practical suggestion, but more as an exploration of the lower bound of what it would take to create a startup hub deliberately.<br><br>The most likely scenario is (1) that no government will successfully establish a startup hub, and (2) that the spread of startup culture will thus be driven by the random factors that have driven it so far, but (3) that these factors will be increasingly outweighed by the pull of existing startup hubs.  Result: this revolution, if it is one, will be unusually localized.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
There are two very different types of startup: one kind that evolves naturally, and one kind that's called into being to "commercialize" a scientific discovery.  Most computer/software startups are now the first type, and most pharmaceutical startups the second.  When I talk about startups in this essay, I mean type I startups.  There is no difficulty making type II startups spread: all you have to do is fund medical research labs; commercializing whatever new discoveries the boffins throw off is as straightforward as building a new airport.  Type II startups neither require nor produce startup culture. But that means having type II startups won't get you type I startups.  Philadelphia is a case in point: lots of type II startups, but hardly any type I.<br><br>Incidentally, Google may appear to be an instance of a type II startup, but it wasn't.  Google is not pagerank commercialized.  They could have used another algorithm and everything would have turned out the same.  What made Google Google is that they cared about doing search well at a critical point in the evolution of the web.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
 Watt didn't invent the steam engine.  His critical invention was a refinement that made steam engines dramatically more efficient: the separate condenser.  But that oversimplifies his role.  He had such a different attitude to the problem and approached it with such energy that he transformed the field.  Perhaps the most accurate way to put it would be to say that Watt reinvented the steam engine.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The biggest counterexample here is Skype.  If you're doing
something that would get shut down in the US, it becomes an 
advantage to be located elsewhere.  That's why Kazaa took
the place of Napster.  And the expertise and connections the 
founders gained from running Kazaa helped ensure the success
of Skype.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.<br><br></nota></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

July 2009<br><br>One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they're on
a different type of schedule from other people.  Meetings cost them
more.<br><br>There are two types of schedule, which I'll call the manager's
schedule and the maker's schedule.  The manager's schedule is for
bosses.  It's embodied in the traditional appointment book, with
each day cut into one hour intervals.  You can block off several
hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change
what you're doing every hour.<br><br>When you use time that way, it's merely a practical problem to meet
with someone.  Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, and
you're done.<br><br>Most powerful people are on the manager's schedule.  It's the
schedule of command.  But there's another way of using time that's
common among people who make things, like programmers and writers.
They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least.
You can't write or program well in units of an hour.  That's barely
enough time to get started.<br><br>When you're operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are a
disaster.  A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking
it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in.  Plus you
have to remember to go to the meeting.  That's no problem for someone
on the manager's schedule.  There's always something coming on the
next hour; the only question is what.  But when someone on the
maker's schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.<br><br>For someone on the maker's schedule, having a meeting is like
throwing an exception.  It doesn't merely cause you to switch from
one task to another; it changes the mode in which you work.<br><br>I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day.   A meeting
commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up a morning or
afternoon.  But in addition there's sometimes a cascading effect.
If I know the afternoon is going to be broken up, I'm slightly less
likely to start something ambitious in the morning.  I know this
may sound oversensitive, but if you're a maker, think of your own
case.  Don't your spirits rise at the thought of having an entire
day free to work, with no appointments at all?  Well, that means
your spirits are correspondingly depressed when you don't.  And
ambitious projects are by definition close to the limits of your
capacity.  A small decrease in morale is enough to kill them off.<br><br>Each type of schedule works fine by itself.  Problems arise when
they meet.  Since most powerful people operate on the manager's
schedule, they're in a position to make everyone resonate at their
frequency if they want to.  But the smarter ones restrain themselves,
if they know that some of the people working for them need long
chunks of time to work in.<br><br>Our case is an unusual one.  Nearly all investors, including all
VCs I know, operate on the manager's schedule.  But 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>
runs on the maker's schedule.  Rtm and Trevor and I do because we
always have, and Jessica does too, mostly, because she's gotten
into sync with us.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if there start to be more companies like
us.  I suspect founders may increasingly be able to resist, or at
least postpone, turning into managers, just as a few decades ago
they started to be able to resist switching from jeans
to suits.<br><br>How do we manage to advise so many startups on the maker's schedule?
By using the classic device for simulating the manager's schedule
within the maker's: office hours.  Several times a week I set aside
a chunk of time to meet founders we've funded.  These chunks of
time are at the end of my working day, and I wrote a signup program
that ensures all the appointments within a given set of office hours
are clustered at the end.  Because they come at the end of my day
these meetings are never an interruption.  (Unless their working
day ends at the same time as mine, the meeting presumably interrupts
theirs, but since they made the appointment it must be worth it to
them.)  During busy periods, office hours sometimes get long enough
that they compress the day, but they never interrupt it.<br><br>
When we were working on <a href="start.html"><font color="#000099">our own startup</font></a>, back in the 90s, I evolved
another trick for partitioning the day.  I used to program from
dinner till about 3 am every day, because at night no one could
interrupt me.  Then I'd sleep till about 11 am, and come in and
work until dinner on what I called "business stuff."  I never thought
of it in these terms, but in effect I had two workdays each day,
one on the manager's schedule and one on the maker's.<br><br>When you're operating on the manager's schedule you can do something
you'd never want to do on the maker's: you can have speculative
meetings.  You can meet someone just to get to know one another.
If you have an empty slot in your schedule, why not?  Maybe it will
turn out you can help one another in some way.<br><br>Business people in Silicon Valley (and the whole world, for that
matter) have speculative meetings all the time.  They're effectively
free if you're on the manager's schedule.  They're so common that
there's distinctive language for proposing them: saying that you
want to "grab coffee," for example.<br><br>Speculative meetings are terribly costly if you're on the maker's
schedule, though.  Which puts us in something of a bind.  Everyone
assumes that, like other investors, we run on the manager's schedule.
So they introduce us to someone they think we ought to meet, or
send us an email proposing we grab coffee.  At this point we have
two options, neither of them good: we can meet with them, and lose
half a day's work; or we can try to avoid meeting them, and probably
offend them.<br><br>Till recently we weren't clear in our own minds about the source
of the problem.  We just took it for granted that we had to either
blow our schedules or offend people.  But now that I've realized
what's going on, perhaps there's a third option: to write something
explaining the two types of schedule.  Maybe eventually, if the
conflict between the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule
starts to be more widely understood, it will become less of a
problem.<br><br>Those of us on the maker's schedule are willing to compromise.   We
know we have to have some number of meetings.  All we ask from those

<p>
July 2009<br><br>Now that the term "ramen profitable" has become widespread, I ought
to explain precisely what the idea entails.<br><br>Ramen profitable means a startup makes just enough to pay the
founders' living expenses.  This is a different form of profitability
than startups have traditionally aimed for.  Traditional profitability
means a big bet is finally paying off, whereas the main importance
of ramen profitability is that it buys you time.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>In the past, a startup would usually become profitable only
after raising and spending quite a lot of money.  A company making
computer hardware might not become profitable for 5 years, during
which they spent $50 million.  But when they did
they might have revenues of $50 million a year.   This kind of
profitability means the startup has succeeded.<br><br>Ramen profitability is the other extreme: a startup that becomes
profitable after 2 months, even though its revenues are only $3000
a month, because the only employees are a couple 25 year old founders
who can live on practically nothing.  Revenues of $3000 a month do
not mean the company has succeeded.
But it does share something with the one
that's profitable in the traditional way: they don't need to raise
money to survive.<br><br>Ramen profitability is an unfamiliar idea to most people because
it only recently became feasible.  It's still not feasible for a
lot of startups; it would not be for most biotech startups, for
example; but it is for many software startups because they're now
so cheap.  For many, the only real cost is the founders'
living expenses.<br><br>The main significance of this type of profitability is that you're
no longer at the mercy of investors.  If you're still losing money,
then eventually you'll either have to raise more
or shut down.  Once you're
ramen profitable this painful choice goes away.
You can still raise money, but you don't have to do it now.<br><br></p><center>* * *</center><br><br>The most obvious advantage of not needing money is that
you can get better terms.  If investors know you need money, they'll
sometimes take advantage of you.  Some may even deliberately
stall, because they know that as you run out of money you'll become
increasingly pliable.<br><br>But there are also three less obvious advantages of ramen profitability.
One is that it makes you more attractive to investors.  If you're
already profitable, on however small a scale, it shows that (a) you
can get at least someone to pay you, (b) you're serious about
building things people want, and (c) you're disciplined enough to
keep expenses low.<br><br>This is reassuring to investors, because you've addressed three of
their biggest worries.  It's common for them to fund companies that
have smart founders and a big market, and yet still fail.  When
these companies fail, it's usually because (a) people wouldn't pay
for what they made, e.g. because it was too hard to sell to them,
or the market wasn't ready yet, (b) the founders solved the wrong
problem, instead of paying attention to what users needed, or (c)
the company spent too much and burned through their funding before
they started to make money.  If you're ramen profitable, you're
already avoiding these mistakes.<br><br>Another advantage of ramen profitability is that it's good for
morale.  A company
tends to feel rather theoretical when you first start it.  It's
legally a company, but you feel like you're lying when you call it
one.  When people start to pay you significant amounts, the company
starts to feel real.  And your own living expenses are the milestone
you feel most, because at that point the future flips state.  Now
survival is the default, instead of dying.<br><br>A morale boost on that scale is very valuable in a startup, because
the moral weight of running a startup is what makes it hard.  Startups
are still very rare.  Why don't more people do it?  The financial
risk?  Plenty of 25 year olds save nothing anyway.  The long hours?
Plenty of people work just as long hours in regular jobs. What keeps
people from starting startups is the fear of having so much
responsibility.  And this is not an irrational fear: it really is
hard to bear.  Anything that takes some of that weight off you will 
greatly increase your chances of surviving.<br><br>A startup that reaches ramen profitability may be more likely
to succeed than not.  Which is pretty exciting, considering the
bimodal distribution of outcomes in startups: you either fail or
make a lot of money.<br><br>The fourth advantage of ramen profitability is the least obvious
but may be the most important.  If you don't need to raise money,
you don't have to interrupt working on the company to do it.<br><br><a href="fundraising.html">Raising money</a> is terribly distracting.  
You're lucky if your
productivity is a third of what it was before.  And it can last for
months.<br><br>I didn't understand (or rather, remember) precisely why raising
money was so distracting till earlier this year.  I'd noticed that
startups we funded would usually grind to a halt when they switched
to raising money, but I didn't remember exactly why till YC raised
money itself.  We had a comparatively easy time of it; the first
people I asked said yes; but it took months to work out the
details, and during that time I got hardly any real work done.  Why?
Because I thought about it all the time.<br><br>At any given time there tends to be one problem that's the most
urgent for a startup.  This is what you think about as you fall
asleep at night and when you take a shower in the morning.  And
when you start raising money, that becomes the problem you think
about.  You only take one shower in the morning, and if you're
thinking about investors during it, then you're not thinking about
the product.<br><br>Whereas if you can choose when you raise money, you can pick a time
when you're not in the middle of something else, and you can probably
also insist that the round close fast.  You may even be able to
avoid having the round occupy your thoughts, if you don't care
whether it closes.<br><br><center>* * *</center><br><br>Ramen profitable means no more than the definition implies.  It
does not, for example, imply that you're "bootstrapping" the
startup—that you're never going to take money from investors.
Empirically that doesn't seem to work very well.  Few startups
succeed without taking investment.  Maybe as startups get cheaper
it will become more common.  On the other hand, the money is there,
waiting to be invested.  If startups need it less, they'll be able
to get it on better terms, which will make them more inclined to
take it.  That will tend to produce an equilibrium.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another thing ramen profitability doesn't imply is Joe Kraus's idea
that you should put your 
<a href="http://www.brendonwilson.com/blog/2006/04/30/joe-kraus-confessions-of-a-startup-addict/">business model</a> in beta when you put your
product in beta.  He believes you should get
people to pay you from the beginning.  I think that's too constraining.
Facebook didn't, and they've done better than most startups.  Making
money right away was not only unnecessary for them, but probably
would have been harmful.  I do think Joe's rule could be useful for
many startups, though.  When founders seem unfocused, I sometimes
suggest they try to get customers to pay them for something, in the
hope that this constraint will prod them into action.<br><br>The difference between Joe's idea and ramen profitability is that
a ramen profitable company doesn't have to be making money the way
it ultimately will.  It just has to be making money.  The most
famous example is Google, which initially made money by licensing
search to sites like Yahoo.<br><br>Is there a downside to ramen profitability?  Probably the biggest
danger is that it might turn you into a consulting firm.  Startups
have to be product companies, in the sense of making a single thing
that everyone uses.  The defining quality of startups is that they
grow fast, and consulting just can't scale the way a product can.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
But it's pretty easy to make $3000 a month consulting; in
fact, that would be a low rate for contract programming.  So there
could be a temptation to slide into consulting, and telling
yourselves you're a ramen profitable startup, when in fact
you're not a startup at all.<br><br>It's ok to do a little consulting-type work at first.  Startups
usually have to do something weird at first.  But remember
that ramen profitability is not the destination.  A startup's
destination is to grow really big; ramen profitability is a trick
for <a href="die.html">not dying</a> en route.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
The "ramen" in "ramen profitable" refers to instant ramen,
which is just about the cheapest food available.<br><br>Please do not take the term literally.  Living on instant ramen
would be very unhealthy.  Rice and beans are a better source of
food.  Start by investing in a rice cooker, if you don't have one.<br><br>Rice and Beans for 2n
<pre>  olive oil or butter
  n yellow onions
  other fresh vegetables; experiment
  3n cloves garlic
  n 12-oz cans white, kidney, or black beans
  n cubes Knorr beef or vegetable bouillon
  n teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
  3n teaspoons ground cumin
  n cups dry rice, preferably brown
</pre>
Put rice in rice cooker. Add water as specified on rice package.
(Default: 2 cups water per cup of rice.) Turn on rice cooker and
forget about it.<br><br>Chop onions and other vegetables and fry in oil, over fairly low
heat, till onions are glassy. Put in chopped garlic, pepper, cumin,
and a little more fat, and stir.  Keep heat low. Cook another 2 or
3 minutes, then add beans (don't drain the beans), and stir. Throw
in the bouillon cube(s), cover, and cook on lowish heat for at least
10 minutes more. Stir vigilantly to avoid sticking.<br><br>If you want to save money, buy beans in giant cans from discount
stores.  Spices are also much cheaper when bought in bulk.
If there's an Indian grocery store near you, they'll have big 
bags of cumin for the same price as the little jars in supermarkets.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There's a good chance that a shift in power from investors
to founders would actually increase the size of the venture business.
I think investors currently err too far on the side of being harsh
to founders.  If they were forced to stop, the whole venture business
would work better, and you might see something like the increase
in trade you always see when restrictive laws are removed.<br><br>Investors
are one of the biggest sources of pain for founders; if they stopped
causing so much pain, it would be better to be a founder; and if
it were better to be a founder, more people would do it.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
It's conceivable that a startup could grow big by transforming
consulting into a form that would scale.  But if they did that
they'd really be a product company.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/serious-2.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://note.com/tokyojack/n/n612e835ac15c">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

There are several reasons why, but one is that people don't want
to be seen riding them. Someone riding a Segway looks like a dork.<br><br>My friend Trevor Blackwell built 
<a href="http://tlb.org/#scooter">his own Segway</a>, 
which we called
the Segwell. He also built a one-wheeled version, 
<a href="http://tlb.org/#eunicycle">the Eunicycle</a>,
which looks exactly like a regular unicycle till you realize the
rider isn't pedaling.  He has ridden them both to downtown Mountain
View to get coffee.  When he rides the Eunicycle, people smile at
him.  But when he rides the Segwell, they shout abuse from their
cars: "Too lazy to walk, ya fuckin homo?"<br><br>Why do Segways provoke this reaction?  The reason you look like a
dork riding a Segway is that you look <i>smug</i>.  You don't seem to
be working hard enough.<br><br>Someone riding a motorcycle isn't working any harder. But because
he's sitting astride it, he seems to be making an effort.  When
you're riding a Segway you're just standing there.  And someone who's
being whisked along while seeming to do no work — someone in a sedan
chair, for example — can't help but look smug.<br><br>Try this thought experiment and it becomes clear: imagine something
that worked like the Segway, but that you rode with one foot in
front of the other, like a skateboard.  That wouldn't seem nearly
as uncool.<br><br>So there may be a way to capture more of the market Segway hoped
to reach: make a version that doesn't look so easy for the rider.
It would also be helpful if the styling was in the tradition of
skateboards or bicycles rather than medical devices.<br><br>Curiously enough, what got Segway into this problem was that the
company was itself a kind of Segway.  It was too easy for them;
they were too successful raising money.  If they'd had to grow the
company gradually, by iterating through several versions they sold
to real users, they'd have learned pretty quickly that people looked
stupid riding them. Instead they had enough to work in secret.  They
had focus groups aplenty, I'm sure, but they didn't have the people
yelling insults out of cars.  So they never realized they were
zooming confidently down a blind alley.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

Recently we managed to recruit her to help us run YC when she's not
busy with architectural projects.  Though she'd heard a lot about
YC since the beginning, the last 9 months have been a total immersion.<br><br>I've been around the startup world for so long that it seems normal
to me, so I was curious to hear what had surprised her most about
it.  This was her list:<br><br><br><br><b>1. How many startups fail.</b><br><br>Kate knew in principle that startups
were very risky, but she was surprised to see how constant the
threat of failure was — not just for the minnows, but even for the
famous startups whose founders came to speak at YC dinners.<br><br>
<b>2. How much startups' ideas change.</b><br><br>As usual, by Demo Day about
half the startups were doing something significantly different than
they started with.  We encourage that.  Starting a startup is like
science in that you have to follow the truth wherever it leads.  In
the rest of the world, people don't start things till they're sure
what they want to do, and once started they tend to continue on their
initial path even if it's mistaken.<br><br>
<b>3. How little money it can take to start a startup.</b><br><br>In Kate's
world, everything is still physical and expensive.  You can barely
renovate a bathroom for the cost of starting a startup.<br><br>
<b>4. How scrappy founders are.</b><br><br>That was her actual word.  I agree
with her, but till she mentioned this it never occurred to me how
little this quality is appreciated in most of the rest of the world.
It wouldn't be a compliment in most organizations to call someone
scrappy.<br><br>What does it mean, exactly?  It's basically the diminutive form of
belligerent.  Someone who's scrappy manages to be both threatening
and undignified at the same time.   Which seems to me exactly what
one would want to be, in any kind of work.  If you're not threatening,
you're probably not doing anything new, and dignity is merely a
sort of plaque.<br><br>
<b>5. How tech-saturated Silicon Valley is.</b><br><br>"It seems like everybody
here is in the industry."  That isn't literally true, but there is
a qualitative difference between Silicon Valley and other places.
You tend to keep your voice down, because there's a good chance the
person at the next table would know some of the people you're talking
about.  I never felt that in Boston.  The good news is, there's
also a good chance the person at the next table could help you in
some way.<br><br>
<b>6. That the speakers at YC were so consistent in their advice.</b><br><br>
Actually, I've noticed this too.  I always worry the speakers will
put us in an embarrassing position by contradicting what we tell the
startups, but it happens surprisingly rarely.<br><br>When I asked her what specific things she remembered speakers always
saying, she mentioned: that the way to succeed was to launch something
fast, listen to users, and then iterate; that startups required
resilience because they were always an emotional rollercoaster; and
that most VCs were sheep.<br><br>I've been impressed by how consistently the speakers advocate
launching fast and iterating.  That was contrarian advice 10 years
ago, but it's clearly now the established practice.<br><br>
<b>7. How casual successful startup founders are.</b><br><br>Most of the famous
founders in Silicon Valley are people you'd overlook on the street.
It's not merely that they don't dress up.  They don't project any
kind of aura of power either.  "They're not trying to impress
anyone."<br><br>Interestingly, while Kate said that she could never pick out
successful founders, she could recognize VCs, both by the way they
dressed and the way they carried themselves.<br><br>
<b>8. How important it is for founders to have people to ask for advice.</b><br><br>(I swear I didn't prompt this one.)  Without advice "they'd just
be sort of lost."  Fortunately, there are a lot of people to help
them.  There's a strong tradition within YC of helping other YC-funded
startups.  But we didn't invent that idea: it's just a slightly
more concentrated form of existing Valley culture.<br><br>
<b>9. What a solitary task startups are.</b><br><br>Architects are constantly
interacting face to face with other people, whereas doing a technology
startup, at least, tends to require long stretches of uninterrupted
time to work.  "You could do it in a box."<br><br><br><br>By inverting this list, we can get a portrait of the "normal" world.
It's populated by people who talk a lot with one another as they
work slowly but harmoniously on conservative, expensive projects
whose destinations are decided in advance, and who carefully adjust
their manner to reflect their position in the hierarchy.<br><br>That's also a fairly accurate description of the past.  So startup
culture may not merely be different in the way you'd expect any
subculture to be, but a leading indicator.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://note.com/tokyojack/n/n00714ac4042a">Japanese Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
September 2009<br><br>Like all investors, we spend a lot of time trying to learn how to
predict which startups will succeed.  We probably spend more time
thinking about it than most, because we invest the earliest.
Prediction is usually all we have to rely on.<br><br>We learned quickly that the most important predictor of success is
determination.  At first we thought it might be intelligence.
Everyone likes to believe that's what makes startups succeed.  It
makes a better story that a company won because its founders were
so smart.  The PR people and reporters who spread such stories
probably believe them themselves.  But while it certainly helps to
be smart, it's not the deciding factor.  There are plenty of people
as smart as Bill Gates who achieve nothing.<br><br>In most domains, talent is overrated compared to determination—partly
because it makes a better story, partly because it gives onlookers
an excuse for being lazy, and partly because after a while determination
starts to look like talent.<br><br>I can't think of any field in which determination is overrated, but
the relative importance of determination and talent probably do
vary somewhat.  Talent probably matters more in types of work that
are purer, in the sense that one is solving mostly a single type
of problem instead of many different types.   I suspect determination
would not take you as far in math as it would in, say, organized
crime.<br><br>I don't mean to suggest by this comparison that types of work that
depend more on talent are always more admirable.  Most people would
agree it's more admirable to be good at math than memorizing long
strings of digits, even though the latter depends more on natural
ability.<br><br>Perhaps one reason people believe startup founders win by being
smarter is that intelligence does matter more in technology startups
than it used to in earlier types of companies.  You probably do
need to be a bit smarter to dominate Internet search than you had
to be to dominate railroads or hotels or newspapers.  And that's
probably an ongoing trend.  But even in the highest of high tech
industries, success still depends more on determination than brains.<br><br>If determination is so important, can we isolate its components?
Are some more important than others?  Are there some you can
cultivate?<br><br>The simplest form of determination is sheer willfulness.  When you
want something, you must have it, no matter what.<br><br>A good deal of willfulness must be inborn, because it's common to
see families where one sibling has much more of it than another.
Circumstances can alter it, but at the high end of the scale, nature
seems to be more important than nurture.  Bad circumstances can
break the spirit of a strong-willed person, but I don't think there's
much you can do to make a weak-willed person stronger-willed.<br><br>Being strong-willed is not enough, however.  You also have to be
hard on yourself.  Someone who was strong-willed but self-indulgent
would not be called determined.  Determination implies your willfulness
is balanced by discipline.<br><br>That word balance is a significant one.  The more willful you are,
the more disciplined you have to be.  The stronger your will, the
less anyone will be able to argue with you except yourself.  And
someone has to argue with you, because everyone has base impulses,
and if you have more will than discipline you'll just give into
them and end up on a local maximum like drug addiction.<br><br>We can imagine will and discipline as two fingers squeezing a
slippery melon seed.  The harder they squeeze, the further the seed
flies, but they must both squeeze equally or the seed spins off
sideways.<br><br>If this is true it has interesting implications, because discipline
can be cultivated, and in fact does tend to vary quite a lot in the
course of an individual's life.  If determination is effectively
the product of will and discipline, then you can become more
determined by being more disciplined.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another consequence of the melon seed model is that the more willful
you are, the more dangerous it is to be undisciplined.  There seem
to be plenty of examples to confirm that.  In some very energetic
people's lives you see something like wing flutter, where they
alternate between doing great work and doing absolutely nothing.
Externally this would look a lot like bipolar disorder.<br><br>The melon seed model is inaccurate in at least one respect, however:
it's static.  In fact the dangers of indiscipline increase with
temptation.  Which means, interestingly, that determination tends
to erode itself.  If you're sufficiently determined to achieve great
things, this will probably increase the number of temptations around
you.  Unless you become proportionally more disciplined, willfulness
will then get the upper hand, and your achievement will revert to
the mean.<br><br>That's why Shakespeare's Caesar thought thin men so dangerous.  They weren't
tempted by the minor perquisites of power.<br><br>The melon seed model implies it's possible to be too disciplined.
Is it?  I think there probably are people whose willfulness is
crushed down by excessive discipline, and who would achieve more
if they weren't so hard on themselves.  One reason the young sometimes
succeed where the old fail is that they don't realize how incompetent
they are.  This lets them do a kind of deficit spending.  When they
first start working on something, they overrate their achievements.
But that gives them confidence to keep working, and their performance
improves.  Whereas someone clearer-eyed would see their initial
incompetence for what it was, and perhaps be discouraged from
continuing.<br><br>There's one other major component of determination: ambition.  If
willfulness and discipline are what get you to your destination,
ambition is how you choose it.<br><br>I don't know if it's exactly right to say that ambition is a component
of determination, but they're not entirely orthogonal.  It would
seem a misnomer if someone said they were very determined to do
something trivially easy.<br><br>And fortunately ambition seems to be quite malleable; there's a lot
you can do to increase it.  Most people don't know how ambitious
to be, especially when they're young.  They don't know what's hard,
or what they're capable of.  And this problem is exacerbated by
having few peers.  Ambitious people are rare, so if everyone is
mixed together randomly, as they tend to be early in people's lives,
then the ambitious ones won't have many ambitious peers.  When you
take people like this and put them together with other ambitious
people, they bloom like dying plants given water.  Probably most
ambitious people are starved for the sort of encouragement they'd
get from ambitious peers, whatever their age.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Achievements also tend to increase your ambition.  With each step
you gain confidence to stretch further next time.<br><br>So here in sum is how determination seems to work: it consists of
willfulness balanced with discipline, aimed by ambition.   And
fortunately at least two of these three qualities can be cultivated.
You may be able to increase your strength of will somewhat; you can
definitely learn self-discipline; and almost everyone is practically
malnourished when it comes to ambition.<br><br>I feel like I understand determination a bit better now.  But only
a bit: willfulness, discipline, and ambition are all concepts almost
as complicated as determination.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Note too that determination and talent are not the whole story.
There's a third factor in achievement: how much you like the work.
If you really <a href="love.html">love</a> working on something,
you don't need determination to drive you; it's what you'd do anyway.
But most types of work have aspects one doesn't like, because most
types of work consist of doing things for other people, and it's
very unlikely that the tasks imposed by their needs will happen to
align exactly with what you want to do.<br><br>Indeed, if you want to create the most <a href="wealth.html">wealth</a>,
the way to do it is to focus more on their needs than your interests,
and make up the difference with determination.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Loosely speaking.  What I'm claiming with the melon seed model
is more like determination is proportionate to wd^m - k|w - d|^n,
where w is will and d discipline.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Which means one of the best ways to help a society generally
is to create <a href="http://startupschool.org">events</a> and <a href="http://ycombinator.com">institutions</a> that bring ambitious
people together.  It's like pulling the control rods out of a
reactor: the energy they emit encourages other ambitious people,
instead of being absorbed by the normal people they're usually
surrounded with.<br><br>Conversely, it's probably a mistake to do as some European countries
have done and try to ensure none of your universities is significantly
better than the others.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
For example, willfulness clearly has two subcomponents,
stubbornness and energy.  The first alone yields someone who's
stubbornly inert.  The second alone yields someone flighty.
As willful people get older or otherwise lose their energy, they
tend to become merely stubborn.<br><br>

whose title begins with a number. "7 Things He Won't Tell You about
Sex," or something like that.  Some popular magazines
feature articles of this type on the cover of every
issue.  That can't be happening by accident.  Editors must know
they attract readers.<br><br>Why do readers like the list of n things so much?   Mainly because
it's easier to read than a regular article.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
Structurally, the list of n things is a degenerate case of essay.
An essay can go anywhere the writer wants.  In a list of n things
the writer agrees to constrain himself to a collection of points
of roughly equal importance, and he tells the reader explicitly
what they are.<br><br>Some of the work of reading an article is understanding its
structure—figuring out what in high school we'd have called
its "outline." Not explicitly, of course, but someone who really
understands an article probably has something in his brain afterward
that corresponds to such an outline.  In a list of n things, this
work is done for you.  Its structure is an exoskeleton.<br><br>As well as being explicit, the structure is guaranteed to be of the
simplest possible type: a few main points with few to no subordinate
ones, and no particular connection between them.<br><br>Because the main points are unconnected, the list of n things is
random access.  There's no thread of reasoning you have to follow.  You could
read the list in any order.  And because the points are independent
of one another, they work like watertight compartments in an
unsinkable ship.  If you get bored with, or can't understand, or
don't agree with one point, you don't have to give up on the article.
You can just abandon that one and skip to the next.  A list of n
things is parallel and therefore fault tolerant.<br><br>There are times when this format is what a writer wants.  One, obviously,
is when what you have to say actually is a list of n
things.  I once wrote an essay about the <a href="startupmistakes.html">mistakes that kill startups</a>, and a few people made fun of me
for writing something whose title began with a number.  But in that
case I really was trying to make a complete catalog of a number of
independent things.  In fact, one of the questions I was trying to
answer was how many there were.<br><br>There are other less legitimate reasons for using this format.  For
example, I use it when I get close to a deadline.  If I have to
give a talk and I haven't started it a few days beforehand, I'll
sometimes play it safe and make the talk a list of n things.<br><br>The list of n things is easier for writers as well as readers.  When
you're writing a real essay, there's always a chance you'll hit a
dead end.  A real essay is a train of thought, and some trains of
thought just peter out.  That's an alarming possibility when you
have to give a talk in a few days.  What if you run out of ideas?
The compartmentalized structure of the list of n things protects
the writer from his own stupidity in much the same way it protects
the reader.  If you run out of ideas on one point, no problem: it
won't kill the essay.  You can take out the whole point if you need
to, and the essay will still survive.<br><br>Writing a list of n things is so relaxing.  You think of n/2 of
them in the first 5 minutes.  So bang, there's the structure, and
you just have to fill it in.  As you think of more points, you just
add them to the end.  Maybe you take out or rearrange or combine a
few, but at every stage you have a valid (though initially low-res)
list of n things.  It's like the sort of programming where you write
a version 1 very quickly and then gradually modify it, but at every
point have working code—or the style of painting where you begin
with a complete but very blurry sketch done in an hour, then spend
a week cranking up the resolution.<br><br>Because the list of n things is easier for writers too, it's not
always a damning sign when readers prefer it.  It's not necessarily
evidence readers are lazy; it could also mean they don't have
much confidence in the writer.  The list of n things is in that
respect the cheeseburger of essay forms.  If you're eating at a
restaurant you suspect is bad, your best bet is to order the
cheeseburger.  Even a bad cook can make a decent cheeseburger.  And
there are pretty strict conventions about what a cheeseburger should
look like.  You can assume the cook isn't going to try something
weird and artistic.  The list of n things similarly limits the
damage that can be done by a bad writer.  You know it's going to
be about whatever the title says, and the format prevents the writer
from indulging in any flights of fancy.<br><br>Because the list of n things is the easiest essay form, it should
be a good one for beginning writers.  And in fact it is what most
beginning writers are taught.  The classic 5 paragraph essay is
really a list of n things for n = 3.  But the students writing them
don't realize they're using the same structure as the articles they
read in <i>Cosmopolitan</i>. They're not allowed to include the numbers,
and they're expected to spackle over the gaps with gratuitous
transitions ("Furthermore...") and cap the thing at either end with
introductory and concluding paragraphs so it will look superficially
like a real essay.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>It seems a fine plan to start students off with the list of n things.
It's the easiest form.  But if we're going to do that, why not do
it openly?  Let them write lists of n things like the pros, with
numbers and no transitions or "conclusion."<br><br>There is one case where the list of n things is a dishonest format:
when you use it to attract attention by falsely claiming the list
is an exhaustive one.  I.e. if you write an article that purports
to be about <i>the</i> 7 secrets of success.  That kind of title is the
same sort of reflexive challenge as a whodunit. You have to at least
look at the article to check whether they're the same 7 you'd list.
Are you overlooking one of the secrets of success?  Better check.<br><br>It's fine to put "The" before the number if you really believe
you've made an exhaustive list.  But evidence suggests most things
with titles like this are linkbait.<br><br>The greatest weakness of the list of n things is that there's so
little room for new thought.  The main point of essay writing, when
done right, is the new ideas you have while doing it.  A real essay,
as the name implies, is 
<a href="essay.html">dynamic</a>: you don't know what you're going
to write when you start.  It will be about whatever you discover
in the course of writing it.<br><br>This can only happen in a very limited way in a list of n things.
You make the title first, and that's what it's going to be about.
You can't have more new ideas in the writing than will fit in the
watertight compartments you set up initially.  And your brain seems
to know this: because you don't have room for new ideas, you don't
have them.<br><br>Another advantage of admitting to beginning writers that the 5
paragraph essay is really a list of n things is that we can warn
them about this.  It only lets you experience the defining
characteristic of essay writing on a small scale: in thoughts of a
sentence or two.  And it's particularly dangerous that the 5 paragraph
essay buries the list of n things within something that looks like
a more sophisticated type of essay.  If you don't know you're using
this form, you don't know you need to escape it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Articles of this type are also startlingly popular on Delicious,
but I think that's because 
<a href="http://delicious.com/popular">delicious/popular</a> 
is driven by bookmarking,
not because Delicious users are stupid.  Delicious users are
collectors, and a list of n things seems particularly collectible
because it's a collection itself.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Most "word problems" in school math textbooks are similarly
misleading.  They look superficially like the application of math
to real problems, but they're not.  So if anything they reinforce
the impression that math is merely a complicated but pointless
collection of stuff to be memorized.<br><br><br><br><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://iggant.blogspot.com/2009/09/n-paul-graham-list-of-n-things.html">Russian Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

consumers won't pay for content anymore.  At least, that's how they
see it.<br><br>In fact consumers never really were paying for content, and publishers
weren't really selling it either.  If the content was what they
were selling, why has the price of books or music or movies always
depended mostly on the format?  Why didn't better content cost more?
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>A copy of <i>Time</i> costs $5 for 58 pages, or 8.6 cents a page.  
<i>The Economist</i> costs $7 for 86 pages, or 8.1 cents a page.  Better
journalism is actually slightly cheaper.<br><br>Almost every form of publishing has been organized as if the medium
was what they were selling, and the content was irrelevant.  Book
publishers, for example, set prices based on the cost of producing
and distributing books.  They treat the words printed in the book
the same way a textile manufacturer treats the patterns printed on
its fabrics.<br><br>Economically, the print media are in the business of marking up
paper.  We can all imagine an old-style editor getting a scoop and
saying "this will sell a lot of papers!" Cross out that final S and
you're describing their business model.  The reason they make less
money now is that people don't need as much paper.<br><br>A few months ago I ran into a friend in a cafe.  I had a copy of
the <i>New York Times</i>, which I still occasionally buy on weekends.  As
I was leaving I offered it to him, as I've done countless times
before in the same situation.  But this time something new happened.
I felt that sheepish feeling you get when you offer someone something
worthless.  "Do you, er, want a printout of yesterday's news?" I
asked.  (He didn't.)<br><br>Now that the medium is evaporating, publishers have nothing left
to sell.  Some seem to think they're going to sell content—that
they were always in the content business, really.  But they weren't,
and it's unclear whether anyone could be.<br><br><b>Selling</b><br><br>There have always been people in the business of selling information,
but that has historically been a distinct business from publishing.
And the business of selling information to consumers has always
been a marginal one.  When I was a kid there were people who used
to sell newsletters containing stock tips, printed on colored paper
that made them hard for the copiers of the day to reproduce.  That
is a different world, both culturally and economically, from the
one publishers currently inhabit.<br><br>People will pay for information they think they can make money from.
That's why they paid for those stock tip newsletters, and why
companies pay now for Bloomberg terminals and Economist Intelligence
Unit reports.  But will people pay for information otherwise?
History offers little encouragement.<br><br>If audiences were willing to pay more for better content, why wasn't
anyone already selling it to them?  There was no reason you couldn't
have done that in the era of physical media.  So were the print
media and the music labels simply overlooking this opportunity?  Or
is it, rather, nonexistent?<br><br>What about iTunes?  Doesn't that show people will pay for content?
Well, not really. iTunes is more of a tollbooth than a store.  Apple
controls the default path onto the iPod.  They offer a convenient
list of songs, and whenever you choose one they ding your credit
card for a small amount, just below the threshold of attention.
Basically, iTunes makes money by taxing people, not selling them
stuff.  You can only do that if you own the channel, and even then
you don't make much from it, because a toll has to be ignorable to
work.  Once a toll becomes painful, people start to find ways around
it, and that's pretty easy with digital content.<br><br>The situation is much the same with digital books.  Whoever controls
the device sets the terms.  It's in their interest for content to
be as cheap as possible, and since they own the channel, there's a
lot they can do to drive prices down.  Prices will fall even further
once writers realize they don't need publishers.  Getting a book
printed and distributed is a daunting prospect for a writer, but
most can upload a file.<br><br>Is software a counterexample?  People pay a lot for desktop software,
and that's just information.  True, but I don't think publishers
can learn much from software.  Software companies can charge a lot
because (a) many of the customers are businesses, who get in 
<a href="http://www.bsa.org/country/News%20and%20Events/News%20Archives/en/2009/en-08312009-mueller.aspx?sc_lang=en">trouble</a>
if they use pirated versions, and (b) though in form merely
information, software is treated by both maker and purchaser as a
different type of thing from a song or an article.   A Photoshop
user needs Photoshop in a way that no one needs a particular song
or article.<br><br>That's why there's a separate word, "content," for information
that's not software.  Software is a different business.  Software
and content blur together in some of the most lightweight software,
like casual games.  But those are usually free.   To make money the
way software companies do, publishers would have to become software
companies, and being publishers gives them no particular head start
in that domain. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The most promising countertrend is the premium cable channel.  People
still pay for those.  But broadcasting isn't publishing: you're not
selling a copy of something.  That's one reason the movie business
hasn't seen their revenues decline the way the news and music
businesses have.  They only have one foot in publishing.<br><br>To the extent the movie business can avoid becoming publishers,
they may avoid publishing's problems.  But there are limits to how
well they'll be able to do that.  Once publishing—giving people
copies—becomes the most natural way of distributing your content,
it probably doesn't work to stick to old forms of distribution just
because you make more that way.  If free copies of your content are
available online, then you're competing with publishing's form of
distribution, and that's just as bad as being a publisher.<br><br>Apparently some people in the music business hope to retroactively
convert it away from publishing, by getting listeners to pay for
subscriptions.  It seems unlikely that will work if they're just
streaming the same files you can get as mp3s.<br><br><b>Next</b><br><br>What happens to publishing if you can't sell content?  You have two
choices: give it away and make money from it indirectly, or find
ways to embody it in things people will pay for.<br><br>The first is probably the future of most current media.  
<a href="http://thesixtyone.com">Give music
away</a> and make money from concerts and t-shirts.  Publish articles
for free and make money from one of a dozen permutations of
advertising.  Both publishers and investors are down on advertising
at the moment, but it has more potential than they realize.<br><br>I'm not claiming that potential will be realized by the existing
players.  The <a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs1.html">optimal</a>
ways to make money from the written word
probably require different words written by different people.<br><br>It's harder to say what will happen to movies.  They could evolve
into ads.  Or they could return to their roots and make going to
the theater a treat.  If they made the experience good enough,
audiences might start to prefer it to watching pirated movies at
home. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Or maybe the movie business will dry up, and the people
working in it will go to work for game developers.<br><br>I don't know how big embodying information in physical form will
be.  It may be surprisingly large; people overvalue 
<a href="stuff.html">physical stuff</a>.
There should remain some market for printed books, at least.<br><br>I can see the evolution of book publishing in the books on my
shelves.  Clearly at some point in the 1960s the big publishing
houses started to ask: how cheaply can we make books before people
refuse to buy them?  The answer turned out to be one step short of
phonebooks.  As long as it isn't floppy, consumers still perceive
it as a book.<br><br>That worked as long as buying printed books was the only way to
read them.  If printed books are optional, publishers will have to
work harder to entice people to buy them.  There should be some
market, but it's hard to foresee how big, because its size will
depend not on macro trends like the amount people read, but on the
ingenuity of individual publishers. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Some magazines may thrive by focusing on the magazine as a physical
object.  Fashion magazines could be made lush in a way that would
be hard to match digitally, at least for a while.  But this is
probably not an option for most magazines.<br><br>I don't know exactly what the future will look like, but I'm not
too worried about it.  This sort of change tends to create as many
good things as it kills.  Indeed, the really interesting question is not
what will happen to existing forms, but what new forms will appear.<br><br>The reason I've been writing about existing forms is that I don't
<i>know</i> what new forms will appear.  But though I can't predict
specific winners, I can offer a recipe for recognizing them.  When
you see something that's taking advantage of new technology to give
people something they want that they couldn't have before, you're
probably looking at a winner.  And when you see something that's
merely reacting to new technology in an attempt to preserve some
existing source of revenue, you're probably looking at a loser.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I don't like the word "content" and tried for a while to avoid
using it, but I have to admit there's no other word that means the
right thing.  "Information" is too general.<br><br>Ironically, the main reason I don't like "content" is the thesis
of this essay.  The word suggests an undifferentiated slurry, but
economically that's how both publishers and audiences treat it.
Content is information you don't need.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Some types of publishers would be at a disadvantage trying
to enter the software business.  Record labels, for example, would
probably find it more natural to expand into casinos than software,
because the kind of people who run them would be more at home at
the mafia end of the business spectrum than the don't-be-evil end.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
I never watch movies in theaters anymore.  The tipping point
for me was the ads they show first.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Unfortunately, making physically nice books will only be a
niche within a niche.  Publishers are more likely to resort to
expedients like selling autographed copies, or editions with the
buyer's picture on the cover.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Michael Arrington, Trevor Blackwell, Steven Levy, Robert

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><div><div><div></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></div><div><br><br><div><h1 id="discover">Persuade xor Discover </h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">September 2009<br><br>When meeting people you don't know very well, the convention is
to seem extra friendly.  You smile and say "pleased to meet you,"
whether you are or not.  There's nothing dishonest about this.
Everyone knows that these little social lies aren't meant
to be taken literally, just as everyone knows that 
"Can you pass the salt?" is only grammatically a question.<br><br>I'm perfectly willing to smile and say "pleased to meet you"
when meeting new people.  But there is another set of 
customs for being ingratiating in print that are not so
harmless.<br><br>The reason there's a convention of being ingratiating in print
is that most essays are written to persuade.
And as any politician could tell
you, the way to persuade people is not just to baldly state the
facts.  You have to add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine
go down.<br><br>For example, a politician announcing the cancellation of 
a government program will not merely say "The
program is canceled." That would seem offensively
curt.  Instead he'll spend most of his time talking about the
noble effort made by the people who worked on it.<br><br>The reason these conventions are more dangerous is that they
interact with the ideas.  Saying "pleased to meet you" is just
something you prepend to a conversation, but the sort of spin 
added by politicians is woven through it.  We're starting to
move from social lies to real lies.<br><br>Here's an example of a paragraph from an essay I wrote about
<a href="unions.html">labor unions</a>.  As written,
it tends to offend people who like unions.
<blockquote>
  People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic
  union organizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking
  now?  The best they can do is fall back on the default explanation
  of people living in fallen civilizations. Our ancestors were
  giants.  The workers of the early twentieth century must have had
  a moral courage that's lacking today.
</blockquote>
Now here's the same paragraph rewritten to please instead of
offending them:
<blockquote>
  Early union organizers made heroic sacrifices to improve conditions
  for workers.  But though
  labor unions are shrinking now, it's not because present union
  leaders are any less courageous.  An employer couldn't get away
  with hiring thugs to beat up union leaders today, but if they
  did, I see no reason to believe today's union leaders would shrink
  from the challenge.  So I think it would be a mistake to attribute
  the decline of unions to some kind of decline in the people who
  run them.  Early union leaders were heroic, certainly, but we
  should not suppose that if unions have declined, it's because
  present union leaders are somehow inferior.  The cause must be
  external.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
It makes the same point: that it can't have been the personal
qualities of early union organizers that made unions successful,
but must have been some external factor, or otherwise present-day
union leaders would have to be inferior people.  But written this
way it seems like a defense of present-day union organizers rather
than an attack on early ones.  That makes it more persuasive to
people who like unions, because it seems sympathetic to their cause.<br><br>I believe everything I wrote in the second version.  Early union
leaders did make heroic sacrifices.   And
present union leaders probably would rise to the occasion if
necessary.  People tend to; I'm skeptical about the idea of "the
greatest generation." 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>If I believe everything I said in the second version, why didn't I
write it that way?  Why offend people needlessly?<br><br>Because I'd rather offend people than pander to them, 
and if you write about controversial topics you have to choose one or the other.  The degree of
courage of past or present union leaders is beside the point; all
that matters for the argument is that they're the same.
But if you want to please
people who are mistaken, you can't simply tell the truth.  You're
always going to have to add some sort of padding to protect their
misconceptions from bumping against reality.<br><br>Most writers do.  Most writers write to persuade, if only out of
habit or politeness.  But I don't write to persuade; I write to
figure out.  I write to persuade a hypothetical perfectly unbiased
reader.<br><br>Since the custom is to write to persuade the actual reader, someone
who doesn't will seem arrogant.  In fact, worse than arrogant: since
readers are used to essays that try to please someone, an essay
that displeases one side in a dispute reads as an attempt to pander
to the other.  To a lot of pro-union readers, the first paragraph
sounds like the sort of thing a right-wing radio talk show host
would say to stir up his followers.  But it's not.  Something that
curtly contradicts one's beliefs can be hard to distinguish from a
partisan attack on them, but though they can end up in the same
place they come from different sources.<br><br>Would it be so bad to add a few extra words, to make people feel
better?  Maybe not.  Maybe I'm excessively attached to conciseness.
I write <a href="power.html">code</a> the same way I write essays, 
making pass after pass
looking for anything I can cut.  But I have a legitimate reason for
doing this.  You don't know what the ideas are until you get them
down to the fewest words.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The danger of the second paragraph
is not merely that it's longer.  It's that you start to lie to
yourself.  The ideas start to get mixed together with the spin
you've added to get them past the readers' misconceptions.<br><br>I think the goal of an essay should be to discover 
<a href="essay.html">surprising</a> things.  That's my goal, at least.
And most surprising means most different from what people currently
believe.  So writing to persuade and writing to discover are
diametrically opposed.  The more your conclusions disagree with
readers' present beliefs, the more effort you'll have to expend on
selling your ideas rather than having them.  As you accelerate,
this drag increases, till eventually you reach a point where 100%
of your energy is devoted to overcoming it and you can't go any
faster.<br><br>It's hard enough to overcome one's own misconceptions without having
to think about how to get the resulting ideas past other people's.
I worry that if I wrote to persuade, I'd start to shy away unconsciously
from ideas I knew would be hard to sell.  When I notice something
surprising, it's usually very faint at first.  There's nothing more
than a slight stirring of discomfort.  I don't want anything to get
in the way of noticing it consciously.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I had a strange feeling of being back in high school writing
this.  To get a good grade you had to both write the sort of pious
crap you were expected to, but also seem to be writing with conviction.
The solution was a kind of method acting.  It was revoltingly
familiar to slip back into it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Exercise for the reader:
rephrase that thought to please the same people the first version
would offend.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Come to think of it, there is one way in which I deliberately
pander to readers, because it doesn't change the number of words:
I switch person.  This flattering distinction seems so natural to
the average reader that they probably don't notice even when I
switch in mid-sentence, though you tend to notice when it's done
as conspicuously as this.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston and Robert Morris

<p>
October 2009<br><br><i>(This  essay is derived from a talk at the 2009 Startup School.)</i><br><br>I wasn't sure what to talk about at Startup School, so I decided
to ask the founders of the startups we'd funded.  What hadn't I
written about yet?<br><br>I'm in the unusual position of being able to test the essays I write
about startups.  I hope the ones on other topics are right, but I
have no way to test them.  The ones on startups get tested by about
70 people every 6 months.<br><br>So I sent all the founders an email asking what surprised them about
starting a startup.  This amounts to asking what I got wrong, because
if I'd explained things well enough, nothing should have surprised
them.<br><br>I'm proud to report I got one response saying:
</p><blockquote>
    What surprised me the most is that everything was actually
    fairly predictable!
</blockquote>
The bad news is that I got over 100 other responses listing the
surprises they encountered.<br><br>There were very clear patterns in the responses; it was remarkable
how often several people had been surprised by exactly the same
thing.  These were the biggest:<br><br>
<b>1. Be Careful with Cofounders</b><br><br>This was the surprise mentioned by the most founders.  There were
two types of responses: that you have to be careful who you pick
as a cofounder, and that you have to work hard to maintain your
relationship.<br><br>What people wished they'd paid more attention to when choosing
cofounders was character and commitment, not ability.  This was
particularly true with startups that failed.  The lesson: don't
pick cofounders who will flake.<br><br>Here's a typical reponse:
<blockquote>
    You haven't seen someone's true colors unless you've worked
    with them on a startup.
</blockquote>
The reason character is so important is that it's tested more
severely than in most other situations.  One founder said explicitly
that the relationship between founders was more important than
ability:
<blockquote>
    I would rather cofound a startup with a friend than a stranger
    with higher output.  Startups are so hard and emotional that
    the bonds and emotional and social support that come with
    friendship outweigh the extra output lost.
</blockquote>
We learned this lesson a long time ago.  If you look at the YC
application, there are more questions about the commitment and
relationship of the founders than their ability.<br><br>Founders of successful startups talked less about choosing cofounders
and more about how hard they worked to maintain their relationship.
<blockquote>
    One thing that surprised me is how the relationship of startup
    founders goes from a friendship to a marriage.  My relationship
    with my cofounder went from just being friends to seeing each
    other all the time, fretting over the finances and cleaning up
    shit. And the startup was our baby.  I summed it up once like
    this: "It's like we're married, but we're not fucking."
</blockquote>
Several people used that word "married."  It's a far more intense
relationship than you usually see between coworkers—partly because
the stresses are so much greater, and partly because at first the
founders are the whole company.  So this relationship has to be
built of top quality materials and carefully maintained.  It's the
basis of everything.<br><br>
<b>2. Startups Take Over Your Life</b><br><br>Just as the relationship between cofounders is more intense than
it usually is between coworkers, so is the relationship between the
founders and the company.  Running a startup is not like having a
job or being a student, because it never stops.  This is so foreign
to most people's experience that they don't get it till it happens.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
<blockquote>
    I didn't realize I would spend almost every waking moment either
    working or thinking about our startup.  You enter a whole
    different way of life when it's your company vs. working for
    someone else's company.
</blockquote>
It's exacerbated by the fast pace of startups, which makes it seem
like time slows down:
<blockquote>
    I think the thing that's been most surprising to me is how one's
    perspective on time shifts. Working on our startup, I remember
    time seeming to stretch out, so that a month was a huge interval.
</blockquote>
In the best case, total immersion can be exciting:
<blockquote>
    It's surprising how much you become consumed by your startup,
    in that you think about it day and night, but never once does
    it feel like "work."
</blockquote>
Though I have to say, that quote is from someone we funded this
summer.  In a couple years he may not sound so chipper.<br><br>
<b>3. It's an Emotional Roller-coaster</b><br><br>This was another one lots of people were surprised about.  The ups
and downs were more extreme than they were prepared for.<br><br>In a startup, things seem great one moment and hopeless the next.
And by next, I mean a couple hours later.
<blockquote>
    The emotional ups and downs were the biggest surprise for me.
    One day, we'd think of ourselves as the next Google and dream
    of buying islands; the next, we'd be pondering how to let our
    loved ones know of our utter failure; and on and on.
</blockquote>
The hard part, obviously, is the lows.  For a lot of founders that
was the big surprise:
<blockquote>
    How hard it is to keep everyone motivated during rough days or
    weeks, i.e. how low the lows can be.
</blockquote>
After a while, if you don't have significant success to cheer you
up, it wears you out:
<blockquote>
    Your most basic advice to founders is "just don't die," but the
    energy to keep a company going in lieu of unburdening success
    isn't free; it is siphoned from the founders themselves.
</blockquote>
There's a limit to how much you can take.  If you get to the point
where you can't keep working anymore, it's not the end of the world.
Plenty of famous founders have had some failures along the way.<br><br>
<b>4. It Can Be Fun</b><br><br>The good news is, the highs are also very high.  Several founders
said what surprised them most about doing a startup was how fun it
was:
<blockquote>
    I think you've left out just how fun it is to do a startup. I
    am more fulfilled in my work than pretty much any of my friends
    who did not start companies.
</blockquote>
What they like most is the freedom:
<blockquote>
    I'm surprised by how much better it feels to be working on
    something that is challenging and creative, something I believe
    in, as opposed to the hired-gun stuff I was doing before.  I
    knew it would feel better; what's surprising is how much better.
</blockquote>
Frankly, though, if I've misled people here, I'm not eager to fix
that.  I'd rather have everyone think starting a startup is grim
and hard than have founders go into it expecting it to be fun, and
a few months later saying "This is supposed to be <i>fun</i>? Are you
kidding?"<br><br>The truth is, it wouldn't be fun for most people.  A lot of what
we try to do in the application process is to weed out the people
who wouldn't like it, both for our sake and theirs.<br><br>The best way to put it might be that starting a startup is fun the
way a survivalist training course would be fun, if you're into that
sort of thing.  Which is to say, not at all, if you're not.<br><br>
<b>5. Persistence Is the Key</b><br><br>A lot of founders were surprised how important persistence was in
startups. It was both a negative and a positive surprise: they were
surprised both by the degree of persistence required
<blockquote>
    Everyone said how determined and resilient you must be, but
    going through it made me realize that the determination required
    was still understated.
</blockquote>
and also by the degree to which persistence alone was able to
dissolve obstacles:
<blockquote>
    If you are persistent, even problems that seem out of your
    control (i.e. immigration) seem to work themselves out.
</blockquote>
Several founders mentioned specifically how much more important
persistence was than intelligence.
<blockquote>
    I've been surprised again and again by just how much more
    important persistence is than raw intelligence.
</blockquote>
This applies not just to intelligence but to ability in general,
and that's why so many people said character was more important in
choosing cofounders.<br><br>
<b>6. Think Long-Term</b><br><br>You need persistence because everything takes longer than you expect.
A lot of people were surprised by that.
<blockquote>
    I'm continually surprised by how long everything can take.
    Assuming your product doesn't experience the explosive growth
    that very few products do, everything from development to
    dealmaking (especially dealmaking) seems to take 2-3x longer
    than I always imagine.
</blockquote>
One reason founders are surprised is that because they work fast,
they expect everyone else to.   There's a shocking amount of shear
stress at every point where a startup touches a more bureaucratic
organization, like a big company or a VC fund.  That's why fundraising
and the enterprise market kill and maim so many startups.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>But I think the reason most founders are surprised by how long it
takes is that they're overconfident.  They think they're going to
be an instant success, like YouTube or Facebook.  You tell them
only 1 out of 100 successful startups has a trajectory like that,
and they all think "we're going to be that 1."<br><br>Maybe they'll listen to one of the more successful founders:
<blockquote>
    The top thing I didn't understand before going into it is that
    persistence is the name of the game. For the vast majority of
    startups that become successful, it's going to be a <i>really</i>
    long journey, at least 3 years and probably 5+.
</blockquote>
There is a positive side to thinking longer-term.  It's not just
that you have to resign yourself to everything taking longer than
it should.  If you work patiently it's less stressful, and you can
do better work:
<blockquote>
    Because we're relaxed, it's so much easier to have fun doing
    what we do. Gone is the awkward nervous energy fueled by the
    desperate need to not fail guiding our actions. We can concentrate
    on doing what's best for our company, product, employees and
    customers.
</blockquote>
That's why things get so much better when you hit ramen profitability.
You can shift into a different mode of working.<br><br><b>7. Lots of Little Things</b><br><br>We often emphasize how rarely startups win simply because they hit
on some magic idea.  I think founders have now gotten that into
their heads.  But a lot were surprised to find this also applies
within startups.  You have to do lots of different things:
<blockquote>
    It's much more of a grind than glamorous. A timeslice selected
    at random would more likely find me tracking down a weird DLL
    loading bug on Swedish Windows, or tracking down a bug in the
    financial model Excel spreadsheet the night before a board
    meeting, rather than having brilliant flashes of strategic
    insight.
</blockquote>
Most hacker-founders would like to spend all their time programming.
You won't get to, unless you fail.  Which can be transformed into:
If you spend all your time programming, you will fail.<br><br>The principle extends even into programming.  There is rarely a
single brilliant hack that ensures success:
<blockquote>
    I learnt never to bet on any one feature or deal or anything
    to bring you success. It is never a single thing.  Everything
    is just incremental and you just have to keep doing lots of
    those things until you strike something.
</blockquote>
Even in the rare cases where a clever hack makes your fortune, you
probably won't know till later:
<blockquote>
    There is no such thing as a killer feature. Or at least you
    won't know what it is.
</blockquote>
So the best strategy is to try lots of different things.  The reason
not to put all your eggs in one basket is not the usual one,
which applies even when you know which basket is best.  In a startup
you don't even know that.<br><br>
<b>8. Start with Something Minimal</b><br><br>Lots of founders mentioned how important it was to launch with the
simplest possible thing.  By this point everyone knows you should
release fast and iterate.  It's practically a mantra at YC.  But
even so a lot of people seem to have been burned by not doing it:
<blockquote>
    Build the absolute smallest thing that can be considered a
    complete application and ship it.
</blockquote>
Why do people take too long on the first version?  Pride, mostly.
They hate to release something that could be better.  They worry
what people will say about them.  But you have to overcome this:
<blockquote>
    Doing something "simple" at first glance does not mean you
    aren't doing something meaningful, defensible, or valuable.
</blockquote>
Don't worry what people will say.  If your first version is so
impressive that trolls don't make fun of it, you waited too long
to launch.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>One founder said this should be your approach to all programming,
not just startups, and I tend to agree.
<blockquote>
    Now, when coding, I try to think "How can I write this such
    that if people saw my code, they'd be amazed at how little there
    is and how little it does?"
</blockquote>
Over-engineering is poison.  It's not like doing extra work for
extra credit.  It's more like telling a lie that you then have to
remember so you don't contradict it.<br><br>
<b>9. Engage Users</b><br><br>Product development is a conversation with the user that doesn't
really start till you launch.  Before you launch, you're like a
police artist before he's shown the first version of his sketch to
the witness.<br><br>It's so important to launch fast that it may be better to think of
your initial version not as a product, but as a trick for getting
users to start talking to you.
<blockquote>
    I learned to think about the initial stages of a startup as a
    giant experiment. All products should be considered experiments,
    and those that have a market show promising results extremely
    quickly.
</blockquote>
Once you start talking to users, I guarantee you'll be surprised
by what they tell you.
<blockquote>
    When you let customers tell you what they're after, they will
    often reveal amazing details about what they find valuable as
    well what they're willing to pay for.
</blockquote>
The surprise is generally positive as well as negative. They won't
like what you've built, but there will be other things they would
like that would be trivially easy to implement.  It's not till you
start the conversation by launching the wrong thing that they can
express (or perhaps even realize) what they're looking for.<br><br>
<b>10. Change Your Idea</b><br><br>To benefit from engaging with users you have to be willing to change
your idea.  We've always encouraged founders to see a startup idea
as a hypothesis rather than a blueprint.  And yet they're still
surprised how well it works to change the idea.
<blockquote>
    Normally if you complain about something being hard, the general
    advice is to work harder.  With a startup, I think you should
    find a problem that's easy for you to solve.  Optimizing in
    solution-space is familiar and straightforward, but you can
    make enormous gains playing around in problem-space.
</blockquote>
Whereas mere determination, without flexibility, is a greedy algorithm
that may get you nothing more than a mediocre local maximum:
<blockquote>
    When someone is determined, there's still a danger that they'll
    follow a long, hard path that ultimately leads nowhere.
</blockquote>
You want to push forward, but at the same time twist and turn to
find the most promising path.  One founder put it very succinctly:
<blockquote>
    Fast iteration is the key to success.
</blockquote>
One reason this advice is so hard to follow is that people don't
realize how hard it is to judge startup ideas, particularly their
own.  Experienced founders learn to keep an open mind:
<blockquote>
    Now I don't laugh at ideas anymore, because I realized how
    terrible I was at knowing if they were good or not.
</blockquote>
You can never tell what will work.  You just have to do whatever
seems best at each point.  We do this with YC itself.  We still
don't know if it will work, but it seems like a decent hypothesis.<br><br>
<b>11. Don't Worry about Competitors</b><br><br>When you think you've got a great idea, it's sort of like having a
guilty conscience about something.  All someone has to do is look
at you funny, and you think "Oh my God, <i>they know.</i>"<br><br>These alarms are almost always false:
<blockquote>
    Companies that seemed like competitors and threats at first
    glance usually never were when you really looked at it. Even
    if they were operating in the same area, they had a different
    goal.
</blockquote>
One reason people overreact to competitors is that they overvalue
ideas.  If ideas really were the key, a competitor with the same
idea would be a real threat.  But it's usually execution that
matters:
<blockquote>
    All the scares induced by seeing a new competitor pop up are
    forgotten weeks later. It always comes down to your own product
    and approach to the market.
</blockquote>
This is generally true even if competitors get lots of attention.
<blockquote>
    Competitors riding on lots of good blogger perception aren't
    really the winners and can disappear from the map quickly.  You
    need consumers after all.
</blockquote>
Hype doesn't make satisfied users, at least not for something as
complicated as technology.<br><br><b>12. It's Hard to Get Users</b><br><br>A lot of founders complained about how hard it was to get users,
though.
<blockquote>
    I had no idea how much time and effort needed to go into attaining
    users.
</blockquote>
This is a complicated topic.  When you can't get users, it's hard
to say whether the problem is lack of exposure, or whether the
product's simply bad.  Even good products can be blocked by switching
or integration costs:
<blockquote>
    Getting people to use a new service is incredibly difficult.
    This is especially true for a service that other companies can
    use, because it requires their developers to do work. If you're
    small, they don't think it is urgent. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
The sharpest criticism of YC came from a founder who said we didn't
focus enough on customer acquisition:
<blockquote>
    YC preaches "make something people want" as an engineering task,
    a never ending stream of feature after feature until enough
    people are happy and the application takes off.  There's very
    little focus on the cost of customer acquisition.
</blockquote>
This may be true; this may be something we need to fix, especially
for applications like games.  If you make something where the
challenges are mostly technical, you can rely on word of mouth,
like Google did.  One founder was surprised by how well that worked
for him:
<blockquote>
    There is an irrational fear that no one will buy your product.
    But if you work hard and incrementally make it better, there
    is no need to worry.
</blockquote>
But with other types of startups you may win less by features and
more by deals and marketing.<br><br>
<b>13. Expect the Worst with Deals</b><br><br>Deals fall through.  That's a constant of the startup world.  Startups
are powerless, and good startup ideas generally seem wrong.  So
everyone is nervous about closing deals with you, and you have no
way to make them.<br><br>This is particularly true with investors:
<blockquote>
    In retrospect, it would have been much better if we had operated
    under the assumption that we would never get any additional
    outside investment.  That would have focused us on finding
    revenue streams early.
</blockquote>
My advice is generally pessimistic.  Assume you won't get money,
and if someone does offer you any, assume you'll never get any more.
<blockquote>
    If someone offers you money, take it. You say it a lot, but I
    think it needs even more emphasizing.  We had the opportunity
    to raise a lot more money than we did last year and I wish we
    had.
</blockquote>
Why do founders ignore me?  Mostly because they're optimistic by
nature.  The mistake is to be optimistic about things you can't
control. By all means be optimistic about your ability to make
something great.  But you're asking for trouble if you're optimistic
about big companies or investors.<br><br>
<b>14. Investors Are Clueless</b><br><br>A lot of founders mentioned how surprised they were by the cluelessness
of investors:
<blockquote>
    They don't even know about the stuff they've invested in.  I
    met some investors that had invested in a hardware device and
    when I asked them to demo the device they had difficulty switching
    it on.
</blockquote>
Angels are a bit better than VCs, because they usually have startup
experience themselves:
<blockquote>
    VC investors don't know half the time what they are talking
    about and are years behind in their thinking.  A few were great,
    but 95% of the investors we dealt with were unprofessional,
    didn't seem to be very good at business or have any kind of
    creative vision. Angels were generally much better to talk to.
</blockquote>
Why are founders surprised that VCs are clueless?  I think it's
because they seem so formidable.<br><br>The reason VCs seem formidable is that it's their profession to.
You get to be a VC by convincing asset managers to trust you with
hundreds of millions of dollars.  How do you do that?  You have to
seem confident, and you have to seem like you understand technology.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>15. You May Have to Play Games</b><br><br>Because investors are so bad at judging you, you have to work harder
than you should at selling yourself. One founder said the thing
that surprised him most was
<blockquote>
    The degree to which feigning certitude impressed investors.
</blockquote>
This is the thing that has surprised <i>me</i> most about YC founders'
experiences.  This summer we invited some of the alumni to talk to
the new startups about fundraising, and pretty much 100% of their
advice was about investor psychology.  I thought I was cynical about
VCs, but the founders were much more cynical.
<blockquote>
    A lot of what startup founders do is just posturing.  It works.
</blockquote>
VCs themselves have no idea of the extent to which the startups
they like are the ones that are best at selling themselves to VCs.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font>
It's exactly the same phenomenon we saw a step earlier.  VCs get
money by seeming confident to LPs, and founders get money by seeming
confident to VCs.<br><br>
<b>16. Luck Is a Big Factor</b><br><br>With two such random linkages in the path between startups and
money, it shouldn't be surprising that luck is a big factor in
deals.  And yet a lot of founders are surprised by it.
<blockquote>
    I didn't realize how much of a role luck plays and how much is
    outside of our control.
</blockquote>
If you think about famous startups, it's pretty clear how big a
role luck plays.  Where would Microsoft be if IBM insisted on an
exclusive license for DOS?<br><br>Why are founders fooled by this?  Business guys probably aren't,
but hackers are used to a world where skill is paramount, and you
get what you deserve.
<blockquote>
    When we started our startup, I had bought the hype of the startup
    founder dream: that this is a game of skill. It is, in some
    ways.  Having skill is valuable. So is being determined as all
    hell. But being lucky is the critical ingredient.
</blockquote>
Actually the best model would be to say that the outcome is the
<i>product</i> of skill, determination, and luck.  No matter how much
skill and determination you have, if you roll a zero for luck, the
outcome is zero.<br><br>These quotes about luck are not from founders whose startups failed.
Founders who fail quickly tend to blame themselves.  Founders who
succeed quickly don't usually realize how lucky they were.  It's
the ones in the middle who see how important luck is.<br><br>
<b>17. The Value of Community</b><br><br>A surprising number of founders said what surprised them most about
starting a startup was the value of community.  Some meant the
micro-community of YC founders:
<blockquote>
    The immense value of the peer group of YC companies, and facing
    similar obstacles at similar times.
</blockquote>
which shouldn't be that surprising, because that's why it's structured
that way.  Others were surprised at the value of the startup community
in the larger sense:
<blockquote>
    How advantageous it is to live in Silicon Valley, where you
    can't help but hear all the cutting-edge tech and startup news,
    and run into useful people constantly.
</blockquote>
The specific thing that surprised them most was the general spirit
of benevolence:
<blockquote>
    One of the most surprising things I saw was the willingness of
    people to help us. Even people who had nothing to gain went out
    of their way to help our startup succeed.
</blockquote>
and particularly how it extended all the way to the top:
<blockquote>
    The surprise for me was how accessible important and interesting
    people are. It's amazing how easily you can reach out to people
    and get immediate feedback.
</blockquote>
This is one of the reasons I like being part of this world.  Creating
wealth is not a zero-sum game, so you don't have to stab people in
the back to win.<br><br>
<b>18. You Get No Respect</b><br><br>There was one surprise founders mentioned that I'd forgotten about:
that outside the startup world, startup founders get no respect.
<blockquote>
    In social settings, I found that I got a lot more respect when
    I said, "I worked on Microsoft Office" instead of "I work at a
    small startup you've never heard of called x."
</blockquote>
Partly this is because the rest of the world just doesn't get
startups, and partly it's yet another consequence of the fact that
most good startup ideas seem bad:
<blockquote>
    If you pitch your idea to a random person, 95% of the time
    you'll find the person instinctively thinks the idea will be a
    flop and you're wasting your time (although they probably won't
    say this directly).
</blockquote>
Unfortunately this extends even to dating:
<blockquote>
    It surprised me that being a startup founder does not get you
    more admiration from women.
</blockquote>
I did know about that, but I'd forgotten.<br><br>
<b>19. Things Change as You Grow</b><br><br>The last big surprise founders mentioned is how much things changed
as they grew.  The biggest change was that you got to program even
less:
<blockquote>
    Your job description as technical founder/CEO is completely
    rewritten every 6-12 months. Less coding, more
    managing/planning/company building, hiring, cleaning up messes,
    and generally getting things in place for what needs to happen
    a few months from now.
</blockquote>
In particular, you now have to deal with employees, who often have
different motivations:
<blockquote>
    I knew the founder equation and had been focused on it since I
    knew I wanted to start a startup as a 19 year old.  The employee
    equation is quite different so it took me a while to get it
    down.
</blockquote>
Fortunately, it can become a lot less stressful once you reach
cruising altitude:
<blockquote>
    I'd say 75% of the stress is gone now from when we first started.
    Running a business is so much more enjoyable now.  We're more
    confident. We're more patient. We fight less. We sleep more.
</blockquote>
I wish I could say it was this way for every startup that succeeded,
but 75% is probably on the high side.<br><br>
<b>The Super-Pattern</b><br><br>There were a few other patterns, but these were the biggest.  One's
first thought when looking at them all is to ask if there's a
super-pattern, a pattern to the patterns.<br><br>I saw it immediately, and so did a YC founder I read the list to.
These are supposed to be the surprises, the things I didn't tell
people.  What do they all have in common?  They're all things I
tell people.  If I wrote a new essay with the same outline as this
that wasn't summarizing the founders' responses, everyone would say
I'd run out of ideas and was just repeating myself.<br><br>What is going on here?<br><br>When I look at the responses, the common theme is that
starting a startup was like I said, but way more so.  People just
don't seem to get how different it is till they do it.  Why?  The
key to that mystery is to ask, how different <i>from what?</i>  Once you
phrase it that way, the answer is obvious: from a job.  Everyone's
model of work is a job.  It's completely pervasive.  Even if you've
never had a job, your parents probably did, along with practically
every other adult you've met.<br><br>Unconsciously, everyone expects a startup to be like a job, and
that explains most of the surprises.  It explains why people are
surprised how carefully you have to choose cofounders and how hard
you have to work to maintain your relationship.  You don't have to
do that with coworkers.  It explains why the ups and downs are
surprisingly extreme.  In a job there is much more damping.  But
it also explains why the good times are surprisingly good: most
people can't imagine such freedom.  As you go down the list, almost
all the surprises are surprising in how much a startup differs from
a job.<br><br>You probably can't overcome anything so pervasive as the model of
work you grew up with.  So the best solution is to be consciously
aware of that.  As you go into a startup, you'll be thinking "everyone
says it's really extreme."  Your next thought will probably be "but
I can't believe it will be that bad."  If you want to avoid being
surprised, the next thought after that should be: "and the reason
I can't believe it will be that bad is that my model of work is a
job."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The best way for a startup to engage with slow-moving

<p>
November 2009<br><br>I don't think Apple realizes how badly the App Store approval process
is broken.  Or rather, I don't think they realize how much it matters
that it's broken.<br><br>The way Apple runs the App Store has harmed their reputation with
programmers more than anything else they've ever done. 
Their reputation with programmers used to be great.
It used to be the most common complaint you heard
about Apple was that their fans admired them too uncritically.
The App Store has changed that.  Now a lot of programmers
have started to see Apple as evil.<br><br>How much of the goodwill Apple once had with programmers have they
lost over the App Store?  A third?  Half?  And that's just so far.
The App Store is an ongoing karma leak.<br><br></p><center>* * *</center><br><br>How did Apple get into this mess?  Their fundamental problem is
that they don't understand software.<br><br>They treat iPhone apps the way they treat the music they sell through
iTunes.  Apple is the channel; they own the user; if you want to
reach users, you do it on their terms. The record labels agreed,
reluctantly.  But this model doesn't work for software.  It doesn't
work for an intermediary to own the user.  The software business
learned that in the early 1980s, when companies like VisiCorp showed
that although the words "software" and "publisher" fit together,
the underlying concepts don't.  Software isn't like music or books.
It's too complicated for a third party to act as an intermediary
between developer and user.   And yet that's what Apple is trying
to be with the App Store: a software publisher.  And a particularly
overreaching one at that, with fussy tastes and a rigidly enforced
house style.<br><br>If software publishing didn't work in 1980, it works even less now
that software development has evolved from a small number of big
releases to a constant stream of small ones.  But Apple doesn't
understand that either.  Their model of product development derives
from hardware.  They work on something till they think it's finished,
then they release it.  You have to do that with hardware, but because
software is so easy to change, its design can benefit from evolution.
The standard way to develop applications now is to launch fast and
iterate.  Which means it's a disaster to have long, random delays
each time you release a new version.<br><br>Apparently Apple's attitude is that developers should be more careful
when they submit a new version to the App Store.  They would say
that.  But powerful as they are, they're not powerful enough to
turn back the evolution of technology.  Programmers don't use
launch-fast-and-iterate out of laziness.  They use it because it
yields the best results.  By obstructing that process, Apple is
making them do bad work, and programmers hate that as much as Apple
would.<br><br>How would Apple like it if when they discovered a serious bug in
OS&nbsp;X, instead of releasing a software update immediately, they had
to submit their code to an intermediary who sat on it for a month
and then rejected it because it contained an icon they didn't like?<br><br>By breaking software development, Apple gets the opposite of what
they intended: the version of an app currently available in the App
Store tends to be an old and buggy one.  One developer told me:
<blockquote>
  As a result of their process, the App Store is full of half-baked
  applications. I make a new version almost every day that I release
  to beta users. The version on the App Store feels old and crappy.
  I'm sure that a lot of developers feel this way: One emotion is
  "I'm not really proud about what's in the App Store", and it's
  combined with the emotion "Really, it's Apple's fault."
</blockquote>
Another wrote:
<blockquote>
  I believe that they think their approval process helps users by
  ensuring quality.  In reality, bugs like ours get through all the
  time and then it can take 4-8 weeks to get that bug fix approved,
  leaving users to think that iPhone apps sometimes just don't work.
  Worse for Apple, these apps work just fine on other platforms
  that have immediate approval processes.
</blockquote>
Actually I suppose Apple has a third misconception: that all the
complaints about App Store approvals are not a serious problem.
They must hear developers complaining.  But partners and suppliers
are always complaining.  It would be a bad sign if they weren't;
it would mean you were being too easy on them.  Meanwhile the iPhone
is selling better than ever.  So why do they need to fix anything?<br><br>They get away with maltreating developers, in the short term, because
they make such great hardware.  I just bought a new 27" iMac a
couple days ago.  It's fabulous.  The screen's too shiny, and the
disk is surprisingly loud, but it's so beautiful that you can't
make yourself care.<br><br>So I bought it, but I bought it, for the first time, with misgivings.
I felt the way I'd feel buying something made in a country with a
bad human rights record.  That was new.  In the past when I bought
things from Apple it was an unalloyed pleasure.  Oh boy!  They make
such great stuff.  This time it felt like a Faustian bargain.  They
make such great stuff, but they're such assholes.  Do I really want
to support this company?<br><br><center>* * *</center><br><br>Should Apple care what people like me think?  What difference does
it make if they alienate a small minority of their users?<br><br>There are a couple reasons they should care.  One is that these
users are the people they want as employees.  If your company seems
evil, the best programmers won't work for you.  That hurt Microsoft
a lot starting in the 90s.  Programmers started to feel sheepish
about working there.  It seemed like selling out.  When people from
Microsoft were talking to other programmers and they mentioned where
they worked, there were a lot of self-deprecating jokes about having
gone over to the dark side.  But the real problem for Microsoft
wasn't the embarrassment of the people they hired.  It was the
people they never got.  And you know who got them?  Google and
Apple.  If Microsoft was the Empire, they were the Rebel Alliance.
And it's largely because they got more of the best people that
Google and Apple are doing so much better than Microsoft today.<br><br>Why are programmers so fussy about their employers' morals?  Partly
because they can afford to be.  The best programmers can work
wherever they want.  They don't have to work for a company they
have qualms about.<br><br>But the other reason programmers are fussy, I think, is that evil
begets stupidity.  An organization that wins by exercising power
starts to lose the ability to win by doing better work.  And it's
not fun for a smart person to work in a place where the best ideas
aren't the ones that win.  I think the reason Google embraced "Don't
be evil" so eagerly was not so much to impress the outside world
as to inoculate themselves against arrogance.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>That has worked for Google so far.  They've become more
bureaucratic, but otherwise they seem to have held true to their
original principles. With Apple that seems less the case.  When you
look at the famous 
<a href="http://www.uriahcarpenter.info/1984.html">1984 ad</a> 
now, it's easier to imagine Apple as the
dictator on the screen than the woman with the hammer.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
In fact, if you read the dictator's speech it sounds uncannily like a
prophecy of the App Store.
<blockquote>
  We have triumphed over the unprincipled dissemination of facts.<br><br>We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of
  pure ideology, where each worker may bloom secure from the pests
  of contradictory and confusing truths.
</blockquote>
The other reason Apple should care what programmers think of them
is that when you sell a platform, developers make or break you.  If
anyone should know this, Apple should.  VisiCalc made the Apple II.<br><br>And programmers build applications for the platforms they use.  Most
applications—most startups, probably—grow out of personal projects.
Apple itself did.  Apple made microcomputers because that's what
Steve Wozniak wanted for himself.  He couldn't have afforded a
minicomputer. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
 Microsoft likewise started out making interpreters
for little microcomputers because
Bill Gates and Paul Allen were interested in using them.  It's a
rare startup that doesn't build something the founders use.<br><br>The main reason there are so many iPhone apps is that so many programmers
have iPhones.  They may know, because they read it in an article,
that Blackberry has such and such market share.  But in practice
it's as if RIM didn't exist. If they're going to build something,
they want to be able to use it themselves, and that means building
an iPhone app.<br><br>So programmers continue to develop iPhone apps, even though Apple
continues to maltreat them.  They're like someone stuck in an abusive
relationship.  They're so attracted to the iPhone that they can't
leave.  But they're looking for a way out.  One wrote:
<blockquote>
  While I did enjoy developing for the iPhone, the control they
  place on the App Store does not give me the drive to develop
  applications as I would like. In fact I don't intend to make any
  more iPhone applications unless absolutely necessary.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
Can anything break this cycle?  No device I've seen so far could.
Palm and RIM haven't a hope.  The only credible contender is Android.
But Android is an orphan; Google doesn't really care about it, not
the way Apple cares about the iPhone.  Apple cares about the iPhone
the way Google cares about search.<br><br><center>* * *</center><br><br>Is the future of handheld devices one locked down by Apple?  It's
a worrying prospect.  It would be a bummer to have another grim
monoculture like we had in the 1990s.  In 1995, writing software
for end users was effectively identical with writing Windows
applications.  Our horror at that prospect was the single biggest
thing that drove us to start building <a href="road.html">web apps</a>.<br><br>At least we know now what it would take to break Apple's lock.
You'd have to get iPhones out of programmers' hands.  If programmers
used some other device for mobile web access, they'd start to develop
apps for that instead.<br><br>How could you make a device programmers liked better than the iPhone?
It's unlikely you could make something better designed.  Apple
leaves no room there.  So this alternative device probably couldn't
win on general appeal.  It would have to win by virtue of some
appeal it had to programmers specifically.<br><br>One way to appeal to programmers is with software.  If you
could think of an application programmers had to have, but that
would be impossible in the circumscribed world of the iPhone, 
you could presumably get them to switch.<br><br>That would definitely happen if programmers started to use handhelds
as development machines—if handhelds displaced laptops the
way laptops displaced desktops.  You need more control of a development
machine than Apple will let you have over an iPhone.<br><br>Could anyone make a device that you'd carry around in your pocket
like a phone, and yet would also work as a development machine?
It's hard to imagine what it would look like.  But I've learned
never to say never about technology.  A phone-sized device that
would work as a development machine is no more miraculous by present
standards than the iPhone itself would have seemed by the standards
of 1995.<br><br>My current development machine is a MacBook Air, which I use with
an external monitor and keyboard in my office, and by itself when
traveling.  If there was a version half the size I'd prefer it.
That still wouldn't be small enough to carry around everywhere like
a phone, but we're within a factor of 4 or so.  Surely that gap is
bridgeable.  In fact, let's make it an
<a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs5.html">RFS</a>. Wanted: 
Woman with hammer.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
When Google adopted "Don't be evil," they were still so small
that no one would have expected them to be, yet.<br><br>
[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
The dictator in the 1984 ad isn't Microsoft, incidentally;
it's IBM.  IBM seemed a lot more frightening in those days, but
they were friendlier to developers than Apple is now.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
He couldn't even afford a <i>monitor</i>.  That's why the Apple
I used a TV as a monitor.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Several people I talked to mentioned how much they liked the
iPhone SDK.  The problem is not Apple's products but their policies.
Fortunately policies are software; Apple can change them instantly
if they want to.  Handy that, isn't it?<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Ross Boucher,

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
April 2010<br><br>The best way to come up with startup ideas is to ask yourself the
question: what do you wish someone would make for you?<br><br>There are two types of startup ideas: those that grow organically
out of your own life, and those that you decide, from afar, are
going to be necessary to some class of users other than you.  Apple
was the first type.  Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a
computer.  Unlike most people who wanted computers, he could design
one, so he did.  And since lots of other people wanted the same
thing, Apple was able to sell enough of them to get the company
rolling.  They still rely on this principle today, incidentally.
The iPhone is the phone Steve Jobs wants.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Our own startup, Viaweb, was of the second type.  We made software
for building online stores.  We didn't need this software ourselves.
We weren't direct marketers.  We didn't even know when we started
that our users were called "direct marketers."  But we were
comparatively old when we started the company (I was 30 and Robert
Morris was 29), so we'd seen enough to know users would need this
type of software.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>There is no sharp line between the two types of ideas, but
the most successful startups seem to be closer to the Apple type
than the Viaweb type.  When he was writing that first Basic interpreter
for the Altair, Bill Gates was writing something he would use, as
were Larry and Sergey when they wrote the first versions of Google.<br><br>Organic ideas are generally preferable to the made up kind, but
particularly so when the founders are young.  It takes experience
to predict what other people will want.  The worst ideas we see at
Y Combinator are from young founders making things they think other
people will want.<br><br>So if you want to start a startup and don't know yet what you're
going to do, I'd encourage you to focus initially on organic ideas.
What's missing or broken in your daily life?  Sometimes if you just
ask that question you'll get immediate answers.  It must have seemed
obviously broken to Bill Gates that you could only program the
Altair in machine language.<br><br>You may need to stand outside yourself a bit to see brokenness,
because you tend to get used to it and take it for granted.  You
can be sure it's there, though.  There are always great ideas sitting
right under our noses.  In 2004 it was ridiculous that Harvard
undergrads were still using a Facebook printed on paper.  Surely
that sort of thing should have been online.<br><br>There are ideas that obvious lying around now.  The reason you're
overlooking them is the same reason you'd have overlooked the idea
of building Facebook in 2004: organic startup ideas usually don't
seem like startup ideas at first.  We know now that Facebook was
very successful, but put yourself back in 2004.  Putting undergraduates'
profiles online wouldn't have seemed like much of a startup idea.
And in fact, it wasn't initially a startup idea.  When Mark spoke
at a YC dinner this winter he said he wasn't trying to start a
company when he wrote the first version of Facebook.  It was just
a project.  So was the Apple I when Woz first started working on
it.  He didn't think he was starting a company.  If these guys had
thought they were starting companies, they might have been tempted
to do something more "serious," and that would have been a mistake.<br><br>So if you want to come up with organic startup ideas, I'd encourage
you to focus more on the idea part and less on the startup part.
Just fix things that seem broken, regardless of whether it seems
like the problem is important enough to build a company on.  If you
keep pursuing such threads it would be hard not to end up making
something of value to a lot of people, and when you do, surprise,
you've got a company.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Don't be discouraged if what you produce initially is something
other people dismiss as a toy.  In fact, that's a good sign.
That's probably why everyone else has been overlooking the idea.  The first
microcomputers were dismissed as toys.  And the first planes, and
the first cars.  At this point, when someone comes to us with
something that users like but that we could envision forum trolls
dismissing as a toy, it makes us especially likely to invest.<br><br>While young founders are at a disadvantage when coming up with
made-up ideas, they're the best source of organic ones, because
they're at the forefront of technology.  They use the latest stuff.
They only just decided what to use, so why wouldn't they?  And
because they use the latest stuff, they're in a position to discover
valuable types of fixable brokenness first.<br><br>There's nothing more valuable than an unmet need that is just
becoming fixable.  If you find something broken that you can fix
for a lot of people, you've found a gold mine.  As with an actual
gold mine, you still have to work hard to get the gold out of it.
But at least you know where the seam is, and that's the hard part.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This suggests a way to predict areas where Apple will be weak:
things Steve Jobs doesn't use.  E.g. I doubt he is much into gaming.<br><br>
[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In retrospect, we should have <i>become</i> direct marketers.  If
I were doing Viaweb again, I'd open our own online store.  If we
had, we'd have understood users a lot better.  I'd encourage anyone
starting a startup to become one of its users, however unnatural it
seems.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Possible exception: It's hard to compete directly with open source software.
You can build things for programmers, but there has to be some part
you can charge for.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, and Jessica Livingston

I
now had to think about something I hadn't had to think about before:
how not to lose it.   I knew it was possible to go from rich to
poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich.  But while
I'd spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from
<a href="wealth.html">poor to rich</a>, 
I knew practically nothing about the paths from rich
to poor.  Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they
were.<br><br>So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost.  If you'd
asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I'd have said by
spending all their money.  That's how it happens in books and movies,
because that's the colorful way to do it.  But in fact the way most
fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through
bad investments.<br><br>It's hard to spend a fortune without noticing.  Someone with ordinary
tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of
thousands of dollars without thinking "wow, I'm spending a lot of
money."  Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a
million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an
eye.<br><br>In most people's minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms
that making investments doesn't.  Luxuries seem self-indulgent.
And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery,
you've already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads
to trouble.  Investing bypasses those alarms.  You're not spending
the money; you're just moving it from one asset to another.  Which
is why people trying to sell you expensive things say "it's an
investment."<br><br>The solution is to develop new alarms.  This can be a tricky business,
because while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are so
basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you
from making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes
fairly counterintuitive.<br><br>A few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with
time is much the same as with money.  The most dangerous way to
lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake
work.  When you spend time having fun, you know you're being
self-indulgent.  Alarms start to go off fairly quickly.  If I woke
up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I'd
feel like something was terribly wrong.  Just thinking about it
makes me wince.  I'd start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on
a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.<br><br>And yet I've definitely had days when I might as well have sat in
front of a TV all day — days at the end of which, if I asked myself
what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically,
nothing.  I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad
as I'd feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV.  If
I spent a whole day watching TV I'd feel like I was descending into
perdition.  But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get
nothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially,
like real work.  Dealing with email, for example.  You do it sitting
at a desk.  It's not fun.  So it must be work.<br><br>With time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to
protect you.  It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers,
and perhaps all pre-industrial societies.  So nature and nurture
combine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world has gotten
more complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors
that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more
virtuous types.  And the worst thing is, they're not even fun.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>
July 2010<br><br>I realized recently that what one thinks about in the shower in the
morning is more important than I'd thought.  I knew it was a good
time to have ideas.  Now I'd go further: now I'd say it's hard to
do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower.<br><br>Everyone who's worked on difficult problems is probably familiar
with the phenomenon of working hard to figure something out, failing,
and then suddenly seeing the answer a bit later while doing something
else. There's a kind of thinking you do without trying to.  I'm
increasingly convinced this type of thinking is not merely helpful
in solving hard problems, but necessary.  The tricky part is, you
can only control it indirectly.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>I think most people have one top idea in their mind at any given
time.  That's the idea their thoughts will drift toward when they're
allowed to drift freely.  And this idea will thus tend to get all
the benefit of that type of thinking, while others are starved of
it.  Which means it's a disaster to let the wrong idea become the
top one in your mind.<br><br>What made this clear to me was having an idea I didn't want as the
top one in my mind for two long stretches.<br><br>I'd noticed startups got way less done when they started raising
money, but it was not till we ourselves raised money that I understood
why.  The problem is not the actual time it takes to meet with
investors.  The problem is that once you start raising money, raising
money becomes the top idea in your mind.  That becomes what you
think about when you take a shower in the morning.  And that means
other questions aren't.<br><br>I'd hated raising money when I was running Viaweb, but I'd forgotten
why I hated it so much.  When we raised money for Y Combinator, I
remembered.  Money matters are particularly likely to become the
top idea in your mind.  The reason is that they have to be.  It's
hard to get money.  It's not the sort of thing that happens by
default.  It's not going to happen unless you let it become the
thing you think about in the shower.  And then you'll make little
progress on anything else you'd rather be working on.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>(I hear similar complaints from friends who are professors.  Professors
nowadays seem to have become professional fundraisers who do a
little research on the side.  It may be time to fix that.)<br><br>The reason this struck me so forcibly is that for most of the
preceding 10 years I'd been able to think about what I wanted.  So
the contrast when I couldn't was sharp.  But I don't think this
problem is unique to me, because just about every startup I've seen
grinds to a halt when they start raising money � or <a href="corpdev.html"><font color="#000099">talking
to acquirers</font></a>.<br><br>You can't directly control where your thoughts drift.  If you're
controlling them, they're not drifting.  But you can control them
indirectly, by controlling what situations you let yourself get
into.  That has been the lesson for me: be careful what you let
become critical to you.  Try to get yourself into situations where
the most urgent problems are ones you want to think about.<br><br>You don't have complete control, of course.  An emergency could
push other thoughts out of your head.  But barring emergencies you
have a good deal of indirect control over what becomes the top idea
in your mind.<br><br>I've found there are two types of thoughts especially worth
avoiding � thoughts like the Nile Perch in the way they push
out more interesting ideas.  One I've already mentioned: thoughts
about money. Getting money is almost by definition an attention
sink.
The other is disputes.  These too are engaging in the
wrong way: they have the same velcro-like shape as genuinely
interesting ideas, but without the substance.  So avoid disputes
if you want to get real work done.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Even Newton fell into this trap.  After publishing his theory of
colors in 1672 he found himself distracted by disputes for years,
finally concluding that the only solution was to stop publishing:
</p><blockquote>
  I see I have made myself a slave to Philosophy, but if I get free
  of Mr Linus's business I will resolutely bid adew to it eternally,
  excepting what I do for my privat satisfaction or leave to come
  out after me.  For I see a man must either resolve to put out
  nothing new or become a slave to defend it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
Linus and his students at Liege were among the more tenacious
critics.  Newton's biographer Westfall seems to feel he was
overreacting:
<blockquote>
  Recall that at the time he wrote, Newton's "slavery" consisted
  of five replies to Liege, totalling fourteen printed pages, over
  the course of a year.
</blockquote>
I'm more sympathetic to Newton. The problem was not the 14 pages,
but the pain of having this stupid controversy constantly reintroduced
as the top idea in a mind that wanted so eagerly to think about
other things.<br><br>Turning the other cheek turns out to have selfish advantages.
Someone who does you an injury hurts you twice: first by the injury
itself, and second by taking up your time afterward thinking about
it.  If you learn to ignore injuries you can at least avoid the
second half.  I've found I can to some extent avoid thinking about
nasty things people have done to me by telling myself: this doesn't
deserve space in my head.  I'm always delighted to find I've forgotten
the details of disputes, because that means I hadn't been thinking
about them.  My wife thinks I'm more forgiving than she is, but my
motives are purely selfish.<br><br>I suspect a lot of people aren't sure what's the top idea in their
mind at any given time.  I'm often mistaken about it.  I tend to
think it's the idea I'd want to be the top one, rather than the one
that is.  But it's easy to figure this out: just take a shower.
What topic do your thoughts keep returning to?  If it's not what
you want to be thinking about, you may want to change something.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]

This was made particularly clear in our case, because neither
of the funds we raised was difficult, and yet in both cases the
process dragged on for months.  Moving large amounts of money around
is never something people treat casually.  The attention required
increases with the amount—maybe not linearly, but definitely
monotonically.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]

that they're all more concentrated forms of less addictive predecessors.
Most if not all the things we describe as addictive are.  And the
scary thing is, the process that created them is accelerating.<br><br>We wouldn't want to stop it.  It's the same process that cures
diseases: technological progress.  Technological progress means
making things do more of what we want.  When the thing we want is
something we want to want, we consider technological progress good.
If some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, that
seems strictly better.  When progress concentrates something we
don't want to want — when it transforms opium into heroin — it seems
bad.  But it's the same process at work.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>No one doubts this process is accelerating, which means increasing
numbers of things we like will be transformed into things we like
too much.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>As far as I know there's no word for something we like too much.
The closest is the colloquial sense of "addictive." That usage has
become increasingly common during my lifetime. And it's clear why:
there are an increasing number of things we need it for. At the
extreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth. Food has been
transformed by a combination of factory farming and innovations in
food processing into something with way more immediate bang for the
buck, and you can see the results in any town in America. Checkers
and solitaire have been replaced by World of Warcraft and FarmVille.
TV has become much more engaging, and even so it <a href="convergence.html">can't compete</a> with Facebook.<br><br>The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago.   And unless
the forms of technological progress that produced these things are
subject to different laws than technological progress in general,
the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did
in the last 40.<br><br>The next 40 years will bring us some wonderful things.  I don't
mean to imply they're all to be avoided.  Alcohol is a dangerous
drug, but I'd rather live in a world with wine than one without.
Most people can coexist with alcohol; but you have to be careful.
More things we like will mean more things we have to be careful
about.<br><br>Most people won't, unfortunately.  Which means that as the world
becomes more addictive, the two senses in which one can live a
normal life will be driven ever further apart.  One sense of "normal"
is statistically normal: what everyone else does.  The other is the
sense we mean when we talk about the normal operating range of a
piece of machinery: what works best.<br><br>These two senses are already quite far apart.  Already someone
trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of
the US.  That phenomenon is only going to become more pronounced.
You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that if
people don't think you're weird, you're living badly.<br><br>Societies eventually develop antibodies to addictive new things.
I've seen that happen with cigarettes.  When cigarettes first
appeared, they spread the way an infectious disease spreads through
a previously isolated population.  Smoking rapidly became a
(statistically) normal thing.  There were ashtrays everywhere.  We
had ashtrays in our house when I was a kid, even though neither of
my parents smoked.  You had to for guests.<br><br>As knowledge spread about the dangers of smoking, customs changed.
In the last 20 years, smoking has been transformed from something
that seemed totally normal into a rather seedy habit: from something
movie stars did in publicity shots to something small huddles of
addicts do outside the doors of office buildings.  A lot of the
change was due to legislation, of course, but the legislation
couldn't have happened if customs hadn't already changed.<br><br>It took a while though—on the order of 100 years.  And unless the
rate at which social antibodies evolve can increase to match the
accelerating rate at which technological progress throws off new
addictions, we'll be increasingly unable to rely on customs to
protect us.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Unless we want to be canaries in the coal mine
of each new addiction—the people whose sad example becomes a
lesson to future generations—we'll have to figure out for ourselves
what to avoid and how.  It will actually become a reasonable strategy
(or a more reasonable strategy) to suspect 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet">everything new</a>.<br><br>In fact, even that won't be enough.  We'll have to worry not just
about new things, but also about existing things becoming more
addictive.  That's what bit me.  I've avoided most addictions, but
the Internet got me because it became addictive while I was using
it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Most people I know have problems with Internet addiction.  We're
all trying to figure out our own customs for getting free of it.
That's why I don't have an iPhone, for example; the last thing I
want is for the Internet to follow me out into the world.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
My latest trick is taking long hikes.  I used to think running was a
better form of exercise than hiking because it took less time.  Now
the slowness of hiking seems an advantage, because the longer I
spend on the trail, the longer I have to think without interruption.<br><br>Sounds pretty eccentric, doesn't it?  It always will when you're
trying to solve problems where there are no customs yet to guide
you.  Maybe I can't plead Occam's razor; maybe I'm simply eccentric.
But if I'm right about the acceleration of addictiveness, then this
kind of lonely squirming to avoid it will increasingly be the fate
of anyone who wants to get things done.  We'll increasingly be
defined by what we say no to.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Could you restrict technological progress to areas where you
wanted it?  Only in a limited way, without becoming a police state.
And even then your restrictions would have undesirable side effects.
"Good" and "bad" technological progress aren't sharply differentiated,
so you'd find you couldn't slow the latter without also slowing the
former.  And in any case, as Prohibition and the "war on drugs"
show, bans often do more harm than good.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Technology has always been accelerating.  By Paleolithic
standards, technology evolved at a blistering pace in the Neolithic
period.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Unless we mass produce social customs.  I suspect the recent
resurgence of evangelical Christianity in the US is partly a reaction
to drugs.  In desperation people reach for the sledgehammer; if
their kids won't listen to them, maybe they'll listen to God.  But
that solution has broader consequences than just getting kids to
say no to drugs.  You end up saying no to 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbXgsMxOPtI">science</a> as well.
<!-- "A rare look inside a bible belt classroom." --><br><br>I worry we may be heading for a future in which only a few people
plot their own itinerary through no-land, while everyone else books
a package tour.  Or worse still, has one booked for them by the
government.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
People commonly use the word "procrastination" to describe
what they do on the Internet.  It seems to me too mild to describe
what's happening as merely not-doing-work.  We don't call it
procrastination when someone gets drunk instead of working.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Several people have told me they like the iPad because it
lets them bring the Internet into situations where a laptop would
be too conspicuous.  In other words, it's a hip flask.  (This is
true of the iPhone too, of course, but this advantage isn't as
obvious because it reads as a phone, and everyone's used to those.)<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, and

<p>
August 2010<br><br>Two years ago I
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/googles.html#next">wrote</a> about what I called "<xa href="http://www.paulgraham.com/googles.html#next">a huge, unexploited
opportunity in startup funding:" the growing disconnect between
VCs, whose current business model requires them to invest large
amounts, and a large class of startups that need less than they
used to.  Increasingly, startups want a couple hundred thousand
dollars, not a couple million. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The opportunity is a lot less unexploited now.  Investors have
poured into this territory from both directions.  VCs are much more
likely to make angel-sized investments than they were a year ago.
And meanwhile the past year has seen a dramatic increase in a new
type of investor: the super-angel, who operates like an angel, but
using other people's money, like a VC.<br><br>Though a lot of investors are entering this territory, there is
still room for more.  The distribution of investors should mirror
the distribution of startups, which has the usual power law dropoff.
So there should be a lot more people investing tens or hundreds of
thousands than millions. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>In fact, it may be good for angels that there are more people doing
angel-sized deals, because if angel rounds become more legitimate,
then startups may start to opt for angel rounds even when they
could, if they wanted, raise series A rounds from VCs.  One reason
startups prefer series A rounds is that they're more prestigious.
But if angel investors become more active and better known, they'll
increasingly be able to compete with VCs in brand.<br><br>Of course, prestige isn't the main reason to prefer a series A
round.  A startup will probably get more attention from investors
in a series A round than an angel round.  So if a startup is choosing
between an angel round and an A round from a good VC fund, I usually
advise them to take the A round. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>But while series A rounds aren't going away, I think VCs should be
more worried about super-angels than vice versa.  Despite their
name, the super-angels are really mini VC funds, and they clearly
have existing VCs in their sights.<br><br>They would seem to have history on their side.  
The pattern here seems the same
one we see when startups and established companies enter a new
market.  Online video becomes possible, and YouTube plunges right
in, while existing media companies embrace it only half-willingly,
driven more by fear than hope, and aiming more to protect their
turf than to do great things for users.  Ditto for PayPal.  This
pattern is repeated over and over, and it's usually the invaders
who win. In this case the super-angels are the invaders.  Angel
rounds are their whole business, as online video was for YouTube.
Whereas VCs who make angel investments mostly do it as a way to
generate deal flow for series A rounds.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>On the other hand, startup investing is a very strange business.
Nearly all the returns are concentrated in a few big winners.  If
the super-angels merely fail to invest in (and to some extent
produce) the big winners, they'll be out of business, even if they
invest in all the others.<br><br><b>VCs</b><br><br>Why don't VCs start doing smaller series A rounds?  The sticking
point is board seats.  In a traditional series A round, the partner
whose deal it is takes a seat on the startup's board.  If we assume
the average startup runs for 6 years and a partner can bear to be
on 12 boards at once, then a VC fund can do 2 series A deals per
partner per year.<br><br>It has always seemed to me the solution is to take fewer board
seats.  You don't have to be on the board to help a startup.  Maybe
VCs feel they need the power that comes with board membership to
ensure their money isn't wasted.  But have they tested that theory?
Unless they've tried not taking board seats and found their returns
are lower, they're not bracketing the problem.<br><br>I'm not saying VCs don't help startups.  The good ones help them a
lot.  What I'm saying is that the kind of help that matters, you
may not have to be a board member to give.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>How will this all play out?  Some VCs will probably adapt, by doing
more, smaller deals.  I wouldn't be surprised if by streamlining
their selection process and taking fewer board seats, VC funds could
do 2 to 3 times as many series A rounds with no loss of quality.<br><br>But other VCs will make no more than superficial changes.  VCs are
conservative, and the threat to them isn't mortal.  The VC funds
that don't adapt won't be violently displaced.  They'll edge gradually
into a different business without realizing it.  They'll still do
what they will call series A rounds, but these will increasingly
be de facto series B rounds.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>In such rounds they won't get the 25 to 40% of the company they do
now.  You don't give up as much of the company in later rounds
unless something is seriously wrong.  Since the VCs who don't adapt
will be investing later, their returns from winners may be smaller.
But investing later should also mean they have fewer losers.  So
their ratio of risk to return may be the same or even better.
They'll just have become a different, more conservative, type of
investment.<br><br><b>Angels</b><br><br>In the big angel rounds that increasingly compete with series A
rounds, the investors won't take as much equity as VCs do now.  And
VCs who try to compete with angels by doing more, smaller deals
will probably find they have to take less equity to do it. Which
is good news for founders: they'll get to keep more of the company.<br><br>The deal terms of angel rounds will become less restrictive
too—not just less restrictive than series A terms, but less
restrictive than angel terms have traditionally been.<br><br>In the future, angel rounds will less often be for specific amounts
or have a lead investor.  In the old days, the standard m.o. for
startups was to find one angel to act as the lead investor.  You'd
negotiate a round size and valuation with the lead, who'd supply
some but not all of the money.  Then the startup and the lead would
cooperate to find the rest.<br><br>The future of angel rounds looks more like this: instead of a fixed
round size, startups will do a rolling close, where they take money
from investors one at a time till they feel they have enough.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
And though there's going to be one investor who gives them the first
check, and his or her help in recruiting other investors will
certainly be welcome, this initial investor will no longer be the
lead in the old sense of managing the round.  The startup will now
do that themselves.<br><br>There will continue to be lead investors in the sense of investors
who take the lead in <i>advising</i> a startup.  They may also make
the biggest investment.  But they won't always have to be the one
terms are negotiated with, or be the first money in, as they have
in the past.  Standardized paperwork will do away with the need to
negotiate anything except the valuation, and that will get easier
too.<br><br>If multiple investors have to share a valuation, it will be whatever
the startup can get from the first one to write a check, limited
by their guess at whether this will make later investors balk.  But
there may not have to be just one valuation.  Startups are increasingly
raising money on convertible notes, and convertible notes have not
valuations but at most valuation <i>caps</i>: caps on what the
effective valuation will be when the debt converts to equity (in a
later round, or upon acquisition if that happens first).  That's
an important difference because it means a startup could do multiple
notes at once with different caps.  This is now starting to happen,
and I predict it will become more common.<br><br><b>Sheep</b><br><br>The reason things are moving this way is that the old way sucked
for startups.  Leads could (and did) use a fixed size round as a
legitimate-seeming way of saying what all founders hate to hear:
I'll invest if other people will.  Most investors, unable to judge
startups for themselves, rely instead on the opinions of other
investors.  If everyone wants in, they want in too; if not, not.
Founders hate this because it's a recipe for deadlock, and delay
is the thing a startup can least afford.  Most investors know this
m.o. is lame, and few say openly that they're doing it.  But the
craftier ones achieve the same result by offering to lead rounds
of fixed size and supplying only part of the money.  If the startup
can't raise the rest, the lead is out too.  How could they go ahead
with the deal?  The startup would be underfunded!<br><br>In the future, investors will increasingly be unable to offer
investment subject to contingencies like other people investing.
Or rather, investors who do that will get last place in line.
Startups will go to them only to fill up rounds that are mostly
subscribed.  And since hot startups tend to have rounds that are
oversubscribed, being last in line means they'll probably miss the
hot deals.  Hot deals and successful startups are not identical,
but there is a significant correlation. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font>
So investors who won't invest unilaterally will have lower returns.<br><br>Investors will probably find they do better when deprived of this
crutch anyway.   Chasing hot deals doesn't make investors choose
better; it just makes them feel better about their choices.  I've
seen feeding frenzies both form and fall apart many times, and as
far as I can tell they're mostly random. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font>
If investors can
no longer rely on their herd instincts, they'll have to think more
about each startup before investing.  They may be surprised how
well this works.<br><br>Deadlock wasn't the only disadvantage of letting a lead investor
manage an angel round.  The investors would not infrequently collude
to push down the valuation.  And rounds took too long to close,
because however motivated the lead was to get the round closed, he
was not a tenth as motivated as the startup.<br><br>Increasingly, startups are taking charge of their own angel rounds.
Only a few do so far, but I think we can already declare the old
way dead, because those few are the best startups.  They're the
ones in a position to tell investors how the round is going to work.
And if the startups you want to invest in do things a certain way,
what difference does it make what the others do?<br><br><b>Traction</b><br><br>In fact, it may be slightly misleading to say that angel rounds
will increasingly take the place of series A rounds.  What's really
happening is that startup-controlled rounds are taking the place
of investor-controlled rounds.<br><br>This is an instance of a very important meta-trend, one that Y
Combinator itself has been based on from the beginning: founders
are becoming increasingly powerful relative to investors.  So if
you want to predict what the future of venture funding will be like,
just ask: how would founders like it to be?  One by one, all the
things founders dislike about raising money are going to get
eliminated. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>Using that heuristic, I'll predict a couple more things.  One is
that investors will increasingly be unable to wait for startups to
have "traction" before they put in significant money.  It's hard
to predict in advance which startups will succeed.  So most investors
prefer, if they can, to wait till the startup is already succeeding,
then jump in quickly with an offer.  Startups hate this as well,
partly because it tends to create deadlock, and partly because it
seems kind of slimy.  If you're a promising startup but don't yet
have significant growth, all the investors are your friends in
words, but few are in actions.  They all say they love you, but
they all wait to invest. Then when you start to see growth, they
claim they were your friend all along, and are aghast at the thought
you'd be so disloyal as to leave them out of your round.  If founders
become more powerful, they'll be able to make investors give them
more money upfront.<br><br>(The worst variant of this behavior is the tranched deal, where the
investor makes a small initial investment, with more to follow if
the startup does well.  In effect, this structure gives the investor
a free option on the next round, which they'll only take if it's
worse for the startup than they could get in the open market.
Tranched deals are an abuse.  They're increasingly rare, and they're
going to get rarer.) 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>Investors don't like trying to predict which startups will succeed,
but increasingly they'll have to.  Though the way that happens won't
necessarily be that the behavior of existing investors will change;
it may instead be that they'll be replaced by other investors with
different behavior—that investors who understand startups
well enough to take on the hard problem of predicting their trajectory
will tend to displace suits whose skills lie more in raising money
from LPs.<br><br><b>Speed</b><br><br>The other thing founders hate most about fundraising is how long
it takes.  So as founders become more powerful, rounds should start
to close faster.<br><br>Fundraising is still terribly distracting for startups. If you're
a founder in the middle of raising a round, the round is the <a href="top.html">top idea in your mind</a>, which means working on the
company isn't.  If a round takes 2 months to close, which is
reasonably fast by present standards, that means 2 months during
which the company is basically treading water.  That's the worst
thing a startup could do.<br><br>So if investors want to get the best deals, the way to do it will
be to close faster.   Investors don't need weeks to make up their
minds anyway.  We decide based on about 10 minutes of reading an
application plus 10 minutes of in person interview, and we only
regret about 10% of our decisions.  If we can decide in 20 minutes,
surely the next round of investors can decide in a couple days.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>There are a lot of institutionalized delays in startup funding: the
multi-week mating dance with investors; the distinction between
termsheets and deals; the fact that each series A has enormously
elaborate, custom paperwork.  Both founders and investors tend to
take these for granted.  It's the way things have always been.  But
ultimately the reason these delays exist is that they're to the
advantage of investors.  More time gives investors more information
about a startup's trajectory, and it also tends to make startups
more pliable in negotiations, since they're usually short of money.<br><br>These conventions weren't designed to drag out the funding process,
but that's why they're allowed to persist.  Slowness is to the
advantage of investors, who have in the past been the ones with the
most power.  But there is no need for rounds to take months or even
weeks to close, and once founders realize that, it's going to stop.
Not just in angel rounds, but in series A rounds too.  The future
is simple deals with standard terms, done quickly.<br><br>One minor abuse that will get corrected in the process is option
pools.  In a traditional series A round, before the VCs invest they
make the company set aside a block of stock for future hires—usually
between 10 and 30% of the company.  The point is to ensure this
dilution is borne by the existing shareholders.  The practice isn't
dishonest; founders know what's going on.  But it makes deals
unnecessarily complicated.  In effect the valuation is 2 numbers.
There's no need to keep doing this.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>The final thing founders want is to be able to sell some of
their own stock in later rounds.  This won't be a change, 
because the practice is now quite common.  A lot of investors
hated the idea, but the world hasn't exploded as a result,
so it will happen more, and more openly.<br><br><b>Surprise</b><br><br>I've talked here about a bunch of changes that will be forced on
investors as founders become more powerful.  Now the good news:
investors may actually make more money as a result.<br><br>A couple days ago an interviewer 
<a href="http://techcrunch.tv/watch?id=Q3amZtMTryrpiP80cbUtsV2ah92eZP2m">asked 
me</a> if founders having more
power would be better or worse for the world.  I was surprised,
because I'd never considered that question.  Better or worse, it's
happening.  But after a second's reflection, the answer seemed
obvious.  Founders understand their companies better than investors,
and it has to be better if the people with more knowledge have more
power.<br><br>One of the mistakes novice pilots make is overcontrolling the
aircraft: applying corrections too vigorously, so the aircraft
oscillates about the desired configuration instead of approaching
it asymptotically.  It seems probable that investors have till now
on average been overcontrolling their portfolio companies.  In a
lot of startups, the biggest source of stress for the founders is
not competitors but investors.  Certainly it was for us at Viaweb.
And this is not a new phenomenon: investors were James Watt's biggest
problem too.   If having less power prevents investors from
overcontrolling startups, it should be better not just for founders
but for investors too.<br><br>Investors may end up with less stock per startup, but startups will
probably do better with founders more in control, and there will
almost certainly be more of them.  Investors all compete with one
another for deals, but they aren't one another's main competitor.
Our main competitor is employers.  And so far that competitor is
crushing us.  Only a tiny fraction of people who could start a
startup do.  Nearly all customers choose the competing product, a
job.  Why?  Well, let's look at the product we're offering.  An
unbiased review would go something like this:
</xa></p><blockquote>
  Starting a startup gives you more freedom and the opportunity to
  make a lot more money than a job, but it's also hard work and at
  times very stressful.
</blockquote>
Much of the stress comes from dealing with investors.  If reforming
the investment process removed that stress, we'd make our product
much more attractive.  The kind of people who make good startup
founders don't mind dealing with technical problems—they enjoy
technical problems—but they hate the type of problems investors
cause.<br><br>Investors have no
idea that when they maltreat one startup, they're preventing 10
others from happening, but they are.  Indirectly, but they are.  So
when investors stop trying to squeeze a little more out of their
existing deals, they'll find they're net ahead, because so many
more new deals appear.<br><br>One of our axioms at Y Combinator is not to think of deal flow as
a zero-sum game.  Our main focus is to encourage more startups to happen,
not to win a larger share of the existing stream.  We've found this
principle very useful, and we think as it spreads outward it will
help later stage investors as well.<br><br>"Make something people want"
applies to us too.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
In this essay I'm talking mainly about software startups.
These points don't apply to types of startups that are still expensive
to start, e.g. in energy or biotech.<br><br>Even the cheap kinds of startups will generally raise large amounts
at some point, when they want to hire a lot of people.  What has
changed is how much they can get done before that.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
It's not the distribution of good startups that has a power
law dropoff, but the distribution of potentially good startups,
which is to say, good deals.  There are lots of potential winners,
from which a few actual winners emerge with superlinear certainty.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
As I was writing this, I asked some founders who'd taken
series A rounds from top VC funds whether it was worth it, and they
unanimously said yes.<br><br>The quality of investor is more important than the type of round,
though.  I'd take an angel round from good angels over a series A
from a mediocre VC.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Founders also worry that taking an angel investment from a
VC means they'll look bad if the VC declines to participate in the
next round.  The trend of VC angel investing is so new that it's
hard to say how justified this worry is.<br><br>Another danger, pointed out by Mitch Kapor, is that if VCs are only
doing angel deals to generate series A deal flow, then their
incentives aren't aligned with the founders'.  The founders want
the valuation of the next round to be high, and the VCs want it to
be low.  Again, hard to say yet how much of a problem this will be.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Josh Kopelman pointed out that another way to be on fewer
boards at once is to take board seats for shorter periods.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Google was in this respect as so many others the pattern for
the future.  It would be great for VCs if the similarity extended
to returns.  That's probably too much to hope for, but the returns
may be somewhat higher, as I explain later.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Doing a rolling close doesn't mean the company is always
raising money.  That would be a distraction.  The point of a rolling
close is to make fundraising take less time, not more.  With a
classic fixed sized round, you don't get any money till all the
investors agree, and that often creates a situation where they all
sit waiting for the others to act.  A rolling close usually prevents
this.<br><br><!-- [<a name="f8n"><font color=#000000>8</font></a>]
Jeff Clavier pointed out a tax disadvantage of convertible
notes: they don't start the long term capital gains clock.  So
perhaps the ultimate solution, after investors have been conditioned
to do simpler deals with multiple caps by convertible notes, is
eventually to do equity rounds that approach the same simplicity
and flexibility.
-->
[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
There are two (non-exclusive) causes of hot deals: the quality
of the company, and domino effects among investors.  The former is
obviously a better predictor of success.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Some of the randomness is concealed by the fact that investment
is a self fulfilling prophecy.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
The shift in power to founders is exaggerated now because
it's a seller's market.  On the next downtick it will seem like I
overstated the case.  But on the next uptick after that, founders
will seem more powerful than ever.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
More generally, it will become less common for the same
investor to invest in successive rounds, except when exercising an
option to maintain their percentage.  When the same investor invests
in successive rounds, it often means the startup isn't getting
market price.  They may not care; they may prefer to work with an
investor they already know; but as the investment market becomes
more efficient, it will become increasingly easy to get market price
if they want it.  Which in turn means the investment community will
tend to become more stratified.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
The two 10 minuteses have 3 weeks between them so founders
can get cheap plane tickets, but except for that they could be
adjacent.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
I'm not saying option pools themselves will go away.  They're
an administrative convenience.  What will go away is investors
requiring them.<br><br><br><br>

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
August 2010<br><br>When I went to work for Yahoo after they bought our startup in 1998,
it felt like the center of the world.  It was supposed to be the
next big thing.  It was supposed to be what Google turned out to
be.<br><br>What went wrong?  The problems that hosed Yahoo go back a long time,
practically to the beginning of the company.  They were already
very visible when I got there in 1998.  Yahoo had two problems
Google didn't: easy money, and ambivalence about being a technology
company.<br><br><b>Money</b><br><br>The first time I met Jerry Yang, we thought we were meeting for
different reasons.  He thought we were meeting so he could check
us out in person before buying us. I thought we were meeting so we
could show him our new technology, Revenue Loop.   It was a way of
sorting shopping search results.  Merchants bid a percentage of
sales for traffic, but the results were sorted not by the bid but
by the bid times the average amount a user would buy.  It was
like the algorithm Google uses now to sort ads, but this was in the
spring of 1998, before Google was founded.<br><br>Revenue Loop was the optimal sort for shopping search, in the sense
that it sorted in order of how much money Yahoo would make from
each link.  But it wasn't just optimal in that sense.  Ranking
search results by user behavior also makes search better.  Users
train the search: you can start out finding matches based on mere
textual similarity, and as users buy more stuff the search results
get better and better.<br><br>Jerry didn't seem to care.  I was confused.  I was showing him
technology that extracted the maximum value from search traffic,
and he didn't care?  I couldn't tell whether I was explaining it
badly, or he was just very poker faced.<br><br>I didn't realize the answer till later, after I went to work at
Yahoo.  It was neither of my guesses.  The reason Yahoo didn't care
about a technique that extracted the full value of traffic was that
advertisers were already overpaying for it.  If Yahoo merely extracted
the actual value, they'd have made less.<br><br>Hard as it is to believe now, the big money then was in banner ads.
Advertisers were willing to pay ridiculous amounts for banner ads.
So Yahoo's sales force had evolved to exploit this source of revenue.
Led by a large and terrifyingly formidable man called Anil Singh,
Yahoo's sales guys would fly out to Procter &amp; Gamble and come back
with million dollar orders for banner ad impressions.<br><br>The prices seemed cheap compared to print, which was what advertisers,
for lack of any other reference, compared them to.  But they were
expensive compared to what they were worth.  So these big, dumb
companies were a dangerous source of revenue to depend on.  But
there was another source even more dangerous: other Internet startups.<br><br>By 1998, Yahoo was the beneficiary of a de facto Ponzi scheme.
Investors were excited about the Internet.  One reason they were
excited was Yahoo's revenue growth.  So they invested in new Internet
startups.  The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to
get traffic.  Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and
further convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in.
When I realized this one day, sitting in my cubicle, I jumped up
like Archimedes in his bathtub, except instead of "Eureka!" I was
shouting "Sell!"<br><br>Both the Internet startups and the Procter &amp; Gambles were doing
brand advertising.  They didn't care about targeting.  They just
wanted lots of people to see their ads.  So traffic became the thing
to get at Yahoo.  It didn't matter what type.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>It wasn't just Yahoo.  All the search engines were doing it.  This
was why they were trying to get people to start calling them "portals"
instead of "search engines." Despite the actual meaning of the word
portal, what they meant by it was a site where users would find
what they wanted on the site itself, instead of just passing through
on their way to other destinations, as they did at a search engine.<br><br>I remember telling David Filo in late 1998 or early 1999 that Yahoo
should buy Google, because I and most of the other programmers in
the company were using it instead of Yahoo for search.  He told me
that it wasn't worth worrying about.  Search was only 6% of our
traffic, and we were growing at 10% a month.   It wasn't worth doing
better.<br><br>I didn't say "But search traffic is worth more than other traffic!"
I said "Oh, ok."  Because I didn't realize either how much search
traffic was worth.  I'm not sure even Larry and Sergey did then.
If they had, Google presumably wouldn't have expended any effort
on enterprise search.<br><br>If circumstances had been different, the people running Yahoo might
have realized sooner how important search was.  But they had the
most opaque obstacle in the world between them and the truth: money.
As long as customers were writing big checks for banner ads, it was
hard to take search seriously.  Google didn't have that to distract
them.<br><br><b>Hackers</b><br><br>But Yahoo also had another problem that made it hard to change
directions.  They'd been thrown off balance from the start by their
ambivalence about being a technology company.<br><br>One of the weirdest things about Yahoo when I went to work there
was the way they insisted on calling themselves a "media company."
If you walked around their offices, it seemed like a software
company.  The cubicles were full of programmers writing code, product
managers thinking about feature lists and ship dates, support people
(yes, there were actually support people) telling users to restart
their browsers, and so on, just like a software company.  So why
did they call themselves a media company?<br><br>One reason was the way they made money: by selling ads.  In 1995
it was hard to imagine a technology company making money that way.
Technology companies made money by selling their software to users.
Media companies sold ads.  So they must be a media company.<br><br>Another big factor was the fear of Microsoft.   If anyone at Yahoo
considered the idea that they should be a technology company, the
next thought would have been that Microsoft would crush them.<br><br>It's hard for anyone much younger than me to understand the fear
Microsoft still inspired in 1995.  Imagine a company with several
times the power Google has now, but way meaner.  It was perfectly
reasonable to be afraid of them.  Yahoo watched them crush the first
hot Internet company, Netscape.  It was reasonable to worry that
if they tried to be the next Netscape, they'd suffer the same fate.
How were they to know that Netscape would turn out to be Microsoft's
last victim?<br><br>It would have been a clever move to pretend to be a media company
to throw Microsoft off their scent.  But unfortunately Yahoo actually
tried to be one, sort of.  Project managers at Yahoo were called
"producers," for example, and the different parts of the company
were called "properties." But what Yahoo really needed to be was a
technology company, and by trying to be something else, they ended
up being something that was neither here nor there.  That's why
Yahoo as a company has never had a sharply defined identity.<br><br>The worst consequence of trying to be a media company was that they
didn't take programming seriously enough.  Microsoft (back in the
day), Google, and Facebook have all had hacker-centric cultures.
But Yahoo treated programming as a commodity.  At Yahoo, user-facing software
was controlled by product managers and designers.  The job of
programmers was just to take the work of the product managers and
designers the final step, by translating it into code.<br><br>One obvious result of this practice was that when Yahoo built things,
they often weren't very good. But that wasn't the worst problem.
The worst problem was that they hired bad programmers.<br><br>Microsoft (back in the day), Google, and Facebook have all been
obsessed with hiring the best programmers.  Yahoo wasn't.  They
preferred good programmers to bad ones, but they didn't have the
kind of single-minded, almost obnoxiously elitist focus on hiring
the smartest people that the big winners have had.  And when you
consider how much competition there was for programmers when they
were hiring, during the Bubble, it's not surprising that the quality
of their programmers was uneven.<br><br>In technology, once you have bad programmers, you're doomed.  I
can't think of an instance where a company has sunk into technical
mediocrity and recovered. Good programmers want to work with other
good programmers.  So once the quality of programmers at your company
starts to drop, you enter a death spiral from which there is no
recovery.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>At Yahoo this death spiral started early.  If there was ever a time when
Yahoo was a Google-style talent magnet, it was over by the time I
got there in 1998.<br><br>The company felt prematurely old.  Most technology companies
eventually get taken over by suits and middle managers.  At Yahoo
it felt as if they'd deliberately accelerated this process.  They
didn't want to be a bunch of hackers.  They wanted to be suits.  A
media company should be run by suits.<br><br>The first time I visited Google, they had about 500 people, the
same number Yahoo had when I went to work there.  But boy did things
seem different.  It was still very much a hacker-centric culture.
I remember talking to some programmers in the cafeteria about the
problem of gaming search results (now known as SEO), and they asked
"what should we do?"  Programmers at Yahoo wouldn't have asked that.
Theirs was not to reason why; theirs was to build what product
managers spec'd.  I remember coming away from Google thinking "Wow,
it's still a startup."<br><br>There's not much we can learn from Yahoo's first fatal flaw. It's
probably too much to hope any company could avoid being damaged by
depending on a bogus source of revenue.  But startups can learn an
important lesson from the second one.  In the software business,
you can't afford not to have a hacker-centric culture.<br><br>Probably the most impressive commitment I've heard to having a
hacker-centric culture came from Mark Zuckerberg, when he spoke at
Startup School in 2007.  He said that in the early days Facebook
made a point of hiring programmers even for jobs that would not
ordinarily consist of programming, like HR and marketing.<br><br>So which companies need to have a hacker-centric culture?  Which
companies are "in the software business" in this respect?  As Yahoo
discovered, the area covered by this rule is bigger than most people
realize.  The answer is: any company that needs to have good software.<br><br>Why would great programmers want to work for a company that didn't
have a hacker-centric culture, as long as there were others that
did?  I can imagine two reasons: if they were paid a huge amount,
or if the domain was interesting and none of the companies in it
were hacker-centric.  Otherwise you can't attract good programmers
to work in a suit-centric culture.  And without good programmers
you won't get good software, no matter how many people you put on
a task, or how many procedures you establish to ensure "quality."<br><br><a href="gba.html">Hacker culture</a> 
often seems kind of irresponsible.  That's why people
proposing to destroy it use phrases like "adult supervision." That
was the phrase they used at Yahoo.  But there are worse things than
seeming irresponsible.  Losing, for example.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
The closest we got to targeting when I was there was when we
created pets.yahoo.com in order to provoke a bidding war between 3
pet supply startups for the spot as top sponsor.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In theory you could beat the death spiral by buying good
programmers instead of hiring them.  You can get programmers
who would never have come to you as employees by buying their 
startups. But so far the only companies smart enough
to do this are companies smart enough not to need to.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
September 2010<br><br>The reason startups have been using 
<a href="http://twitter.com/paulg/status/22319113993">more convertible notes</a> in angel
rounds is that they make deals close faster.  By making it easier
for startups to give different prices to different investors, they
help them break the sort of deadlock that happens when investors
all wait to see who else is going to invest.<br><br>By far the biggest influence on investors' opinions of a startup
is the opinion of other investors.  There are very, very few who
simply decide for themselves.  Any startup founder can tell you the
most common question they hear from investors is not about the
founders or the product, but "who else is investing?"<br><br>That tends to produce deadlocks.  Raising an old-fashioned 
fixed-size equity round can take weeks, because all the angels sit around
waiting for the others to commit, like competitors in a bicycle
sprint who deliberately ride slowly at the start so they can follow
whoever breaks first.<br><br>Convertible notes let startups beat such deadlocks by rewarding
investors willing to move first with lower (effective) valuations.
Which they deserve because they're taking more risk.  It's much
safer to invest in a startup Ron Conway has already invested in;
someone who comes after him should pay a higher price.<br><br>The reason convertible notes allow more flexibility in price is
that valuation caps aren't actual valuations, and notes are cheap
and easy to do.  So you can do high-resolution fundraising: if you
wanted you could have a separate note with a different cap for each
investor.<br><br>That cap need not simply rise monotonically.  A startup could 
also give better deals to investors they expected to help
them most.  The point is simply that different investors, 
whether because of the help they offer or their willingness to
commit, have different values for
startups, and their terms should reflect that.<br><br>Different terms for different investors is
clearly the way of the future.  Markets always evolve toward higher
resolution.  You may not need to use convertible notes to do it.
With sufficiently lightweight standardized equity terms (and some
changes in investors' and lawyers' expectations about equity rounds)
you might be able to do the same thing with equity instead of debt.
Either would be fine with startups, so long as they can easily
change their valuation.<br><br>Deadlocks weren't the only problem with fixed-size equity rounds.
Another was that startups had to decide in advance how much to
raise.  I think it's a mistake for a startup to fix upon a specific
number. If investors are easily convinced, the startup should raise more
now, and if investors are skeptical, the startup should take a
smaller amount and use that to get the company to the point where
it's more convincing.<br><br>It's just not reasonable to expect startups to pick an optimal round
size in advance, because that depends on the reactions of investors,
and those are impossible to predict.<br><br>Fixed-size, multi-investor angel rounds are such a bad idea for
startups that one wonders why things were ever done that way.  One
possibility is that this custom reflects the way investors like to
collude when they can get away with it.  But I think the actual
explanation is less sinister.  I think angels (and their lawyers)
organized rounds this way in unthinking imitation of VC series A
rounds.  In a series A, a fixed-size equity round with a lead makes
sense, because there is usually just one big investor, who is
unequivocally the lead.  Fixed-size series A rounds already are
high res.  But the more investors you have in a round, the less
sense it makes for everyone to get the same price.<br><br>The most interesting question here may be what high res fundraising
will do to the world of investors.  Bolder investors will now get
rewarded with lower prices.  But more important, in a
hits-driven business, is that they'll be able to get into the deals
they want.  Whereas the "who else is investing?" type of investors
will not only pay higher prices, but may not be able to get into
the best deals at all.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Immad Akhund, Sam Altman, John Bautista, Pete Koomen,

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
October 2010<br><br>Silicon Valley proper is mostly suburban sprawl.  At first glance
it doesn't seem there's anything to see.  It's not the sort of place
that has conspicuous monuments.  But if you look, there are subtle
signs you're in a place that's different from other places.<br><br><b>1. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=stanford+university">Stanford
University</a></b><br><br>Stanford is a strange place.  Structurally it is to an ordinary
university what suburbia is to a city.  It's enormously spread out,
and feels surprisingly empty much of the time.  But notice the
weather.  It's probably perfect.  And notice the beautiful mountains
to the west.  And though you can't see it, cosmopolitan San Francisco
is 40 minutes to the north.  That combination is much of the reason
Silicon Valley grew up around this university and not some other
one.<br><br><b>2. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=university+and+ramona+palo+alto">University
Ave</a></b><br><br>A surprising amount of the work of the Valley is done in the cafes
on or just off University Ave in Palo Alto.  If you visit on a
weekday between 10 and 5, you'll often see founders pitching
investors.  In case you can't tell, the founders are the ones leaning
forward eagerly, and the investors are the ones sitting back with
slightly pained expressions.<br><br><b>3.  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=165+university+ave+palo+alto">The Lucky
Office</a></b><br><br>The office at 165 University Ave was Google's first.  Then it was
Paypal's.  (Now it's <a href="http://wepay.com">Wepay</a>'s.)  The interesting thing about it is
the location.  It's a smart move to put a startup in a place with
restaurants and people walking around instead of in an office park,
because then the people who work there want to stay there, instead
of fleeing as soon as conventional working hours end.  They go out
for dinner together, talk about ideas, and then come back and
implement them.<br><br>It's important to realize that Google's current location in an
office park is not where they started; it's just where they were
forced to move when they needed more space.  Facebook was till
recently across the street, till they too had to move because they
needed more space.<br><br><b>4. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=old+palo+alto">Old
Palo Alto</a></b><br><br>Palo Alto was not originally a suburb.  For the first 100 years or
so of its existence, it was a college town out in the countryside.
Then in the mid 1950s it was engulfed in a wave of suburbia that
raced down the peninsula.  But Palo Alto north of Oregon expressway
still feels noticeably different from the area around it.  It's one
of the nicest places in the Valley.  The buildings are old (though
increasingly they are being torn down and replaced with generic
McMansions) and the trees are tall.  But houses are very
expensive—around $1000 per square foot. This is post-exit
Silicon Valley.<br><br>
<b>5. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2900+sand+hill+road+menlo+park">Sand
Hill Road</a></b><br><br>It's interesting to see the VCs' offices on the north side of Sand
Hill Road precisely because they're so boringly uniform.  The
buildings are all more or less the same, their exteriors express
very little, and they are arranged in a confusing maze.  (I've been
visiting them for years and I still occasionally get lost.) It's
not a coincidence.  These buildings are a pretty accurate reflection
of the VC business.<br><br>If you go on a weekday you may see groups of founders there to meet
VCs. But mostly you won't see anyone; bustling is the last word
you'd use to describe the atmos.  Visiting Sand Hill Road reminds
you that the opposite of "down and dirty" would be "up and clean."<br><br><b>6.  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=castro+and+villa+mountain+view">Castro
Street</a></b><br><br>It's a tossup whether Castro Street or University Ave should be
considered the heart of the Valley now.  University Ave would have
been 10 years ago.  But Palo Alto is getting expensive.  Increasingly
startups are located in Mountain View, and Palo Alto is a place
they come to meet investors.  Palo Alto has a lot of different
cafes, but there is one that clearly dominates in Mountain View:
<a href="http://maps.google.com/places/us/ca/mountain-view/castro-st/201/-red-rock-coffee">Red
Rock</a>.<br><br><b>7. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=charleston+road+mountain+view">Google</a></b><br><br>Google spread out from its first building in Mountain View 
to a lot of the surrounding ones.  But because the
buildings were built at different times by different people,
the place doesn't have the sterile, walled-off feel that a typical
large company's headquarters have.  It definitely has a flavor of
its own though.  You sense there is something afoot.  The general
atmos is vaguely utopian; there are lots of Priuses, and people who
look like they drive them.<br><br>You can't get into Google unless you know someone there.  It's very
much worth seeing inside if you can, though.   Ditto for Facebook,
at the end of California Ave in Palo Alto, though there is nothing
to see outside.<br><br><b>8.  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=skylonda">Skyline
Drive</a></b><br><br>Skyline Drive runs along the crest of the Santa Cruz mountains.  On
one side is the Valley, and on the other is the sea—which
because it's cold and foggy and has few harbors, plays surprisingly
little role in the lives of people in the Valley, considering how
close it is.  Along some parts of Skyline the dominant trees are
huge redwoods, and in others they're live oaks.  Redwoods mean those
are the parts where the fog off the coast comes in at night; redwoods
condense rain out of fog.  The MROSD manages a collection of <a href="http://www.openspace.org/">great walking trails</a> off
Skyline.<br><br><b>9. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=interstate+280+san+mateo">280</a></b><br><br>Silicon Valley has two highways running the length of it: 101, which
is pretty ugly, and 280, which is one of the more beautiful highways
in the world.  I always take 280 when I have a choice.  Notice the
long narrow lake to the west? That's the San Andreas Fault.  It
runs along the base of the hills, then heads uphill through Portola
Valley.  One of the MROSD trails runs <a href="http://www.openspace.org/preserves/pr_los_trancos.asp">right along
the fault</a>.  A string of rich neighborhoods runs along the
foothills to the west of 280: Woodside, Portola Valley, Los Altos
Hills, Saratoga, Los Gatos.<br><br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/38037974@N00/3890299362/">SLAC</a> goes right under 280 a little bit south of Sand Hill Road.  And a couple miles south of that is the Valley's equivalent of the "Welcome to Las Vegas" sign: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulbarroga/3443486941/">The Dish</a>.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>I skipped the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/">Computer
History Museum</a> because this is a list of where to see the Valley
itself, not where to see artifacts from it.  I also skipped San
Jose.  San Jose calls itself the capital of Silicon Valley, but
when people in the Valley use the phrase "the city," they mean San
Francisco.  San Jose is a dotted line on a map.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, and Jessica Livingston

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
October 2010<br><br>After barely changing at all for decades, the startup funding
business is now in what could, at least by comparison, be called
turmoil.  At Y Combinator we've seen dramatic changes in the funding
environment for startups.  Fortunately one of them is much higher
valuations.<br><br>The trends we've been seeing are probably not YC-specific.  I wish
I could say they were, but the main cause is probably just that we
see trends first—partly because the startups we fund are very
plugged into the Valley and are quick to take advantage of anything
new, and partly because we fund so many that we have enough data
points to see patterns clearly.<br><br>What we're seeing now, everyone's probably going to be seeing in
the next couple years.  So I'm going to explain what we're seeing,
and what that will mean for you if you try to raise money.<br><br><b>Super-Angels</b><br><br>Let me start by describing what the world of startup funding used
to look like.  There used to be two sharply differentiated types
of investors: angels and venture capitalists.  Angels are individual
rich people who invest small amounts of their own money, while VCs
are employees of funds that invest large amounts of other people's.<br><br>For decades there were just those two types of investors, but now
a third type has appeared halfway between them: the so-called
super-angels. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
  And VCs have been provoked by their arrival
into making a lot of angel-style investments themselves.  So the
previously sharp line between angels and VCs has become hopelessly
blurred.<br><br>There used to be a no man's land between angels and VCs.  Angels
would invest $20k to $50k apiece, and VCs usually a million or more.
So an angel round meant a collection of angel investments that
combined to maybe $200k, and a VC round meant a series A round in
which a single VC fund (or occasionally two) invested $1-5 million.<br><br>The no man's land between angels and VCs was a very inconvenient
one for startups, because it coincided with the amount many wanted
to raise.  Most startups coming out of Demo Day wanted to raise
around $400k.  But it was a pain to stitch together that much out
of angel investments, and most VCs weren't interested in investments
so small.  That's the fundamental reason the super-angels have
appeared.  They're responding to the market.<br><br>The arrival of a new type of investor is big news for startups,
because there used to be only two and they rarely competed with one
another.  Super-angels compete with both angels and VCs.  That's
going to change the rules about how to raise money.  I don't know
yet what the new rules will be, but it looks like most of the changes
will be for the better.<br><br>A super-angel has some of the qualities of an angel, and some of
the qualities of a VC.  They're usually individuals, like angels.
In fact many of the current super-angels were initially angels of
the classic type.  But like VCs, they invest other people's money.
This allows them to invest larger amounts than angels:  a typical
super-angel investment is currently about $100k.  They make investment
decisions quickly, like angels.  And they make a lot more investments
per partner than VCs—up to 10 times as many.<br><br>The fact that super-angels invest other people's money makes them
doubly alarming to VCs. They don't just compete for startups; they
also compete for investors.  What super-angels really are is a new
form of fast-moving, lightweight VC fund.   And those of us in the
technology world know what usually happens when something comes
along that can be described in terms like that.  Usually it's the
replacement.<br><br>Will it be?  As of now, few of the startups that take money from
super-angels are ruling out taking VC money.  They're just postponing
it.  But that's still a problem for VCs.  Some of the startups that
postpone raising VC money may do so well on the angel money they
raise that they never bother to raise more.  And those who do raise
VC rounds will be able to get higher valuations when they do.  If
the best startups get 10x higher valuations when they raise series
A rounds, that would cut VCs' returns from winners at least tenfold.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>So I think VC funds are seriously threatened by the super-angels.
But one thing that may save them to some extent is the uneven
distribution of startup outcomes: practically all the returns are
concentrated in a few big successes.  The expected value of a startup
is the percentage chance it's Google.  So to the extent that winning
is a matter of absolute returns, the super-angels could win practically
all the battles for individual startups and yet lose the war, if
they merely failed to get those few big winners.  And there's a
chance that could happen, because the top VC funds have better
brands, and can also do more for their portfolio companies.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Because super-angels make more investments per partner, they have
less partner per investment.  They can't pay as much attention to
you as a VC on your board could.  How much is that extra attention
worth?  It will vary enormously from one partner to another.  There's
no consensus yet in the general case.  So for now this is something
startups are deciding individually.<br><br>Till now, VCs' claims about how much value they added were sort of
like the government's.  Maybe they made you feel better, but you
had no choice in the matter, if you needed money on the scale only
VCs could supply.  Now that VCs have competitors, that's going to
put a market price on the help they offer.  The interesting thing
is, no one knows yet what it will be.<br><br>Do startups that want to get really big need the sort of advice and
connections only the top VCs can supply?  Or would super-angel money
do just as well?  The VCs will say you need them, and the super-angels
will say you don't.  But the truth is, no one knows yet, not even
the VCs and super-angels themselves.   All the super-angels know
is that their new model seems promising enough to be worth trying,
and all the VCs know is that it seems promising enough to worry
about.<br><br><b>Rounds</b><br><br>Whatever the outcome, the conflict between VCs and super-angels is
good news for founders.  And not just for the obvious reason that
more competition for deals means better terms.  The whole shape of
deals is changing.<br><br>One of the biggest differences between angels and VCs is the amount
of your company they want.  VCs want a lot.  In a series A round
they want a third of your company, if they can get it.  They don't
care much how much they pay for it, but they want a lot because the
number of series A investments they can do is so small.  In a
traditional series A investment, at least one partner from the VC
fund takes a seat on your board.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
 Since board seats last about
5 years and each partner can't handle more than about 10 at once,
that means a VC fund can only do about 2 series A deals per partner
per year. And that means they need to get as much of the company
as they can in each one.  You'd have to be a very promising startup
indeed to get a VC to use up one of his 10 board seats for only a
few percent of you.<br><br>Since angels generally don't take board seats, they don't have this
constraint.  They're happy to buy only a few percent of you.  And
although the super-angels are in most respects mini VC funds, they've
retained this critical property of angels.  They don't take board
seats, so they don't need a big percentage of your company.<br><br>Though that means you'll get correspondingly less attention from
them, it's good news in other respects.  Founders never really liked
giving up as much equity as VCs wanted.  It was a lot of the company
to give up in one shot.  Most founders doing series A deals would
prefer to take half as much money for half as much stock, and then
see what valuation they could get for the second half of the stock
after using the first half of the money to increase its value.  But
VCs never offered that option.<br><br>Now startups have another alternative.  Now it's easy to raise angel
rounds about half the size of series A rounds.  Many of the startups
we fund are taking this route, and I predict that will be true of
startups in general.<br><br>A typical big angel round might be $600k on a convertible note with
a valuation cap of $4 million premoney.  Meaning that when the note
converts into stock (in a later round, or upon acquisition), the
investors in that round will get .6 / 4.6, or 13% of the company.
That's a lot less than the 30 to 40% of the company you usually
give up in a series A round if you do it so early.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>But the advantage of these medium-sized rounds is not just that
they cause less dilution.  You also lose less control.  After an
angel round, the founders almost always still have control of the
company, whereas after a series A round they often don't.  The
traditional board structure after a series A round is two founders,
two VCs, and a (supposedly) neutral fifth person.  Plus series A
terms usually give the investors a veto over various kinds of
important decisions, including selling the company.  Founders usually
have a lot of de facto control after a series A, as long as things
are going well.  But that's not the same as just being able to do
what you want, like you could before.<br><br>A third and quite significant advantage of angel rounds is that
they're less stressful to raise.  Raising a traditional series A
round has in the past taken weeks, if not months.  When a VC firm
can only do 2 deals per partner per year, they're careful about
which they do.  To get a traditional series A round you have to go
through a series of meetings, culminating in a full partner meeting
where the firm as a whole says yes or no.  That's the really scary
part for founders: not just that series A rounds take so long, but
at the end of this long process the VCs might still say no.  The
chance of getting rejected after the full partner meeting averages
about 25%.  At some firms it's over 50%.<br><br>Fortunately for founders, VCs have been getting a lot faster.
Nowadays Valley VCs are more likely to take 2 weeks than 2 months.
But they're still not as fast as angels and super-angels, the most
decisive of whom sometimes decide in hours.<br><br>Raising an angel round is not only quicker, but you get feedback
as it progresses.  An angel round is not an all or nothing thing
like a series A.  It's composed of multiple investors with varying
degrees of seriousness, ranging from the upstanding ones who commit
unequivocally to the jerks who give you lines like "come back to
me to fill out the round." You usually start collecting money from
the most committed investors and work your way out toward the
ambivalent ones, whose interest increases as the round fills up.<br><br>But at each point you know how you're doing.  If investors turn
cold you may have to raise less, but when investors in an angel
round turn cold the process at least degrades gracefully, instead
of blowing up in your face and leaving you with nothing, as happens
if you get rejected by a VC fund after a full partner meeting.
Whereas if investors seem hot, you can not only close the round
faster, but now that convertible notes are becoming the norm,
actually <a href="hiresfund.html">raise the price</a> to reflect demand.<br><br><b>Valuation</b><br><br>However, the VCs have a weapon they can use against the super-angels,
and they have started to use it.   VCs have started making angel-sized
investments too.  The term "angel round" doesn't mean that all the
investors in it are angels; it just describes the structure of the
round.  Increasingly the participants include VCs making investments
of a hundred thousand or two.  And when VCs invest in angel rounds
they can do things that super-angels don't like.  VCs are quite
valuation-insensitive in angel rounds—partly because they are
in general, and partly because they don't care that much about the
returns on angel rounds, which they still view mostly as a way to
recruit startups for series A rounds later.  So VCs who invest in
angel rounds can blow up the valuations for angels and super-angels
who invest in them. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Some super-angels seem to care about valuations.  Several turned
down YC-funded startups after Demo Day because their valuations
were too high.  This was not a problem for the startups; by definition
a high valuation means enough investors were willing to accept it.
But it was mysterious to me that the super-angels would quibble
about valuations.  Did they not understand that the big returns
come from a few big successes, and that it therefore mattered far
more which startups you picked than how much you paid for them?<br><br>After thinking about it for a while and observing certain other
signs, I have a theory that explains why the super-angels may be
smarter than they seem.  It would make sense for super-angels to
want low valuations if they're hoping to invest in startups that
get bought early.  If you're hoping to hit the next Google, you
shouldn't care if the valuation is 20 million.  But if you're looking
for companies that are going to get bought for 30 million, you care.
If you invest at 20 and the company gets bought for 30, you only
get 1.5x.  You might as well buy Apple.<br><br>So if some of the super-angels were looking for companies that could
get acquired quickly, that would explain why they'd care about
valuations.  But why would they be looking for those?   Because
depending on the meaning of "quickly," it could actually be very
profitable.  A company that gets acquired for 30 million is a failure
to a VC, but it could be a 10x return for an angel, and moreover,
a <i>quick</i> 10x return.  Rate of return is what matters in
investing—not the multiple you get, but the multiple per year.
If a super-angel gets 10x in one year, that's a higher rate of
return than a VC could ever hope to get from a company that took 6
years to go public.  To get the same rate of return, the VC would
have to get a multiple of 10^6—one million x.  Even Google
didn't come close to that.<br><br>So I think at least some super-angels are looking for companies
that will get bought.  That's the only rational explanation for
focusing on getting the right valuations, instead of the right
companies.  And if so they'll be different to deal with than VCs.
They'll be tougher on valuations, but more accommodating if you want
to sell early.<br><br><b>Prognosis</b><br><br>Who will win, the super-angels or the VCs?  I think the answer to
that is, some of each.  They'll each become more like one another.
The super-angels will start to invest larger amounts, and the VCs
will gradually figure out ways to make more, smaller investments
faster.  A decade from now the players will be hard to tell apart,
and there will probably be survivors from each group.<br><br>What does that mean for founders?  One thing it means is that the
high valuations startups are presently getting may not last forever.
To the extent that valuations are being driven up by price-insensitive
VCs, they'll fall again if VCs become more like super-angels and
start to become more miserly about valuations.  Fortunately if this
does happen it will take years.<br><br>The short term forecast is more competition between investors, which
is good news for you.  The super-angels will try to undermine the
VCs by acting faster, and the VCs will try to undermine the
super-angels by driving up valuations.  Which for founders will
result in the perfect combination: funding rounds that close fast,
with high valuations.<br><br>But remember that to get that combination, your startup will have
to appeal to both super-angels and VCs.  If you don't seem like you
have the potential to go public, you won't be able to use VCs to
drive up the valuation of an angel round.<br><br>There is a danger of having VCs in an angel round: the so-called
signalling risk.  If VCs are only doing it in the hope of investing
more later, what happens if they don't?  That's a signal to everyone
else that they think you're lame.<br><br>How much should you worry about that?  The seriousness of signalling
risk depends on how far along you are.  If by the next time you
need to raise money, you have graphs showing rising revenue or
traffic month after month, you don't have to worry about any signals
your existing investors are sending.  Your results will speak for
themselves.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Whereas if the next time you need to raise money you won't yet have
concrete results, you may need to think more about the message your
investors might send if they don't invest more.  I'm not sure yet
how much you have to worry, because this whole phenomenon of VCs
doing angel investments is so new. But my instincts tell me you
don't have to worry much.  Signalling risk smells like one of those
things founders worry about that's not a real problem.  As a rule,
the only thing that can kill a good startup is the startup itself.
Startups hurt themselves way more often than competitors hurt them,
for example.  I suspect signalling risk is in this category too.<br><br>One thing YC-funded startups have been doing to mitigate the risk
of taking money from VCs in angel rounds is not to take too much
from any one VC.  Maybe that will help, if you have the luxury of
turning down money.<br><br>Fortunately, more and more startups will.  After decades of competition
that could best be described as intramural, the startup funding
business is finally getting some real competition.  That should
last several years at least, and maybe a lot longer. Unless there's
some huge market crash, the next couple years are going to be a
good time for startups to raise money.  And that's exciting because
it means lots more startups will happen.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I've also heard them called "Mini-VCs" and "Micro-VCs." I
don't know which name will stick.<br><br>There were a couple predecessors.  Ron Conway had angel funds
starting in the 1990s, and in some ways First Round Capital is closer to a
super-angel than a VC fund.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
It wouldn't cut their overall returns tenfold, because investing
later would probably (a) cause them to lose less on investments
that failed, and (b) not allow them to get as large a percentage
of startups as they do now.  So it's hard to predict precisely what
would happen to their returns.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The brand of an investor derives mostly from the success of
their portfolio companies.  The top VCs thus have a big brand
advantage over the super-angels.  They could make it self-perpetuating
if they used it to get all the best new startups.  But I don't think
they'll be able to.  To get all the best startups, you have to do
more than make them want you.  You also have to want them; you have
to recognize them when you see them, and that's much harder.
Super-angels will snap up stars that VCs miss.  And that will cause
the brand gap between the top VCs and the super-angels gradually
to erode.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Though in a traditional series A round VCs put two partners
on your board, there are signs now that VCs may begin to conserve
board seats by switching to what used to be considered an angel-round
board, consisting of two founders and one VC.  Which is also to the
founders' advantage if it means they still control the company.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
In a series A round, you usually have to give up more than
the actual amount of stock the VCs buy, because they insist you
dilute yourselves to set aside an "option pool" as well.  I predict
this practice will gradually disappear though.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
The best thing for founders, if they can get it, is a convertible
note with no valuation cap at all.  In that case the money invested
in the angel round just converts into stock at the valuation of the
next round, no matter how large.  Angels and super-angels tend not
to like uncapped notes. They have no idea how much of the company
they're buying.  If the company does well and the valuation of the
next round is high, they may end up with only a sliver of it.  So
by agreeing to uncapped notes, VCs who don't care about valuations
in angel rounds can make offers that super-angels hate to match.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Obviously signalling risk is also not a problem if you'll
never need to raise more money.  But startups are often mistaken
about that.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, John Bautista, Patrick Collison, James

<p>
October 2010
</p></font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
<i>(I wrote this for Forbes, who asked me to write something
about the qualities we look for in founders.  In print they had to cut
the last item because they didn't have room.)</i><br><br><b>1. Determination</b><br><br>This has turned out to be the most important quality in startup
founders.  We thought when we started Y Combinator that the most
important quality would be intelligence.  That's the myth in the
Valley. And certainly you don't want founders to be stupid.  But
as long as you're over a certain threshold of intelligence, what
matters most is determination.  You're going to hit a lot of
obstacles.  You can't be the sort of person who gets <a href="die.html">demoralized</a>
easily.<br><br>Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman of <a href="http://wepay.com">WePay</a> 
are a good example.  They're
doing a finance startup, which means endless negotiations with big,
bureaucratic companies.  When you're starting a startup that depends
on deals with big companies to exist, it often feels like they're
trying to ignore you out of existence.  But when Bill Clerico starts
calling you, you may as well do what he asks, because he is not
going away.<br><br>
<b>2. Flexibility</b><br><br>You do not however want the sort of determination implied by phrases
like "don't give up on your dreams."  The world of startups is so
unpredictable that you need to be able to modify your dreams on the
fly.  The best metaphor I've found for the combination of determination
and flexibility you need is a <a href="relres.html">running back</a>.  
He's determined to get
downfield, but at any given moment he may need to go sideways or
even backwards to get there.<br><br>The current record holder for flexibility may be Daniel Gross of
<a href="http://greplin.com">Greplin</a>.  He applied to YC with 
some bad ecommerce idea.  We told
him we'd fund him if he did something else.  He thought for a second,
and said ok.  He then went through two more ideas before settling
on Greplin.  He'd only been working on it for a couple days when
he presented to investors at Demo Day, but he got a lot of interest.
He always seems to land on his feet.<br><br>
<b>3. Imagination</b><br><br>Intelligence does matter a lot of course.  It seems like the type
that matters most is imagination.  It's not so important to be able
to solve predefined problems quickly as to be able to come up with
surprising new ideas.  In the startup world, most good ideas 
<a href="googles.html">seem
bad</a> initially.  If they were obviously good, someone would already
be doing them.  So you need the kind of intelligence that produces
ideas with just the right level of craziness.<br><br><a href="http://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a> is that kind of idea.  
In fact, when we funded Airbnb, we
thought it was too crazy.  We couldn't believe large numbers of
people would want to stay in other people's places.  We funded them
because we liked the founders so much.  As soon as we heard they'd
been supporting themselves by selling Obama and McCain branded
breakfast cereal, they were in.  And it turned out the idea was on
the right side of crazy after all.<br><br>
<b>4. Naughtiness</b><br><br>Though the most successful founders are usually good people, they
tend to have a piratical gleam in their eye.  They're not Goody
Two-Shoes type good.  Morally, they care about getting the big
questions right, but not about observing proprieties.  That's why
I'd use the word naughty rather than evil.  They delight in 
<a href="gba.html">breaking
rules</a>, but not rules that matter.  This quality may be redundant
though; it may be implied by imagination.<br><br>Sam Altman of <a href="http://loopt.com">Loopt</a> 
is one of the most successful alumni, so we
asked him what question we could put on the Y Combinator application
that would help us discover more people like him.  He said to ask
about a time when they'd hacked something to their advantage—hacked in the sense of beating the system, not breaking into
computers.  It has become one of the questions we pay most attention
to when judging applications.<br><br>
<b>5. Friendship</b><br><br>Empirically it seems to be hard to start a startup with just 
<a href="startupmistakes.html">one
founder</a>.  Most of the big successes have two or three.  And the
relationship between the founders has to be strong.  They must
genuinely like one another, and work well together.  Startups do
to the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock:
if it can be pulled apart, it will be.<br><br>Emmett Shear and Justin Kan of <a href="http://justin.tv">Justin.tv</a> 
are a good example of close
friends who work well together.  They've known each other since
second grade.  They can practically read one another's minds.  I'm
sure they argue, like all founders, but I have never once sensed
any unresolved tension between them.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston and Chris Steiner for reading drafts of this.<br><br></font></p></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

term for iPhones, iPads, and the corresponding things running
Android.  The closest to a general term seems to be "mobile devices,"
but that (a) applies to any mobile phone, and (b) doesn't really
capture what's distinctive about the iPad.<br><br>After a few seconds it struck me that what we'll end up calling
these things is tablets.  The only reason we even consider calling
them "mobile devices" is that the iPhone preceded the iPad.  If the
iPad had come first, we wouldn't think of the iPhone as a phone;
we'd think of it as a tablet small enough to hold up to your ear.<br><br>The iPhone isn't so much a phone as a replacement for a phone.
That's an important distinction, because it's an early instance of
what will become a common pattern.  Many if not most of the
special-purpose objects around us are going to be replaced by apps
running on tablets.<br><br>This is already clear in cases like GPSes, music players, and
cameras.  But I think it will surprise people how many things are
going to get replaced.  We funded one startup that's 
<a href="http://lockitron.com/">replacing keys</a>.
The fact that you can change font sizes easily means the iPad
effectively replaces reading glasses.  I wouldn't be surprised if
by playing some clever tricks with the accelerometer you could even
replace the bathroom scale.<br><br>The advantages of doing things in software on a single device are
so great that everything that can get turned into software will.
So for the next couple years, a good <a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs8.html">recipe for startups</a>
will be to look around you for things that people haven't realized
yet can be made unnecessary by a tablet app.<br><br>In 1938 Buckminster Fuller coined the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeralization">ephemeralization</a> to
describe the increasing tendency of physical machinery to be replaced
by what we would now call software.  The reason tablets are going
to take over the world is not (just) that Steve Jobs and Co are
industrial design wizards, but because they have this force behind
them.  The iPhone and the iPad have effectively drilled a hole that
will allow ephemeralization to flow into a lot of new areas.  No one
who has studied the history of technology would want to underestimate
the power of that force.<br><br>I worry about the power Apple could have with this force behind
them.  I don't want to see another era of client monoculture like
the Microsoft one in the 80s and 90s.  But if ephemeralization is
one of the main forces driving the spread of tablets, that suggests
a way to compete with Apple: be a better platform for it.<br><br>It has turned out to be a great thing that Apple tablets have
accelerometers in them.  Developers have used the accelerometer in
ways Apple could never have imagined.  That's the nature of platforms.
The more versatile the tool, the less you can predict how people
will use it.  So tablet makers should be thinking: what else can
we put in there?  Not merely hardware, but software too.  What else
can we give developers access to?  Give hackers an inch and they'll
take you a mile.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, and
Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.<br><br><!-- <b>Note:</b> The original version of this essay used the term
"etherealization" instead of "ephemeralization," but apparently
the former was an alternative name suggested to Fuller by 
someone else; he preferred the latter. --><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
December 2010<br><br>Someone we funded is talking to VCs now, and asked me how common
it was for a startup's founders to retain control of the board after
a series A round.  He said VCs told him this almost never happened.<br><br>Ten years ago that was true.  In the past, founders rarely kept
control of the board through a series A.  The traditional series A
board consisted of two founders, two VCs, and one independent member.
More recently the recipe is often one founder, one VC, and one
independent.  In either case the founders lose their majority.<br><br>But not always.  Mark Zuckerberg kept control of Facebook's board
through the series A and still has it today.  Mark Pincus has kept
control of Zynga's too.  But are these just outliers?  How common
is it for founders to keep control after an A round?  I'd heard of
several cases among the companies we've funded, but I wasn't sure
how many there were, so I emailed the ycfounders list.<br><br>The replies surprised me.  In a dozen companies we've funded, the
founders still had a majority of the board seats after the series
A round.<br><br>I feel like we're at a tipping point here.  A lot of VCs still act
as if founders retaining board control after a series A is unheard-of.
A lot of them try to make you feel bad if you even ask — as if
you're a noob or a control freak for wanting such a thing.  But the
founders I heard from aren't noobs or control freaks.  Or if they
are, they are, like Mark Zuckerberg, the kind of noobs and control
freaks VCs should be trying to fund more of.<br><br>Founders retaining control after a series A is clearly heard-of.
And barring financial catastrophe, I think in the coming year it
will become the norm.<br><br>Control of a company is a more complicated matter than simply
outvoting other parties in board meetings.  Investors usually get
vetos over certain big decisions, like selling the company, regardless
of how many board seats they have.  And board votes are rarely
split.  Matters are decided in the discussion preceding the vote,
not in the vote itself, which is usually unanimous.  But if opinion
is divided in such discussions, the side that knows it would lose
in a vote will tend to be less insistent.  That's what board control
means in practice.  You don't simply get to do whatever you want;
the board still has to act in the interest of the shareholders; but
if you have a majority of board seats, then your opinion about
what's in the interest of the shareholders will tend to prevail.<br><br>So while board control is not total control, it's not imaginary
either.  There's inevitably a difference in how things feel within
the company.  Which means if it becomes the norm for founders to
retain board control after a series A, that will change the way
things feel in the whole startup world.<br><br>The switch to the new norm may be surprisingly fast, because the
startups that can retain control tend to be the best ones.  They're
the ones that set the trends, both for other startups and for VCs.<br><br>A lot of the reason VCs are harsh when negotiating with startups
is that they're embarrassed to go back to their partners looking
like they got beaten.  When they sign a termsheet, they want to be
able to brag about the good terms they got.  A lot of them don't
care that much personally about whether founders keep board control.
They just don't want to seem like they had to make concessions.
Which means if letting the founders keep control stops being perceived
as a concession, it will rapidly become much more common.<br><br>Like a lot of changes that have been forced on VCs, this change
won't turn out to be as big a problem as they might think. VCs will
still be able to convince; they just won't be able to compel.  And
the startups where they have to resort to compulsion are not the
ones that matter anyway.  VCs make most of their money from a few
big hits, and those aren't them.<br><br>Knowing that founders will keep control of the board may even help
VCs pick better.  If they know they can't fire the founders, they'll
have to choose founders they can trust.  And that's who they should
have been choosing all along.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, John Bautista, Trevor Blackwell, Paul

<a href="http://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>.   VCs miss good startups all the time, but it's extraordinarily
rare for one to talk about it publicly till long afterward.  So
that post is further evidence what a rare bird Fred is.  He's
probably the nicest VC I know.<br><br>Reading Fred's post made me go back and look at the emails I exchanged
with him at the time, trying to convince him to invest in Airbnb.
It was quite interesting to read.  You can see Fred's mind at work 
as he circles the deal.<br><br>Fred and the Airbnb founders have generously agreed to let me publish
this email exchange (with one sentence redacted about something
that's strategically important to Airbnb and not an important part
of the conversation).  It's an interesting illustration of an element
of the startup ecosystem that few except the participants ever see:
investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio
companies.  Hundreds if not thousands of conversations of this type
are happening now, but if one has ever been published, I haven't
seen it.  The Airbnbs themselves never even saw these emails at the
time.<br><br>We do a lot of this behind the scenes stuff at YC, because we invest
in such a large number of companies, and we invest so early that
investors sometimes need a lot of convincing to see their merits.
I don't always try as hard as this though.  Fred must 
have found me quite annoying.<br><br><br><br>

problem without waiting for the government.<br><br>I've never been 100% sure whether patents help or hinder technological
progress.  When I was a kid I thought they helped.  I thought they
protected inventors from having their ideas stolen by big companies.
Maybe that was truer in the past, when more things were physical.
But regardless of whether patents are in general a good thing, there
do seem to be bad ways of using them.  And since bad uses of patents
seem to be increasing, there is an increasing call for patent reform.<br><br>The problem with patent reform is that it has to go through the
government.  That tends to be slow.  But recently I realized we can
also attack the problem downstream.  As well as pinching off the
stream of patents at the point where they're issued, we may in some
cases be able to pinch it off at the point where they're used.<br><br>One way of using patents that clearly does not encourage innovation
is when established companies with bad products use patents to
suppress small competitors with good products.  This is the type
of abuse we may be able to decrease without having to go through
the government.<br><br>The way to do it is to get the companies that are above pulling
this sort of trick to pledge publicly not to.  Then the ones that
won't make such a pledge will be very conspicuous.  Potential
employees won't want to work for them.  And investors, too, will
be able to see that they're the sort of company that competes by
litigation rather than by making good products.<br><br>Here's the pledge:
<blockquote>
    No first use of software patents against companies with less 
    than 25 people.
</blockquote>
I've deliberately traded precision for brevity.  The patent pledge
is not legally binding.  It's like Google's "Don't be evil." They
don't define what evil is, but by publicly saying that, they're
saying they're willing to be held to a standard that, say, Altria
is not.  And though constraining, "Don't be evil" has been good for
Google. Technology companies win by attracting the most productive
people, and the most productive people are attracted to employers
who hold themselves to a higher standard than the law requires.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The patent pledge is in effect a narrower but open source "Don't
be evil."  I encourage every technology company to adopt it.  If
you want to help fix patents, encourage your employer to.<br><br>Already most technology companies wouldn't sink to using patents
on startups.  You don't see Google or Facebook suing startups for
patent infringement. They don't need to.  So for the better technology
companies, the patent pledge requires no change in behavior.  They're
just promising to do what they'd do anyway.  And when all the
companies that won't use patents on startups have said so, the
holdouts will be very conspicuous.<br><br>The patent pledge doesn't fix every problem with patents.  It won't
stop patent trolls, for example; they're already pariahs.  But the
problem the patent pledge does fix may be more serious than the
problem of patent trolls.  Patent trolls are just parasites.  A
clumsy parasite may occasionally kill the host, but that's not its
goal.  Whereas companies that sue startups for patent infringement
generally do it with explicit goal of keeping their product off the
market.<br><br>Companies that use patents on startups are attacking innovation at
the root.  Now there's something any individual can do about this
problem, without waiting for the government: ask companies where
they stand.<br><br><br><br>
<a href="http://thepatentpledge.org">Patent Pledge Site</a><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes:</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Because the pledge is deliberately vague, we're going to need
common sense when intepreting it.  And even more vice versa: the
pledge is vague in order to make people use common sense when
interpreting it.<br><br>So for example I've deliberately avoided saying whether the 25
people have to be employees, or whether contractors count too.  If
a company has to split hairs that fine about whether a suit would
violate the patent pledge, it's probably still a dick move.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://k9ventures.com/blog/2011/04/27/modista/">The Investment That Didn't Happen</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
October 2011<br><br>If you look at a list of US cities sorted by population, the number
of successful startups per capita varies by orders of magnitude.
Somehow it's as if most places were sprayed with startupicide.<br><br>I wondered about this for years.  I could see the average town was
like a roach motel for startup ambitions: smart, ambitious people
went in, but no startups came out.  But I was never able to figure
out exactly what happened inside the motel—exactly what was
killing all the potential startups.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>A couple weeks ago I finally figured it out. I was framing the
question wrong.  The problem is not that most towns kill startups.
It's that death is the <a href="die.html">default</a> for startups,
and most towns don't save them.  Instead of thinking of most places
as being sprayed with startupicide, it's more accurate to think of
startups as all being poisoned, and a few places being sprayed with
the antidote.<br><br>Startups in other places are just doing what startups naturally do:
fail.  The real question is, what's <i>saving</i> startups in places
like Silicon Valley?
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Environment</b><br><br>I think there are two components to the antidote: being in a place
where startups are the cool thing to do, and chance meetings with
people who can help you.  And what drives them both is the number
of startup people around you.<br><br>The first component is particularly helpful in the first stage of
a startup's life, when you go from merely having an interest in
starting a company to actually doing it.  It's quite a leap to start
a startup.  It's an unusual thing to do. But in Silicon Valley it
seems normal.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>In most places, if you start a startup, people treat you as if
you're unemployed.  People in the Valley aren't automatically
impressed with you just because you're starting a company, but they
pay attention.  Anyone who's been here any amount of time knows not
to default to skepticism, no matter how inexperienced you seem or
how unpromising your idea sounds at first, because they've all seen
inexperienced founders with unpromising sounding ideas who a few
years later were billionaires.<br><br>Having people around you care about what you're doing is an
extraordinarily <a href="cities.html">powerful</a> force.  Even the
most willful people are susceptible to it.  About a year after we
started Y Combinator I said something to a partner at a well known
VC firm that gave him the (mistaken) impression I was considering
starting another startup.  He responded so eagerly that for about
half a second I found myself considering doing it.<br><br>In most other cities, the prospect of starting a startup just doesn't
seem real.  In the Valley it's not only real but fashionable.  That
no doubt causes a lot of people to start startups who shouldn't.
But I think that's ok.  Few people are suited to running a startup,
and it's very hard to predict beforehand which are (as I know all
too well from being in the business of trying to predict beforehand),
so lots of people starting startups who shouldn't is probably the
optimal state of affairs.  As long as you're at a point in your
life when you can bear the risk of failure, the best way to find
out if you're suited to running a startup is to <a href="notnot.html">try
it</a>.<br><br><b>Chance</b><br><br>The second component of the antidote is chance meetings with people
who can help you.  This force works in both phases: both in the
transition from the desire to start a startup to starting one, and
the transition from starting a company to succeeding.  The power
of chance meetings is more variable than people around you caring
about startups, which is like a sort of background radiation that
affects everyone equally, but at its strongest it is far stronger.<br><br>Chance meetings produce miracles to compensate for the disasters
that characteristically befall startups.  In the Valley, terrible
things happen to startups all the time, just like they do to startups
everywhere.  The reason startups are more likely to make it here
is that great things happen to them too.  In the Valley, lightning
has a sign bit.<br><br>For example, you start a site for college students and you decide
to move to the Valley for the summer to work on it.  And then on a
random suburban street in Palo Alto you happen to run into Sean
Parker, who understands the domain really well because he started
a similar startup himself, and also knows all the investors.  And
moreover has advanced views, for 2004, on founders retaining <a href="control.html">control</a> of their companies.<br><br>You can't say precisely what the miracle will be, or even for sure
that one will happen.  The best one can say is: if you're in a
startup hub, unexpected good things will probably happen to you,
especially if you deserve them.<br><br>I bet this is true even for startups we fund.  Even with us working
to make things happen for them on purpose rather than by accident,
the frequency of helpful chance meetings in the Valley is so high
that it's still a significant increment on what we can deliver.<br><br>Chance meetings play a role like the role relaxation plays in having
ideas.  Most people have had the experience of working hard on some
problem, not being able to solve it, giving up and going to bed,
and then thinking of the answer in the shower in the morning.  What
makes the answer appear is letting your thoughts <a href="top.html">drift</a> a bit—and thus drift off the wrong
path you'd been pursuing last night and onto the right one adjacent
to it.<br><br>Chance meetings let your acquaintance drift in the same way taking
a shower lets your thoughts drift. The critical thing in both cases
is that they drift just the right amount.  The meeting between Larry
Page and Sergey Brin was a good example.  They let their acquaintance
drift, but only a little; they were both meeting someone they had
a lot in common with.<br><br>For Larry Page the most important component of the antidote was
Sergey Brin, and vice versa.  The antidote is 
<a href="siliconvalley.html">people</a>.  It's not the
physical infrastructure of Silicon Valley that makes it work, or
the weather, or anything like that.  Those helped get it started,
but now that the reaction is self-sustaining what drives it is the
people.<br><br>Many observers have noticed that one of the most distinctive things
about startup hubs is the degree to which people help one another
out, with no expectation of getting anything in return.  I'm not
sure why this is so.  Perhaps it's because startups are less of a
zero sum game than most types of business; they are rarely killed
by competitors.  Or perhaps it's because so many startup founders
have backgrounds in the sciences, where collaboration is encouraged.<br><br>A large part of YC's function is to accelerate that process.  We're
a sort of Valley within the Valley, where the density of people
working on startups and their willingness to help one another are
both artificially amplified.<br><br><b>Numbers</b><br><br>Both components of the antidote—an environment that encourages
startups, and chance meetings with people who help you—are
driven by the same underlying cause: the number of startup people
around you.  To make a startup hub, you need a <i>lot</i> of people
interested in startups.<br><br>There are three reasons. The first, obviously, is that if you don't
have enough density, the chance meetings don't happen.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
The second is that different startups need such different things, so
you need a lot of people to supply each startup with what they need
most.  Sean Parker was exactly what Facebook needed in 2004.  Another
startup might have needed a database guy, or someone with connections
in the movie business.<br><br>This is one of the reasons we fund such a large number of companies,
incidentally.  The bigger the community, the greater the chance it
will contain the person who has that one thing you need most.<br><br>The third reason you need a lot of people to make a startup hub is
that once you have enough people interested in the same problem,
they start to set the social norms.  And it is a particularly
valuable thing when the atmosphere around you encourages you to do
something that would otherwise seem too ambitious.  In most places
the atmosphere pulls you back toward the mean.<br><br>I flew into the Bay Area a few days ago.  I notice this every time
I fly over the Valley: somehow you can sense something is going on.  
Obviously you can sense prosperity in how well kept a
place looks.  But there are different kinds of prosperity.  Silicon
Valley doesn't look like Boston, or New York, or LA, or DC.  I tried
asking myself what word I'd use to describe the feeling the Valley
radiated, and the word that came to mind was optimism.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I'm not saying it's impossible to succeed in a city with few
other startups, just harder.  If you're sufficiently good at
generating your own morale, you can survive without external
encouragement.  Wufoo was based in Tampa and they succeeded.  But
the Wufoos are exceptionally disciplined.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Incidentally, this phenomenon is not limited to startups.  Most
unusual ambitions fail, unless the person who has them manages to
find the right sort of community.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Starting a company is common, but starting a startup is rare.
I've talked about the distinction between the two elsewhere, but
essentially a startup is a new business designed for scale.  Most
new businesses are service businesses and except in rare cases those
don't scale.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
As I was writing this, I had a demonstration of the density of
startup people in the Valley.  Jessica and I bicycled to University
Ave in Palo Alto to have lunch at the fabulous Oren's Hummus.  As
we walked in, we met Charlie Cheever sitting near the door.  Selina
Tobaccowala stopped to say hello on her way out.  Then Josh Wilson
came in to pick up a take out order.  After lunch we went to get
frozen yogurt.  On the way we met Rajat Suri.  When we got to the
yogurt place, we found Dave Shen there, and as we walked out we ran
into Yuri Sagalov.  We walked with him for a block or so and we ran
into Muzzammil Zaveri, and then a block later we met Aydin Senkut.
This is everyday life in Palo Alto.  I wasn't trying to meet people;
I was just having lunch.  And I'm sure for every startup founder
or investor I saw that I knew, there were 5 more I didn't.  If Ron
Conway had been with us he would have met 30 people he knew.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, and

I took a <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb">snapshot of Viaweb's
site</a>.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.<br><br>The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens
were a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage
used to just fit in the size window people typically used then.<br><br>Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts
and they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that
looked good, you had to render display text as images.<br><br>You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> logos.  We did that
as an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red
circle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how
few other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized
<a href="zero.html">why</a>.<br><br>On the <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/com.html">Company
page</a> you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.
Robert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm">Worm</a> that he
didn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree
to a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has
since <a href="http://ycombinator.com/people.html">relaxed</a> a bit
on that point.<br><br>Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the
course of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire
PhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases
was one <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/trevor.html">celebrating
his graduation</a>, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during
a meeting.<br><br>(Trevor also appears as <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/tlbwebdesign.html">Trevino
Bagwell</a> in our directory of web designers merchants could hire
to build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some
competitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo
would deter any actual customers, but it did not.)<br><br>Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines
and newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online
that there are today.  So we used to pay a <a href="submarine.html">PR
firm</a> $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately
reporters <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/presquot.html">liked
us</a>.<br><br>In our <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/se.html">advice about
getting traffic from search engines</a> (I don't think the term SEO
had been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,
AltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice
anything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.<br><br>We supported online transactions via a company called 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberCash,_Inc.">Cybercash</a>,
since if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product
comparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes
were so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/cybercash.html">talk merchants
out of doing real time authorizations</a>.<br><br>The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the
<a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/tesdriv.html">test drive</a>.
It was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put
cgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our
software worked.<br><br>We had some <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/us.html">well
known users</a>.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the
most traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,
so it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.
I once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,
and it was about $300/month.<br><br>Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just
over 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what
at the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)
coming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even
colocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things
went wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or
more precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique
privilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to
share it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed
the Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his
stack of window air conditioners could keep up.<br><br>For describing pages, we had a template language called <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/rtml.html">RTML</a>, which
supposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after
Rtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,
and concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it
had syntax.<br><br>Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have
versions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so
we made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made
the version number <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/rel4.html">an
integer</a>.  That "version 4.0" icon was generated by our own
button generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made
with our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because
we wanted to experience what our users did.<br><br>At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search
engine called <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/shoprel.html">Shopfind</a>.  It
was pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler
that could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out
the products.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
January 2012<br><br>There are great startup ideas lying around unexploited right under
our noses.  One reason we don't see them is a phenomenon I call
<i>schlep blindness</i>.  Schlep was originally a Yiddish word but has
passed into general use in the US.  It means a tedious, unpleasant
task.<br><br>No one likes schleps, but hackers especially dislike them.  
Most hackers who start startups wish they could do it by just writing
some clever software, putting it on a server somewhere, and watching
the money roll in—without ever having to talk to users, or negotiate
with other companies, or deal with other people's broken code.
Maybe that's possible, but I haven't seen it.<br><br>One of the many things we do at Y Combinator is teach hackers about
the inevitability of schleps.  No, you can't start a startup by
just writing code.  I remember going through this realization myself.
There was a point in 1995 when I was still trying to convince myself
I could start a company by just writing code.  But I soon learned
from experience that schleps are not merely inevitable, but pretty
much what business consists of.  A company is defined by the schleps
it will undertake.  And schleps should be dealt with the same way
you'd deal with a cold swimming pool: just jump in.  Which is not
to say you should seek out unpleasant work per se, but that you
should never shrink from it if it's on the path to something great.<br><br>The most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps is that much
of it is unconscious.  Your unconscious won't even let you see ideas
that involve painful schleps.  That's schlep blindness.<br><br>The phenomenon isn't limited to startups.  Most people don't
consciously decide not to be in as good physical shape as Olympic
athletes, for example.  Their unconscious mind decides for them,
shrinking from the work involved.<br><br>The most striking example I know of schlep blindness is 
<a href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, or
rather Stripe's idea.  For over a decade, every hacker who'd ever
had to process payments online knew how painful the experience was.
Thousands of people must have known about this problem.  And yet
when they started startups, they decided to build recipe sites, or
aggregators for local events.  Why?  Why work on problems few care
much about and no one will pay for, when you could fix one of the
most important components of the world's infrastructure?  Because
schlep blindness prevented people from even considering the idea
of fixing payments.<br><br>Probably no one who applied to Y Combinator to work on a recipe
site began by asking "should we fix payments, or build a recipe
site?" and chose the recipe site.  Though the idea of fixing payments
was right there in plain sight, they never saw it, because their
unconscious mind shrank from the complications involved.  You'd
have to make deals with banks.  How do you do that?  Plus you're
moving money, so you're going to have to deal with fraud, and people
trying to break into your servers.  Plus there are probably all
sorts of regulations to comply with.  It's a lot more intimidating
to start a startup like this than a recipe site.<br><br>That scariness makes ambitious ideas doubly valuable.  In addition
to their intrinsic value, they're like undervalued stocks in the
sense that there's less demand for them among founders.  If you
pick an ambitious idea, you'll have less competition, because
everyone else will have been frightened off by the challenges
involved.  (This is also true of starting a startup generally.)<br><br>How do you overcome schlep blindness?  Frankly, the most valuable
antidote to schlep blindness is probably ignorance.  Most successful
founders would probably say that if they'd known when they were
starting their company about the obstacles they'd have to overcome,
they might never have started it.  Maybe that's one reason the most
successful startups of all so often have young founders.<br><br>In practice the founders grow with the problems.  But no one seems
able to foresee that, not even older, more experienced founders.
So the reason younger founders have an advantage is that they make
two mistakes that cancel each other out.  They don't know how much
they can grow, but they also don't know how much they'll need to.
Older founders only make the first mistake.<br><br>Ignorance can't solve everything though.  Some ideas so obviously
entail alarming schleps that anyone can see them.  How do you see
ideas like that?  The trick I recommend is to take yourself out of
the picture.  Instead of asking "what problem should I solve?" ask
"what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?"  If someone
who had to process payments before Stripe had tried asking that,
Stripe would have been one of the first things they wished for.<br><br>It's too late now to be Stripe, but there's plenty still broken in
the world, if you know how to see it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison,

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
January 2012<br><br>A year ago I noticed a pattern in the least successful startups
we'd funded: they all seemed hard to talk to.  It felt as if there
was some kind of wall between us.  I could never quite tell if they
understood what I was saying.<br><br>This caught my attention because earlier we'd noticed a pattern
among the most successful startups, and it seemed to hinge on a
different quality.  We found the startups that did best were the
ones with the sort of founders about whom we'd say "they can take
care of themselves."  The startups that do best are fire-and-forget
in the sense that all you have to do is give them a lead, and they'll
close it, whatever type of lead it is.  When they're raising money,
for example, you can do the initial intros knowing that if you
wanted to you could stop thinking about it at that point.  You won't
have to babysit the round to make sure it happens.  That type of
founder is going to come back with the money; the only question is
how much on what terms.<br><br>It seemed odd that the outliers at the two ends of the spectrum
could be detected by what appeared to be unrelated tests.  You'd
expect that if the founders at one end were distinguished by the
presence of quality x, at the other end they'd be distinguished by
lack of x.  Was there some kind of inverse relation between
<a href="relres.html">resourcefulness</a> and being hard to talk to?<br><br>It turns out there is, and the key to the mystery is the old adage
"a word to the wise is sufficient."   Because this phrase is not
only overused, but overused in an indirect way (by prepending the
subject to some advice), most people who've heard it don't know
what it means.  What it means is that if someone is wise, all you
have to do is say one word to them, and they'll understand immediately.
You don't have to explain in detail; they'll chase down all the
implications.<br><br>In much the same way that all you have to do is give the right sort
of founder a one line intro to a VC, and he'll chase down the money.
That's the connection.  Understanding all the implications — even the
inconvenient implications — of what someone tells you is a subset of
resourcefulness.  It's conversational resourcefulness.<br><br>Like real world resourcefulness, conversational resourcefulness
often means doing things you don't want to.  Chasing down all the
implications of what's said to you can sometimes lead to uncomfortable
conclusions.  The best word to describe the failure to do so is
probably "denial," though that seems a bit too narrow.  A better
way to describe the situation would be to say that the unsuccessful
founders had the sort of conservatism that comes from weakness.
They traversed idea space as gingerly as a very old person
traverses the physical world.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The unsuccessful founders weren't stupid.  Intellectually they
were as capable as
the successful founders of following all the implications of what
one said to them.  They just weren't eager to.<br><br>So being hard to talk to was not what was killing the
unsuccessful startups.  It
was a sign of an underlying lack of resourcefulness.  That's what
was killing them.  As well as
failing to chase down the implications of what was said to them,
the unsuccessful founders would also fail to chase down funding,
and users, and sources of new ideas.  But the most immediate evidence
I had that something was amiss was that I couldn't talk to them.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]

creates a rationalization for doing so. They may not even be conscious

<p>
March 2012<br><br>One of the more surprising things I've noticed while working
on Y Combinator is how frightening the most ambitious startup
ideas are.  In this essay I'm going to demonstrate
this phenomenon by describing some.  Any one of them
could make you a billionaire.  That might sound like an attractive
prospect, and yet when I describe these ideas you may
notice you find yourself shrinking away from them.<br><br>Don't worry, it's not a sign of weakness.  Arguably it's a sign of
sanity.  The biggest startup ideas are terrifying.  And not just
because they'd be a lot of work.  The biggest ideas seem to threaten
your identity: you wonder if you'd have enough ambition to carry
them through.<br><br>There's a scene in <i>Being John Malkovich</i> where the nerdy hero
encounters a very attractive, sophisticated woman.  She says to
him:
</p><blockquote>
  Here's the thing: If you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue
  what to do with me.
</blockquote>
That's what these ideas say to us.<br><br>This phenomenon is one of the most important things you can understand
about startups.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
You'd expect big startup ideas to be
attractive, but actually they tend to repel you.  And that has a
bunch of consequences.  It means these ideas are invisible to most
people who try to think of startup ideas, because their subconscious
filters them out.  Even the most ambitious people are probably best
off approaching them obliquely.<br><br><b>1. A New Search Engine</b><br><br>The best ideas are just on the right side of impossible.  I don't
know if this one is possible, but there are signs it might be.
Making a new search engine means competing with Google, and recently
I've noticed some cracks in their fortress.<br><br>The point when it became clear to me that Microsoft had lost their
way was when they decided to get into the search business.  That
was not a natural move for Microsoft.  They did it because they
were afraid of Google, and Google was in the search business.  But
this meant (a) Google was now setting Microsoft's agenda, and (b)
Microsoft's agenda consisted of stuff they weren't good at.<br><br>Microsoft : Google :: Google : Facebook.<br><br>That does not by itself mean
there's room for a new search engine, but lately when using Google
search I've found myself nostalgic for the old days, when
Google was true to its own slightly aspy self.  Google used to give
me a page of the right answers, fast, with no clutter.  Now the
results seem inspired by the Scientologist principle that what's
true is what's true for you.  And the pages don't have the
clean, sparse feel they used to.  Google search results used to
look like the output of a Unix utility.  Now if I accidentally put
the cursor in the wrong place, anything might happen.<br><br>The way to win here is to build the search engine all the hackers
use.  A search engine whose users consisted of the top 10,000 hackers
and no one else would be in a very powerful position despite its
small size, just as Google was when it was that search engine.  And
for the first time in over a decade the idea of switching seems
thinkable to me.<br><br>Since anyone capable of starting this company is one of those 10,000
hackers, the route is at least straightforward: make the search
engine you yourself want.  Feel free to make it excessively hackerish.
Make it really good for code search, for example.  Would you like
search queries to be Turing complete?  Anything that gets you those
10,000 users is ipso facto good.<br><br>Don't worry if something you want to do will constrain you in the
long term, because if you don't get that initial core of users,
there won't be a long term.  If you can just build something that
you and your friends genuinely prefer to Google, you're already
about 10% of the way to an IPO, just as Facebook was (though they
probably didn't realize it) when they got all the Harvard undergrads.<br><br><b>2. Replace Email</b><br><br>Email was not designed to be used the way we use it now.  Email is
not a messaging protocol.  It's a todo list.  Or rather, my inbox
is a todo list, and email is the way things get onto it.  But it
is a disastrously bad todo list.<br><br>I'm open to different types of solutions to this problem, but I
suspect that tweaking the inbox is not enough, and that email has
to be replaced with a new protocol. 
This new protocol should be a todo list protocol, not
a messaging protocol, although there is a degenerate case where
what someone wants you to do is: read the following text.<br><br>As a todo list protocol, the new protocol should give more power
to the recipient than email does.  I want there to be more restrictions
on what someone can put on my todo list.  And when someone can put
something on my todo list, I want them to tell me more about what
they want from me.  Do they want me to do something beyond just
reading some text?  How important is it?  (There obviously has to
be some mechanism to prevent people from saying everything is
important.)  When does it have to be done?<br><br>This is one of those ideas that's like an irresistible force meeting
an immovable object.  On one hand, entrenched protocols are impossible
to replace.  On the other, it seems unlikely that people in
100 years will still be living in the same email hell we do now.
And if email is going to get replaced eventually, why not now?<br><br>If you do it right, you may be able to avoid the usual chicken 
and egg problem new protocols face, because some of the most powerful
people in the world will be among the first to switch to it.  
They're all at the mercy of email too.<br><br>Whatever you build, make it fast.  GMail has become painfully slow.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
If you made something no better than GMail, but fast, that
alone would let you start to pull users away from GMail.<br><br>GMail is slow because Google can't afford to spend a lot on it.
But people will pay for this.  I'd have no problem paying $50 a month.
Considering how much time I spend in email, it's kind of scary to
think how much I'd be justified in paying.  At least $1000 a month.
If I spend several hours a day reading and writing email, that would
be a cheap way to make my life better.<br><br><b>3. Replace Universities</b><br><br>People are all over this idea lately, and I think they're onto
something.  I'm reluctant to suggest that an institution that's
been around for a millennium is finished just because of some mistakes
they made in the last few decades, but certainly in the last few
decades US universities seem to have been headed down the wrong
path.  One could do a lot better for a lot less money.<br><br>I don't think universities will disappear.  They won't be replaced
wholesale.  They'll just lose the de facto monopoly on certain types
of learning that they once had.  There will be many different ways
to learn different things, and some may look quite different from
universities.   Y Combinator itself is arguably one of them.<br><br>Learning is such a big problem that changing the way people do it
will have a wave of secondary effects.  For example, the name of
the university one went to is treated by a lot of people (correctly
or not) as a credential in its own right.  If learning breaks up
into many little pieces, credentialling may separate from it.  There
may even need to be replacements for campus social life (and oddly
enough, YC even has aspects of that).<br><br>You could replace high schools too, but there you face bureaucratic
obstacles that would slow down a startup.  Universities seem the
place to start.<br><br><b>4. Internet Drama</b><br><br>Hollywood has been slow to embrace the Internet.  That was a 
mistake, because I think we can now call a winner in the race between
delivery mechanisms, and it is the Internet, not cable.<br><br>A lot of the reason is the horribleness of cable clients, also known
as TVs.  Our family didn't wait for Apple TV.  We hated our last
TV so much that a few months ago we replaced it with an iMac bolted
to the wall.  It's a little inconvenient to control it with a
wireless mouse, but the overall experience is much better than the
nightmare UI we had to deal with before.<br><br>Some of the attention people currently devote to watching
movies and TV can be stolen by things that seem completely unrelated,
like social networking apps.  More can be stolen by things that are
a little more closely related, like games.  But there will probably
always remain some residual demand for conventional drama, where
you sit passively and watch as a plot happens.  So how do you deliver
drama via the Internet?  Whatever you make will have to be on a
larger scale than Youtube clips.  When people sit down to watch a
show, they want to know what they're going to get: either part
of a series with familiar characters, or a single longer "movie"
whose basic premise they know in advance.<br><br>There are two ways delivery and payment could play out.  Either
some company like Netflix or Apple will be the app store for
entertainment, and you'll reach audiences through them.  Or the
would-be app stores will be too overreaching, or too technically
inflexible, and companies will arise to supply payment and streaming
a la carte to the producers of drama.  If that's the way things
play out, there will also be a need for such infrastructure companies.<br><br><b>5. The Next Steve Jobs</b><br><br>I was talking recently to someone who knew Apple well, and I asked
him if the people now running the company would be able to keep
creating new things the way Apple had under Steve Jobs.  His answer
was simply "no."  I already feared that would be the answer.  I
asked more to see how he'd qualify it.  But he didn't qualify it
at all.  No, there will be no more great new stuff beyond whatever's
currently in the pipeline.  Apple's
revenues may continue to rise for a long time, but as Microsoft
shows, revenue is a lagging indicator in the technology business.<br><br>So if Apple's not going to make the next iPad, who is?  None of the
existing players.  None of them are run by product visionaries, and
empirically you can't seem to get those by hiring them.  Empirically
the way you get a product visionary as CEO is for him to found the
company and not get fired.  So the company that creates the next
wave of hardware is probably going to have to be a startup.<br><br>I realize it sounds preposterously ambitious for a startup to try
to become as big as Apple.  But no more ambitious than it was for
Apple to become as big as Apple, and they did it.  Plus a startup
taking on this problem now has an advantage the original Apple
didn't: the example of Apple.  Steve Jobs has shown us what's
possible.  That helps would-be successors both directly, as Roger
Bannister did, by showing how much better you can do than people
did before, and indirectly, as Augustus did, by lodging the idea
in users' minds that a single person could unroll the future 
for them. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Now Steve is gone there's a vacuum we can all feel.  If a new company
led boldly into the future of hardware, users would follow.  The
CEO of that company, the "next Steve Jobs," might not measure up
to Steve Jobs. But he wouldn't have to.  He'd just have to do a
better job than Samsung and HP and Nokia, and that seems pretty
doable.<br><br><b>6. Bring Back Moore's Law</b><br><br>The last 10 years have reminded us what Moore's Law actually says.
Till about 2002 you could safely misinterpret it as promising that
clock speeds would double every 18 months.  Actually what it says
is that circuit densities will double every 18 months.  It used to
seem pedantic to point that out.  Not any more.  Intel can no longer
give us faster CPUs, just more of them.<br><br>This Moore's Law is not as good as the old one.  Moore's Law used
to mean that if your software was slow, all you had to do was wait,
and the inexorable progress of hardware would solve your problems.
Now if your software is slow you have to rewrite it to do more
things in parallel, which is a lot more work than waiting.<br><br>It would be great if a startup could give us something of the old
Moore's Law back, by writing software that could make a large number
of CPUs look to the developer like one very fast CPU.  There are
several ways to approach this problem.  The most ambitious is to
try to do it automatically: to write a compiler that will parallelize
our code for us.  There's a name for this compiler, <i>the sufficiently
smart compiler,</i> and it is a byword for impossibility.  But is
it really impossible?  Is there no configuration of the bits in
memory of a present day computer that is this compiler?  If you
really think so, you should try to prove it, because that would be
an interesting result.  And if it's not impossible but simply very
hard, it might be worth trying to write it.  The expected value
would be high even if the chance of succeeding was low.<br><br>The reason the expected value is so high is web services.  If you
could write software that gave programmers the convenience of the
way things were in the old days, you could offer it to them as a
web service.  And that would in turn mean that you got practically
all the users.<br><br>Imagine there was another processor manufacturer that could still translate
increased circuit densities into increased clock speeds. They'd
take most of Intel's business.  And since web services mean that
no one sees their processors anymore, by writing the sufficiently
smart compiler you could create a situation indistinguishable from
you being that manufacturer, at least for the server market.<br><br>The least ambitious way of approaching the problem is to start from
the other end, and offer programmers more parallelizable Lego blocks
to build programs out of, like Hadoop and MapReduce.   Then the
programmer still does much of the work of optimization.<br><br>There's an intriguing middle ground where you build a semi-automatic
weapon—where there's a human in the loop.  You make something
that looks to the user like the sufficiently smart compiler, but
inside has people, using highly developed optimization tools to
find and eliminate bottlenecks in users' programs.   These people
might be your employees, or you might create a marketplace for
optimization.<br><br>An optimization marketplace would be a way to generate the sufficiently
smart compiler piecemeal, because participants would immediately
start writing bots.  It would be a curious state of affairs if you
could get to the point where everything could be done by bots,
because then you'd have made the sufficiently smart compiler, but
no one person would have a complete copy of it.<br><br>I realize how crazy all this sounds.  In fact, what I like about
this idea is all the different ways in which it's wrong.  The whole
idea of focusing on optimization is counter to the general trend
in software development for the last several decades.  Trying to
write the sufficiently smart compiler is by definition a mistake.
And even if it weren't, compilers are the sort of software that's
supposed to be created by open source projects, not companies.  Plus
if this works it will deprive all the programmers who take pleasure
in making multithreaded apps of so much amusing complexity. The
forum troll I have by now internalized doesn't even know where to
begin in raising objections to this project.  Now that's what I
call a startup idea.<br><br><b>7. Ongoing Diagnosis</b><br><br>But wait, here's another that could face even greater resistance:
ongoing, automatic medical diagnosis.<br><br>One of my tricks for generating startup ideas is to imagine the
ways in which we'll seem backward to future generations.  And I'm
pretty sure that to people 50 or 100 years in the future, it will
seem barbaric that people in our era waited till they had symptoms
to be diagnosed with conditions like heart disease and cancer.<br><br>For example, in 2004 Bill Clinton found he was feeling short of
breath.  Doctors discovered that several of his arteries were over
90% blocked and 3 days later he had a quadruple bypass.  It seems
reasonable to assume Bill Clinton has the best medical care available.
And yet even he had to wait till his arteries were over 90% blocked
to learn that the number was over 90%.  Surely at some point in the
future we'll know these numbers the way we now know something like
our weight.  Ditto for cancer.  It will seem preposterous to future
generations that we wait till patients have physical symptoms to
be diagnosed with cancer.  Cancer will show up on some sort of radar
screen immediately.<br><br>(Of course, what shows up on the radar screen may be different from
what we think of now as cancer.  I wouldn't be surprised if at any
given time we have ten or even hundreds of microcancers going at
once, none of which normally amount to anything.)<br><br>A lot of the obstacles to ongoing diagnosis will come from the fact
that it's going against the grain of the medical profession.  The
way medicine has always worked is that patients come to doctors
with problems, and the doctors figure out what's wrong.  A lot of
doctors don't like the idea of going on the medical equivalent of
what lawyers call a "fishing expedition," where you go looking for
problems without knowing what you're looking for.  They call the
things that get discovered this way "incidentalomas," and they are
something of a nuisance.<br><br>For example, a friend of mine once had her brain scanned as part
of a study.  She was horrified when the doctors running the study
discovered what appeared to be a large tumor.  After further testing,
it turned out to be a harmless cyst.  But it cost her a few days
of terror. A lot of doctors worry that if you start scanning people
with no symptoms, you'll get this on a giant scale: a huge number
of false alarms that make patients panic and require expensive and
perhaps even dangerous tests to resolve.  But I think that's just
an artifact of current limitations.  If people were scanned all the
time and we got better at deciding what was a real problem, my
friend would have known about this cyst her whole life and known
it was harmless, just as we do a birthmark.<br><br>There is room for a lot of startups here.  
In addition to the technical obstacles all
startups face, and the bureaucratic obstacles all medical startups
face, they'll be going against thousands of years of medical
tradition.  But it will happen, and it will be a great thing—so
great that people in the future will feel as sorry for us as we do
for the generations that lived before anaesthesia and antibiotics.<br><br><b>Tactics</b><br><br>Let me conclude with some tactical advice.  If you want to take on
a problem as big as the ones I've discussed, don't make a direct
frontal attack on it.  Don't say, for example, that you're going
to replace email.  If you do that you raise too many expectations.
Your employees and investors will constantly be asking "are we there
yet?" and you'll have an army of haters waiting to see you fail.
Just say you're building todo-list software.  That sounds harmless.
People can notice you've replaced email when it's a <i>fait accompli</i>.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Empirically, the way to do really big things seems to be to start
with deceptively small things.  Want to dominate microcomputer
software?  Start by writing a Basic interpreter for a machine with
a few thousand users.  Want to make the universal web site?  Start
by building a site for Harvard undergrads to stalk one another.<br><br>Empirically, it's not just for other people that you need to start
small.  You need to for your own sake.  Neither Bill Gates nor Mark
Zuckerberg knew at first how big their companies were going to get.
All they knew was that they were onto something.  Maybe it's a bad
idea to have really big ambitions initially, because the bigger
your ambition, the longer it's going to take, and the further you
project into the future, the more likely you'll get it wrong.<br><br>I think the way to use these big ideas is not to try to identify a
precise point in the future and then ask yourself how to get from
here to there, like the popular image of a visionary.  You'll be
better off if you operate like Columbus and just head in a general
westerly direction.  Don't try to construct the future like a
building, because your current blueprint is almost certainly mistaken.
Start with something you know works, and when you expand, expand
westward.<br><br>The popular image of the visionary is someone with a clear view of
the future, but empirically it may be better to have a blurry one.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
It's also one of the most important things VCs fail to
understand about startups.  Most expect founders to walk in with a
clear plan for the future, and judge them based on that.  Few
consciously realize that in the biggest successes there is the least
correlation between the initial plan and what the startup eventually
becomes.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]

Roger Bannister is famous as the first person to run a mile
in under 4 minutes.  But his world record only lasted 46 days.  Once
he showed it could be done, lots of others followed.  Ten years
later Jim Ryun ran a 3:59 mile as a high school junior.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
If you want to be the next Apple, maybe you don't even want to start
with consumer electronics.  Maybe at first you make something hackers
use.  Or you make something popular but apparently unimportant,
like a headset or router.  All you need is a bridgehead.<br><br>

century Japan called Ooka Tadasuke.  One of the cases he decided
was brought by the owner of a food shop.  A poor student who could
afford only rice was eating his rice while enjoying the delicious
cooking smells coming from the food shop.  The owner wanted the
student to pay for the smells he was enjoying.<br><br>The student was
stealing his smells!<br><br>This story often comes to mind when I hear the RIAA and MPAA accusing
people of stealing music and movies.<br><br>It sounds ridiculous to us to treat smells as property.  But I can
imagine scenarios in which one could charge for smells.  Imagine
we were living on a moon base where we had to buy air by the
liter.  I could imagine air suppliers adding scents at an extra
charge.<br><br>The reason it seems ridiculous to us to treat smells as property
is that it wouldn't work to.  It would work on a moon base, though.<br><br>What counts as property depends on what works to treat as property.
And that not only can change, but has changed.  Humans may always
(for some definition of human and always) have treated small items
carried on one's person as property.  But hunter gatherers didn't
treat land, for example, as property in the way we do.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The reason so many people think of property as having a single
unchanging definition is that its definition changes very slowly.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
But we are in the midst of such a change now.  The record
labels and movie studios used to distribute what they made like air
shipped through tubes on a moon base.  But with the arrival of
networks, it's as if we've moved to a planet with a breathable
atmosphere.  Data moves like smells now.  And through a combination
of wishful thinking and short-term greed, the labels and studios
have put themselves in the position of the food shop owner, accusing
us all of stealing their smells.<br><br>(The reason I say short-term greed is that the underlying problem
with the labels and studios is that the people who run them are
driven by bonuses rather than equity.  If they were driven by equity
they'd be looking for ways to take advantage of technological change
instead of fighting it.  But building new things takes too long.
Their bonuses depend on this year's revenues, and the best way to
increase those is to extract more money from stuff they do already.)<br><br>So what does this mean?  Should people not be able to charge for
content?  There's not a single yes or no answer to that question.
People should be able to charge for content when it works to charge
for content.<br><br>But by "works" I mean something more subtle than "when they can get
away with it."  I mean when people can charge for content without
warping society in order to do it.  After all, the companies selling
smells on the moon base could continue to sell them on the Earth,
if they lobbied successfully for laws requiring us all to continue
to breathe through tubes down here too, even though we no longer
needed to.<br><br>The crazy legal measures that the labels and studios have been
taking have a lot of that flavor.  Newspapers and magazines are
just as screwed, but they are at least declining gracefully.  The
RIAA and MPAA would make us breathe through tubes if they could.<br><br>Ultimately it comes down to common sense.  When you're abusing the
legal system by trying to use mass lawsuits against randomly chosen
people as a form of exemplary punishment, or lobbying for laws
that would break the Internet if they passed, that's ipso facto
evidence you're using a definition of property that doesn't work.<br><br>This is where it's helpful to have working democracies and multiple
sovereign countries.  If the world had a single, autocratic government,
the labels and studios could buy laws making the definition of
property be whatever they wanted.  But fortunately there are still
some countries that are not copyright colonies of the US, and even
in the US, <a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/congress-on-sopa-done.png">politicians</a>
still seem to be afraid of actual voters, in sufficient numbers.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The people running the US may not like it when voters or other
countries refuse to bend to their will, but ultimately it's in all
our interest that there's not a single point of attack for people
trying to warp the law to serve their own purposes.  Private property
is an extremely useful idea — arguably one of our greatest inventions.
So far, each new definition of it has brought us increasing material
wealth.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
It seems reasonable to suppose the newest one will
too.  It would be a disaster if we all had to keep running an
obsolete version just because a few powerful people were too lazy
to upgrade.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
If you want to learn more about hunter gatherers I strongly
recommend Elizabeth Marshall Thomas's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harmless-People-Elizabeth-Marshall-Thomas/dp/0394427793"><i>The
Harmless People</i></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Old-Way-Story-First-People/dp/0374225524"><i>The
Old Way</i></a>.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Change in the definition of property is driven mostly by
technological progress, however, and since technological progress
is accelerating, so presumably will the rate of change in the
definition of property.  Which means it's all the more important
for societies to be able to respond gracefully to such changes,
because they will come at an ever increasing rate.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
As far as I know, the term "copyright colony" was first used
by <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/australia-us-copyright-colony-or-just-a-good-friend-120121/">Myles
Peterson</a>.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
The state of technology isn't simply a function of
the definition of property.  They each constrain the other.  But
that being so, you can't mess with the definition of property without
affecting (and probably harming) the state of technology.  The
history of the USSR offers a vivid illustration of that.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts

As usual we were so
busy we didn't notice till a few days after.  I don't think we've
ever managed to remember our birthday on our birthday.
<p>
On March 11 2005, Jessica and I were walking home from dinner in
Harvard Square.  Jessica was working at an investment bank at the
time, but she didn't like it much, so she had interviewed for a job
as director of marketing at a Boston VC fund.  The VC fund was doing
what now seems a comically familiar thing for a VC fund to do:
taking a long time to make up their mind.  Meanwhile I had been
telling Jessica all the things they should change about the VC
business � essentially the ideas now underlying Y&nbsp;Combinator:
investors
should be making more, smaller investments, they should be funding
hackers instead of suits, they should be willing to fund younger
founders, etc.
</p><p>
At the time I had been thinking about doing some angel investing.  I
had just given a talk to the undergraduate computer club at Harvard
about
<a href="start.html"><font color="#000099">how to start a
startup</font></a>, and it
hit me afterward that although I had always
meant to do angel investing, 7 years had now passed since I got
enough money to do it, and I still hadn't started.  I had also
been thinking about ways to work with Robert Morris and Trevor
Blackwell again.  A few hours before I had
sent them an email trying to figure out what we could do together.
</p><p>
Between Harvard Square and my house the idea gelled.  We'd start
our own investment firm and Jessica could work for that instead.
As we turned onto Walker Street we decided to do it.  I agreed to
put $100k into the new fund and Jessica agreed to quit her job to
work for it.  Over the next couple days I recruited Robert
and Trevor, who put in another $50k each.  So YC
started with $200k.
</p><p>
Jessica was so happy to be able to quit her job and start her own
company that I took her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609055553/http://www.ycombinator.com/yc05.html">picture</a>
 when we got home.
</p><p>
The company wasn't called Y Combinator yet. At first we called it
Cambridge Seed.  But that name never saw the light of day, because
by the time we announced it a few days later, we'd changed the name
to Y Combinator.  We realized early on that what we were doing could
be national in scope and we didn't want a name that tied us to one
place.
</p><p>
Initially we only had part of the idea. We were going to do
seed funding with standardized terms.  Before YC, seed funding was
very haphazard. You'd get that first $10k from your friend's rich
uncle. The deal terms were often a disaster; often neither the
investor nor the founders nor the lawyer knew what the documents
should look like.  Facebook's early history as a Florida LLC shows
how random things could be in those days.  We were going to be
something there had not been before: a standard source of seed
funding.
</p><p>
We modelled YC on the seed funding we ourselves had taken
when we started Viaweb.  We started Viaweb with $10k we got from
our friend <a href="julian.html"><font color="#000099">Julian Weber</font></a>,
the husband of Idelle Weber, whose
painting class I took as a grad student at Harvard.  Julian knew
about business, but you would not describe him as a suit.  Among
other things he'd been president of the <i>National Lampoon</i>.  He was
also a lawyer, and got all our paperwork set up properly.  In return
for $10k, getting us set up as a company, teaching us what
business was about, and remaining calm in times of crisis, Julian
got 10% of Viaweb.  I remember thinking once what a good deal
Julian got.  And then a second later I realized that without
Julian, Viaweb would never have made it.  So even though it was a
good deal for him, it was a good deal for us too.  That's why I
knew there was room for something like Y Combinator.
</p><p>
Initially we didn't have what turned out to be the most important
idea: funding startups synchronously, instead of asynchronously as
it had always been done before.  Or rather we had the idea, but we
didn't realize its significance.  We decided very early 
that the first thing we'd do would
be to fund a bunch of startups over the coming summer.  But we
didn't realize initially that this would be the way we'd do all our
investing.  The reason we began by funding a bunch of startups at
once was not that we thought it would be a better way to fund
startups, but simply because we wanted to learn how to be angel
investors, and a summer program for undergrads seemed the fastest
way to do it.  No one takes summer jobs that seriously.  The
opportunity cost for a bunch of undergrads to spend a summer working
on startups was low enough that we wouldn't feel guilty encouraging
them to do it.
</p><p>
We knew students would already be making plans for the summer, so
we did what we're always telling startups to do: we launched fast.
Here are the
initial <a href="summerfounder.html"><font color="#000099">announcement</font></a>
and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609055553/http://ycombinator.com/old/sfp.html">description</a> of what
was at the time called the Summer Founders Program.
</p><p>
We got lucky in that the length and structure of a summer program
turns out to be perfect for what we do.
The structure of the YC cycle is still almost identical to what
it was that first summer.
</p><p>
We also got lucky in who the first batch of founders were.  We never
expected to make any money from that first batch.  We thought of
the money we were investing as a combination of an educational expense
and a charitable donation.  But the
founders in the first batch turned out to be surprisingly good.
And great people too.  We're still friends with a lot of them today.
</p><p>
It's hard for people to realize now how inconsequential YC seemed at the
time.  I can't blame people who didn't take us seriously, because
we ourselves didn't take that first summer program seriously in the
very beginning.  But as the summer progressed we were increasingly
impressed by how well the startups were doing.  Other people started
to be impressed too.  Jessica and I invented a term, "the Y Combinator
effect," to describe the moment when the realization hit someone
that YC was not totally lame.  When people came to YC to speak
at the dinners that first summer, they came in the spirit of someone
coming to address a Boy Scout troop.  By the time they left the
building they were all saying some variant of "Wow, these
companies might actually succeed."
</p><p>
Now YC is well enough known that people are no longer surprised
when the companies we fund are legit, but it took a
while for reputation to catch up with reality.  That's one of the
reasons we especially like funding ideas that might be dismissed
as "toys" � because YC itself was dismissed as one initially.
</p><p>
When we saw how well it worked to fund companies synchronously,
we decided we'd keep doing that.  We'd fund two batches of
startups a year.
</p><p>
We funded the second batch in Silicon Valley.  That was
a last minute decision.  In retrospect I think what pushed me over
the edge was going to Foo Camp that fall.  The density of startup
people in the Bay Area was so much greater than in Boston, and the
weather was so nice.  I remembered that from living there in the
90s.  Plus I didn't want someone else to copy us and describe it
as the Y Combinator of Silicon Valley.  I wanted YC to be the Y&nbsp;Combinator 
of Silicon Valley.  So doing the winter batch in California
seemed like one of those rare cases where the self-indulgent choice
and the ambitious one were the same.
</p></font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
If we'd had enough time to do what we wanted, Y Combinator would
have been in Berkeley.  That was our favorite part of the Bay Area.
But we didn't have time to get a building in Berkeley.  We didn't
have time to get our own building anywhere. The only way to get
enough space in time was to convince Trevor to let us take over
part of his (as it then seemed) giant building in Mountain View.
Yet again we lucked out, because Mountain View turned out to be the
ideal place to put something like YC.  But even then we barely made
it.  The first dinner in California, we had to warn all the founders
not to touch the walls, because the paint was still wet.<br><br></font></p></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><div><div><div></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></div><div><br><br><div><h1 id="speak">Writing and Speaking</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">March 2012<br><br>I'm not a very good speaker.  I say "um" a lot. Sometimes I have
to pause when I lose my train of thought.  I wish I were a better
speaker.  But I don't wish I were a better speaker like I wish I
were a better writer.  What I really want is to have good ideas,
and that's a much bigger part of being a good writer than being a
good speaker.<br><br>Having good ideas is most of writing well.  If you know what you're
talking about, you can say it in the plainest words and you'll be
perceived as having a good style.  With speaking it's the opposite:
having good ideas is an alarmingly small component of being a good
speaker.<br><br>I first noticed this at a conference several years ago.
There was another speaker who was much better than me.
He had all of us roaring with laughter.  I seemed awkward and
halting by comparison.  Afterward I put my talk online like I usually
do.  As I was doing it I tried to imagine what a transcript of the
other guy's talk would be like, and it was only then I realized he
hadn't said very much.<br><br>Maybe this would have been obvious to someone who knew more about
speaking, but it was a revelation to me how much less ideas mattered
in speaking than writing.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>A few years later I heard a talk by someone who was not merely a
better speaker than me, but a famous speaker.  Boy was he good.  So
I decided I'd pay close attention to what he said, to learn how he
did it.  After about ten sentences I found myself thinking "I don't
want to be a good speaker."<br><br>Being a really good speaker is not merely orthogonal to having good ideas,
but in many ways pushes you in the opposite direction.  For example,
when I give a talk, I usually write it out beforehand.  I know that's
a mistake; I know delivering a 
<nota href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc">prewritten 
talk makes it harder to
engage with an audience.  The way to get the attention of an audience
is to give them <i>your</i> full attention, and when you're delivering
a prewritten talk, your attention is always divided between the
audience and the talk — even if you've memorized it.  If you want
to engage an audience, it's better to start with no more than an outline
of what you want to say and 
<nota href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmG9jzCHtSQ">ad lib the individual sentences.  But
if you do that, you might spend no more time thinking about each
sentence than it takes to say it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Occasionally the stimulation
of talking to a live audience makes you think of new things, but
in general this is not going to generate ideas as well as writing
does, where you can spend as long on each sentence as you want.<br><br>If you rehearse a prewritten speech enough, you can get
asymptotically close to the sort of engagement you get when speaking
ad lib.  Actors do.  But here again there's a tradeoff between
smoothness and ideas.  All the time you spend practicing a talk,
you could instead spend making it better.  Actors don't face
that temptation, except in the rare cases where they've written the
script, but any speaker does.  Before I give a talk I can usually
be found sitting in a corner somewhere with a copy printed out on
paper, trying to rehearse it in my head.  But I always end up
spending most of the time rewriting it instead.  Every talk I give
ends up being given from a manuscript full of things crossed out
and rewritten.  Which of course makes me um even more, because I
haven't had any time to practice the new bits.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Depending on your audience, there are even worse tradeoffs than
these.  Audiences like to be flattered; they like jokes; they like
to be swept off their feet by a vigorous stream of words.  As you
decrease the intelligence of the audience, being a good speaker is
increasingly a matter of being a good bullshitter.  That's true in
writing too of course, but the descent is steeper with talks.  Any
given person is dumber as a member of an audience than as a reader.
Just as a speaker ad libbing can only spend as long thinking about
each sentence as it takes to say it, a person hearing a talk can
only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to hear
it.  Plus people in an audience are always affected by the reactions
of those around them, and the reactions that spread from person to
person in an audience are disproportionately the more brutish sort,
just as low notes travel through walls better than high ones.  Every
audience is an incipient mob, and a good speaker uses that.  Part
of the reason I laughed so much at the talk by the good speaker at
that conference was that everyone else did.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>So are talks useless?  They're certainly inferior to the written
word as a source of ideas.  But that's not all talks are good for.
When I go to a talk, it's usually because I'm interested in the
speaker.  Listening to a talk is the closest most of us can get to
having a conversation with someone like the president, who doesn't
have time to meet individually with all the people who want to meet
him.<br><br>Talks are also good at motivating me to do things.  It's probably
no coincidence that so many famous speakers are described as
motivational speakers.  That may be what public speaking is really
for.  It's probably what it was originally for.  The emotional
reactions you can elicit with a talk can be a powerful force.
I wish I could say that this force was more often used for good than
ill, but I'm not sure.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I'm not talking here about academic talks, which are a 
different type of thing.  While the
audience at an academic talk might appreciate a joke, they will (or
at least should) make a conscious effort to see what new ideas
you're presenting.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
That's the lower bound.  In practice you can often do better,
because talks are usually about things you've written or talked
about before, and when you ad lib, you end up reproducing some of
those sentences.  Like early medieval architecture, impromptu talks
are made of spolia.  Which feels a bit dishonest, incidentally,
because you have to deliver these sentences as if you'd just thought
of them.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Robert Morris points out that there is a way in which practicing
talks makes them better: reading a talk out loud can expose awkward
parts.  I agree and in fact I read most things I write out loud at
least once for that reason.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
For sufficiently small audiences, it may not be true that being
part of an audience makes people dumber.  The real decline seems
to set in when the audience gets too big for the talk to feel like
a conversation — maybe around 10 people.<br><br>

biggest <a href="http://bronnieware.com/regrets-of-the-dying/">regrets
of the dying</a>.  Her list seems plausible.  I could see
myself — <i>can</i> see myself — making at least 4 of these
5 mistakes.<br><br>If you had to compress them into a single piece of advice, it might
be: don't be a cog.  The 5 regrets paint a portrait of post-industrial
man, who shrinks himself into a shape that fits his circumstances,
then turns dutifully till he stops.<br><br>The alarming thing is, the mistakes that produce these regrets are
all errors of omission.  You forget your dreams, ignore your family,
suppress your feelings, neglect your friends, and forget to be
happy.  Errors of omission are a particularly dangerous type of
mistake, because you make them by default.<br><br>I would like to avoid making these mistakes.  But how do you avoid
mistakes you make by default?  Ideally you transform your life so
it has other defaults.  But it may not be possible to do that
completely. As long as these mistakes happen by default, you probably
have to be reminded not to make them.  So I inverted the 5 regrets,
yielding a list of 5 commands
<blockquote>
   Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you
   think; cultivate friendships; be happy.

September 2012<br><br>I've done several types of work over the years but I don't know
another as counterintuitive as startup investing.<br><br>The two most important things to understand about startup investing,
as a business, are (1) that effectively all the returns are
concentrated in a few big winners, and (2) that the best ideas look
initially like bad ideas.<br><br>The first rule I knew intellectually, but didn't really grasp till
it happened to us.  The total value of the companies we've funded
is around 10 billion, give or take a few.  But just two companies,
Dropbox and Airbnb, account for about three quarters of it.<br><br>In startups, the big winners are big to a degree that violates our
expectations about variation.  I don't know whether these expectations
are innate or learned, but whatever the cause, we are just not
prepared for the 1000x variation in outcomes that one finds in
startup investing.<br><br>That yields all sorts of strange consequences.  For example, in
purely financial terms, there is probably at most one company in
each YC batch that will have a significant effect on our returns,
and the rest are just a cost of doing business.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
I haven't
really assimilated that fact, partly because it's so counterintuitive,
and partly because we're not doing this just for financial reasons;
YC would be a pretty lonely place if we only had one company per
batch.  And yet it's true.<br><br>To succeed in a domain that violates your intuitions, you need to
be able to turn them off the way a pilot does when flying through
clouds. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
  You need to do what you know intellectually to be
right, even though it feels wrong.<br><br>It's a constant battle for us.  It's hard to make ourselves take
enough risks. When you interview a startup and think "they seem
likely to succeed," it's hard not to fund them.  And yet, financially
at least, there is only one kind of success: they're either going
to be one of the really big winners or not, and if not it doesn't
matter whether you fund them, because even if they succeed the
effect on your returns will be insignificant.  In the same day of
interviews you might meet some smart 19 year olds who aren't even
sure what they want to work on. Their chances of succeeding seem
small.  But again, it's not their chances of succeeding that matter
but their chances of succeeding really big.  The probability that
any group will succeed really big is microscopically small, but the
probability that those 19 year olds will might be higher than that
of the other, safer group.<br><br>The probability that a startup will make it big is not simply a
constant fraction of the probability that they will succeed at all.
If it were, you could fund everyone who seemed likely to succeed
at all, and you'd get that fraction of big hits.  Unfortunately
picking winners is harder than that.  You have to ignore the elephant
in front of you, the likelihood they'll succeed, and focus instead
on the separate and almost invisibly intangible question of whether
they'll succeed really big.<br><br><b>Harder</b><br><br>That's made harder by the fact that the best startup ideas seem at
first like bad ideas.  I've written about this before: if a good
idea were obviously good, someone else would already have done it.
So the most successful founders tend to work on ideas that few
beside them realize are good.  Which is not that far from a description
of insanity, till you reach the point where you see results.<br><br>The first time Peter Thiel spoke at YC he drew a Venn diagram that
illustrates the situation perfectly.  He drew two intersecting
circles, one labelled "seems like a bad idea" and the other "is a
good idea."  The intersection is the sweet spot for startups.<br><br>This concept is a simple one and yet seeing it as a Venn diagram
is illuminating.  It reminds you that there is an intersection—that
there are good ideas that seem bad.  It also reminds you that the
vast majority of ideas that seem bad are bad.<br><br>The fact that the best ideas seem like bad ideas makes it even
harder to recognize the big winners.  It means the probability of
a startup making it really big is not merely not a constant fraction
of the probability that it will succeed, but that the startups with
a high probability of the former will seem to have a disproportionately
low probability of the latter.<br><br>History tends to get rewritten by big successes, so that in retrospect
it seems obvious they were going to make it big.  For that reason
one of my most valuable memories is how lame Facebook sounded to
me when I first heard about it.  A site for college students to
waste time?  It seemed the perfect bad idea: a site (1) for a niche
market (2) with no money (3) to do something that didn't matter.<br><br>One could have described Microsoft and Apple in exactly the same
terms.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Harder Still</b><br><br>Wait, it gets worse.  You not only have to solve this hard problem,
but you have to do it with no indication of whether you're succeeding.
When you pick a big winner, you won't know it for two years.<br><br>Meanwhile, the one thing you <i>can</i> measure is dangerously
misleading.  The one thing we can track precisely is how well the
startups in each batch do at fundraising after Demo Day.  But we
know that's the wrong metric.  There's no correlation between the
percentage of startups that raise money and the metric that does
matter financially, whether that batch of startups contains a big
winner or not.<br><br>Except an inverse one.  That's the scary thing: fundraising is not
merely a useless metric, but positively misleading.  We're in a
business where we need to pick unpromising-looking outliers, and
the huge scale of the successes means we can afford to spread our
net very widely.  The big winners could generate 10,000x returns.
That means for each big winner we could pick a thousand companies
that returned nothing and still end up 10x ahead.<br><br>If we ever got to the point where 100% of the startups we funded
were able to raise money after Demo Day, it would almost certainly
mean we were being too conservative.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>It takes a conscious effort not to do that too.  After 15 cycles
of preparing startups for investors and then watching how they do,
I can now look at a group we're interviewing through Demo Day
investors' eyes.  But those are the wrong eyes to look through!<br><br>We can afford to take at least 10x as much risk as Demo Day investors.
And since risk is usually proportionate to reward, if you can afford
to take more risk you should.  What would it mean to take 10x more
risk than Demo Day investors?  We'd have to be willing to fund 10x
more startups than they would.  Which means that even if we're
generous to ourselves and assume that YC can on average triple a
startup's expected value, we'd be taking the right amount of risk
if only 30% of the startups were able to raise significant funding
after Demo Day.<br><br>I don't know what fraction of them currently raise more after Demo
Day.  I deliberately avoid calculating that number, because if you
start measuring something you start optimizing it, and I know it's
the wrong thing to optimize.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
But the percentage is certainly
way over 30%.  And frankly the thought of a 30% success rate at
fundraising makes my stomach clench.  A Demo Day where only 30% of
the startups were fundable would be a shambles.  Everyone would
agree that YC had jumped the shark. We ourselves would feel that
YC had jumped the shark.  And yet we'd all be wrong.<br><br>For better or worse that's never going to be more than a thought
experiment.  We could never stand it.  How about that for
counterintuitive?  I can lay out what I know to be the right thing
to do, and still not do it.  I can make up all sorts of plausible
justifications.  It would hurt YC's brand (at least among the
innumerate) if we invested in huge numbers of risky startups that
flamed out.  It might dilute the value of the alumni network.
Perhaps most convincingly, it would be demoralizing for us to be
up to our chins in failure all the time.  But I know the real reason
we're so conservative is that we just haven't assimilated the fact
of 1000x variation in returns.<br><br>We'll probably never be able to bring ourselves to take risks
proportionate to the returns in this business.  The best we can
hope for is that when we interview a group and find ourselves
thinking "they seem like good founders, but what are investors going
to think of this crazy idea?" we'll continue to be able to say "who
cares what investors think?"  That's what we thought about Airbnb,
and if we want to fund more Airbnbs we have to stay good at thinking
it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I'm not saying that the big winners are all that matters, just
that they're all that matters financially for investors.  Since
we're not doing YC mainly for financial reasons, the big winners
aren't all that matters to us.  We're delighted to have funded
Reddit, for example. Even though we made comparatively little from
it, Reddit has had a big effect on the world, and it introduced us
to Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, both of whom have become good
friends.<br><br>Nor do we push founders to try to become one of the big winners if
they don't want to. We didn't "swing for the fences" in our own
startup (Viaweb, which was acquired for $50 million), and it would
feel pretty bogus to press founders to do something we didn't do.
Our rule is that it's up to the founders.  Some want to take over
the world, and some just want that first few million.  But we invest
in so many companies that we don't have to sweat any one outcome.
In fact, we don't have to sweat whether startups have exits at all.
The biggest exits are the only ones that matter financially, and
those are guaranteed in the sense that if a company becomes big
enough, a market for its shares will inevitably arise.  Since the
remaining outcomes don't have a significant effect on returns, it's
cool with us if the founders want to sell early for a small amount,
or grow slowly and never sell (i.e. become a so-called lifestyle
business), or even shut the company down.  We're sometimes disappointed
when a startup we had high hopes for doesn't do well, but this
disappointment is mostly the ordinary variety that anyone feels
when that happens.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Without visual cues (e.g. the horizon) you can't distinguish
between gravity and acceleration.  Which means if you're flying
through clouds you can't tell what the attitude of
the aircraft is.  You could feel like you're flying straight and
level while in fact you're descending in a spiral.  The solution
is to ignore what your body is telling you and listen only to your
instruments.  But it turns out to be very hard to ignore what your
body is telling you.  Every pilot knows about this 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation">problem</a> and yet
it is still a leading cause of accidents.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Not all big hits follow this pattern though. The reason Google
seemed a bad idea was that there were already lots of search engines
and there didn't seem to be room for another.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
A startup's success at fundraising is a function of two things:
what they're selling and how good they are at selling it.  And while
we can teach startups a lot about how to appeal to investors, even
the most convincing pitch can't sell an idea that investors don't
like.  I was genuinely worried that Airbnb, for example, would not
be able to raise money after Demo Day.  I couldn't convince <a href="airbnb.html">Fred Wilson</a> to fund them.  They might not
have raised money at all but for the coincidence that Greg McAdoo,
our contact at Sequoia, was one of a handful of VCs who understood
the vacation rental business, having spent much of the previous two
years investigating it.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
I calculated it once for the last batch before a consortium of
investors started offering investment automatically to every startup
we funded, summer 2010.  At the time it was 94% (33 of 35 companies
that tried to raise money succeeded, and one didn't try because
they were already profitable).  Presumably it's lower now because
of that investment; in the old days it was raise after Demo Day or
die.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, Jessica

<p>
September 2012<br><br>A startup is a company designed to grow fast.  Being newly founded
does not in itself make a company a startup.  Nor is it necessary
for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or
have some sort of "exit."  The only essential thing is growth.
Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.<br><br>If you want to start one it's important to understand that. Startups
are so hard that you can't be pointed off to the side and hope to
succeed.  You have to know that growth is what you're after.  The
good news is, if you get growth, everything else tends to fall into
place.  Which means you can use growth like a compass to make almost
every decision you face.<br><br>
<b>Redwoods</b><br><br>Let's start with a distinction that should be obvious but is often
overlooked: not every newly founded company is a startup.  Millions
of companies are started every year in the US.  Only a tiny fraction
are startups.  Most are service businesses — restaurants, barbershops,
plumbers, and so on.  These are not startups, except in a few unusual
cases.  A barbershop isn't designed to grow fast.  Whereas a search
engine, for example, is.<br><br>When I say startups are designed to grow fast, I mean it in two
senses.  Partly I mean designed in the sense of intended, because
most startups fail.  But I also mean startups are different by
nature, in the same way a redwood seedling has a different destiny
from a bean sprout.<br><br>That difference is why there's a distinct word, "startup," for
companies designed to grow fast.  If all companies were essentially
similar, but some through luck or the efforts of their founders
ended up growing very fast, we wouldn't need a separate word.  We
could just talk about super-successful companies and less successful
ones.  But in fact startups do have a different sort of DNA from
other businesses.  Google is not just a barbershop whose founders
were unusually lucky and hard-working.  Google was different from
the beginning.<br><br>To grow rapidly, you need to make something you can sell to a big
market.  That's the difference between Google and a barbershop.  A
barbershop doesn't scale.<br><br>For a company to grow really big, it must (a) make something lots
of people want, and (b) reach and serve all those people.  Barbershops
are doing fine in the (a) department.  Almost everyone needs their
hair cut.  The problem for a barbershop, as for any retail
establishment, is (b).  A barbershop serves customers in person,
and few will travel far for a haircut.  And even if they did, the
barbershop couldn't accomodate them. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Writing software is a great way to solve (b), but you can still end
up constrained in (a).  If you write software to teach Tibetan to
Hungarian speakers, you'll be able to reach most of the people who
want it, but there won't be many of them.   If you make software
to teach English to Chinese speakers, however, you're in startup
territory.<br><br>Most businesses are tightly constrained in (a) or (b).  The distinctive
feature of successful startups is that they're not.<br><br>
<b>Ideas</b><br><br>It might seem that it would always be better to start a startup
than an ordinary business.  If you're going to start a company, why
not start the type with the most potential?  The catch is that this
is a (fairly) efficient market.   If you write software to teach
Tibetan to Hungarians, you won't have much competition.  If you
write software to teach English to Chinese speakers, you'll face
ferocious competition, precisely because that's such a larger prize.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The constraints that limit ordinary companies also protect them.
That's the tradeoff.  If you start a barbershop, you only have to
compete with other local barbers.  If you start a search engine you
have to compete with the whole world.<br><br>The most important thing that the constraints on a normal business
protect it from is not competition, however, but the difficulty of
coming up with new ideas.  If you open a bar in a particular
neighborhood, as well as limiting your potential and protecting you
from competitors, that geographic constraint also helps define your
company.  Bar + neighborhood is a sufficient idea for a small
business.  Similarly for companies constrained in (a).  Your niche
both protects and defines you.<br><br>Whereas if you want to start a startup, you're probably going to
have to think of something fairly novel.  A startup has to make
something it can deliver to a large market, and ideas of that type
are so valuable that all the obvious ones are already taken.<br><br>That space of ideas has been so thoroughly picked over that a startup
generally has to work on something everyone else has overlooked.
I was going to write that one has to make a conscious effort to
find ideas everyone else has overlooked.  But that's not how most
startups get started.  Usually successful startups happen because
the founders are sufficiently different from other people that ideas
few others can see seem obvious to them.  Perhaps later they step
back and notice they've found an idea in everyone else's blind spot,
and from that point make a deliberate effort to stay there. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
But at the moment when successful startups get started, much of the
innovation is unconscious.<br><br>What's different about successful founders is that they can see
different problems.  It's a particularly good combination both to
be good at technology and to face problems that can be solved by
it, because technology changes so rapidly that formerly bad ideas
often become good without anyone noticing.  Steve Wozniak's problem
was that he wanted his own computer.  That was an unusual problem
to have in 1975.  But technological change was about to make it a
much more common one.  Because he not only wanted a computer but
knew how to build them, Wozniak was able to make himself one.  And
the problem he solved for himself became one that Apple solved for
millions of people in the coming years.  But by the time it was
obvious to ordinary people that this was a big market, Apple was
already established.<br><br>Google has similar origins.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted to
search the web.  But unlike most people they had the technical
expertise both to notice that existing search engines were not as
good as they could be, and to know how to improve them.  Over the
next few years their problem became everyone's problem, as the web
grew to a size where you didn't have to be a picky search expert
to notice the old algorithms weren't good enough.  But as happened
with Apple, by the time everyone else realized how important search
was, Google was entrenched.<br><br>That's one connection between startup ideas and technology.  Rapid
change in one area uncovers big, soluble problems in other areas.
Sometimes the changes are advances, and what they change is solubility.
That was the kind of change that yielded Apple; advances in chip
technology finally let Steve Wozniak design a computer he could
afford.  But in Google's case the most important change was the
growth of the web. What changed there was not solubility but bigness.<br><br>The other connection between startups and technology is that startups
create new ways of doing things, and new ways of doing things are,
in the broader sense of the word, new technology.  
When a startup both begins with an
idea exposed by technological change and makes a product consisting
of technology in the narrower sense (what used to be called "high
technology"), it's easy to conflate the two.  But the two connections
are distinct and in principle one could start a startup that was
neither driven by technological change, nor whose product consisted
of technology except in the broader sense. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Rate</b><br><br>How fast does a company have to grow to be considered a startup?
There's no precise answer to that.  "Startup" is a pole, not a
threshold.  Starting one is at first no more than a declaration of
one's ambitions.  You're committing not just to starting a company,
but to starting a fast growing one, and you're thus committing to
search for one of the rare ideas of that type.  But at first you
have no more than commitment.  Starting a startup is like being an
actor in that respect.  "Actor" too is a pole rather than a threshold.
At the beginning of his career, an actor is a waiter who goes to
auditions.  Getting work makes him a successful actor, but he doesn't
only become an actor when he's successful.<br><br>So the real question is not what growth rate makes a company a
startup, but what growth rate successful startups tend to have.
For founders that's more than a theoretical question, because it's
equivalent to asking if they're on the right path.<br><br>The growth of a successful startup usually has three phases:
</p><ol>
<li> There's an initial period of slow or no growth while the startup
  tries to figure out what it's doing.<br><br></li><li> As the startup figures out how to make something lots of people
  want and how to reach those people, there's a period of rapid
  growth.<br><br></li><li> Eventually a successful startup will grow into a big company.
  Growth will slow, partly due to internal limits and partly because
  the company is starting to bump up against the limits of the
  markets it serves.  
  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
</li></ol>
Together these three phases produce an S-curve.  The phase whose
growth defines the startup is the second one, the ascent.  Its
length and slope determine how big the company will be.<br><br>The slope is the company's growth rate.  If there's one number every
founder should always know, it's the company's growth rate.  That's
the measure of a startup.  If you don't know that number, you don't
even know if you're doing well or badly.<br><br>When I first meet founders and ask what their growth rate is,
sometimes they tell me "we get about a hundred new customers a
month."  That's not a rate.  What matters is not the absolute number
of new customers, but the ratio of new customers to existing ones.
If you're really getting a constant number of new customers every
month, you're in trouble, because that means your growth rate is
decreasing.<br><br>During Y Combinator we measure growth rate per week, partly because
there is so little time before Demo Day, and partly because startups
early on need frequent feedback from their users to tweak what
they're doing. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>A good growth rate during YC is 5-7% a week.  If you can hit 10% a
week you're doing exceptionally well.  If you can only manage 1%,
it's a sign you haven't yet figured out what you're doing.<br><br>The best thing to measure the growth rate of is revenue.  The next
best, for startups that aren't charging initially, is active users.
That's a reasonable proxy for revenue growth because whenever the
startup does start trying to make money, their revenues will probably
be a constant multiple of active users. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Compass</b><br><br>We usually advise startups to pick a growth rate they think they
can hit, and then just try to hit it every week.  The key word here
is "just." If they decide to grow at 7% a week and they hit that
number, they're successful for that week.  There's nothing more
they need to do.  But if they don't hit it, they've failed in the
only thing that mattered, and should be correspondingly alarmed.<br><br>Programmers will recognize what we're doing here.  We're turning
starting a startup into an optimization problem.  And anyone who
has tried optimizing code knows how wonderfully effective that sort
of narrow focus can be.  Optimizing code means taking an existing
program and changing it to use less of something, usually time or
memory.  You don't have to think about what the program should do,
just make it faster.  For most programmers this is very satisfying
work.  The narrow focus makes it a sort of puzzle, and you're
generally surprised how fast you can solve it.<br><br>Focusing on hitting a growth rate reduces the otherwise bewilderingly
multifarious problem of starting a startup to a single problem.
You can use that target growth rate to make all your decisions for
you; anything that gets you the growth you need is ipso facto right.
Should you spend two days at a conference?  Should you hire another
programmer?  Should you focus more on marketing?  Should you spend
time courting some big customer?  Should you add x feature? Whatever
gets you your target growth rate. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>Judging yourself by weekly growth doesn't mean you can look no more
than a week ahead.  Once you experience the pain of missing your
target one week (it was the only thing that mattered, and you failed
at it), you become interested in anything that could spare you such
pain in the future.  So you'll be willing for example to hire another
programmer, who won't contribute to this week's growth but perhaps
in a month will have implemented some new feature that will get you
more users.   But only if (a) the distraction of hiring someone
won't make you miss your numbers in the short term, and (b) you're
sufficiently worried about whether you can keep hitting your numbers
without hiring someone new.<br><br>It's not that you don't think about the future, just that you think
about it no more than necessary.<br><br>In theory this sort of hill-climbing could get a startup into
trouble.  They could end up on a local maximum.  But in practice
that never happens.  Having to hit a growth number every week forces
founders to act, and acting versus not acting is the high bit of
succeeding.  Nine times out of ten, sitting around strategizing is
just a form of procrastination.  Whereas founders' intuitions about
which hill to climb are usually better than they realize.  Plus the
maxima in the space of startup ideas are not spiky and isolated.
Most fairly good ideas are adjacent to even better ones.<br><br>The fascinating thing about optimizing for growth is that it can
actually discover startup ideas.  You can use the need for growth
as a form of evolutionary pressure.  If you start out with some
initial plan and modify it as necessary to keep hitting, say, 10%
weekly growth, you may end up with a quite different company than
you meant to start.  But anything that grows consistently at 10% a
week is almost certainly a better idea than you started with.<br><br>There's a parallel here to small businesses.  Just as the constraint
of being located in a particular neighborhood helps define a bar,
the constraint of growing at a certain rate can help define a
startup.<br><br>You'll generally do best to follow that constraint wherever it leads
rather than being influenced by some initial vision, just as a
scientist is better off following the truth wherever it leads rather
than being influenced by what he wishes were the case.  When Richard
Feynman said that the imagination of nature was greater than the
imagination of man, he meant that if you just keep following the
truth you'll discover cooler things than you could ever have made
up. For startups, growth is a constraint much like truth. Every
successful startup is at least partly a product of the imagination
of growth.

<b>Value</b><br><br>It's hard to find something that grows consistently at several
percent a week, but if you do you may have found something surprisingly
valuable.  If we project forward we see why.<br><br><center>

A company that grows at 1% a week will grow 1.7x a year, whereas a
company that grows at 5% a week will grow 12.6x.  A company making
$1000 a month (a typical number early in YC) and growing at 1% a
week will 4 years later be making $7900 a month, which is less than
a good programmer makes in salary in Silicon Valley.  A startup
that grows at 5% a week will in 4 years be making $25 million a
month. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>Our ancestors must rarely have encountered cases of exponential
growth, because our intuitions are no guide here.  What happens
to fast growing startups tends to surprise even the founders.<br><br>Small variations in growth rate produce qualitatively different
outcomes.  That's why there's a separate word for startups, and why
startups do things that ordinary companies don't, like raising money
and getting acquired.  And, strangely enough, it's also why they
fail so frequently.<br><br>Considering how valuable a successful startup can become, anyone
familiar with the concept of expected value would be surprised if
the failure rate weren't high.  If a successful startup could make
a founder $100 million, then even if the chance of succeeding were
only 1%, the expected value of starting one would be $1 million.
And the probability of a group of sufficiently smart and determined
founders succeeding on that scale might be significantly over 1%.
For the right people — e.g. the young Bill Gates — the probability
might be 20% or even 50%.  So it's not surprising that so many want
to take a shot at it.  In an efficient market, the number of failed
startups should be proportionate to the size of the successes.  And
since the latter is huge the former should be too. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>What this means is that at any given time, the great majority of
startups will be working on something that's never going to go
anywhere, and yet glorifying their doomed efforts with the grandiose
title of "startup."<br><br>This doesn't bother me.  It's the same with other high-beta vocations,
like being an actor or a novelist.  I've long since gotten used to
it.  But it seems to bother a lot of people, particularly those
who've started ordinary businesses.  Many are annoyed that these
so-called startups get all the attention, when hardly any of them
will amount to anything.<br><br>If they stepped back and looked at the whole picture they might be
less indignant.  The mistake they're making is that by basing their
opinions on anecdotal evidence they're implicitly judging by the
median rather than the average.  If you judge by the median startup,
the whole concept of a startup seems like a fraud.  You have to
invent a bubble to explain why founders want to start them or
investors want to fund them.  But it's a mistake to use the median
in a domain with so much variation.  If you look at the average
outcome rather than the median, you can understand why investors
like them, and why, if they aren't median people, it's a rational
choice for founders to start them.<br><br>
<b>Deals</b><br><br>Why do investors like startups so much?  Why are they so hot to
invest in photo-sharing apps, rather than solid money-making
businesses?  Not only for the obvious reason.<br><br>The test of any investment is the ratio of return to risk.  Startups
pass that test because although they're appallingly risky, the
returns when they do succeed are so high.  But that's not the only
reason investors like startups.  An ordinary slower-growing business
might have just as good a ratio of return to risk, if both were
lower.  So why are VCs interested only in high-growth companies?
The reason is that they get paid by getting their capital back,
ideally after the startup IPOs, or failing that when it's acquired.<br><br>The other way to get returns from an investment is in the form of
dividends.  Why isn't there a parallel VC industry that invests in
ordinary companies in return for a percentage of their profits?
Because it's too easy for people who control a private company to
funnel its revenues to themselves (e.g. by buying overpriced
components from a supplier they control) while making it look like
the company is making little profit.  Anyone who invested in private
companies in return for dividends would have to pay close attention
to their books.<br><br>The reason VCs like to invest in startups is not simply the returns,
but also because such investments are so easy to oversee.  The
founders can't enrich themselves without also enriching the investors.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>Why do founders want to take the VCs' money?  Growth, again.  The
constraint between good ideas and growth operates in both directions.
It's not merely that you need a scalable idea to grow.  If you have
such an idea and don't grow fast enough, competitors will.  Growing
too slowly is particularly dangerous in a business with network
effects, which the best startups usually have to some degree.<br><br>Almost every company needs some amount of funding to get started.
But startups often raise money even when they are or could be
profitable.  It might seem foolish to sell stock in a profitable
company for less than you think it will later be worth, but it's
no more foolish than buying insurance.  Fundamentally that's how
the most successful startups view fundraising.  They could grow the
company on its own revenues, but the extra money and help supplied
by VCs will let them grow even faster.  Raising money lets you
<i>choose</i> your growth rate.<br><br>Money to grow faster is always at the command of the most successful
startups, because the VCs need them more than they need the VCs.
A profitable startup could if it wanted just grow on its own revenues.
Growing slower might be slightly dangerous, but chances are it
wouldn't kill them.  Whereas VCs need to invest in startups, and
in particular the most successful startups, or they'll be out of
business.  Which means that any sufficiently promising startup will
be offered money on terms they'd be crazy to refuse.  And yet because
of the scale of the successes in the startup business, VCs can still
make money from such investments.  You'd have to be crazy to believe
your company was going to become as valuable as a high growth rate
can make it, but some do.<br><br>Pretty much every successful startup will get acquisition offers
too.  Why?  What is it about startups that makes other companies
want to buy them? 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>Fundamentally the same thing that makes everyone else want the stock
of successful startups: a rapidly growing company is valuable.  It's
a good thing eBay bought Paypal, for example, because Paypal is now
responsible for 43% of their sales and probably more of their growth.<br><br>But acquirers have an additional reason to want startups.  A rapidly
growing company is not merely valuable, but dangerous.  If it keeps
expanding, it might expand into the acquirer's own territory.  Most
product acquisitions have some component of fear.  Even if an
acquirer isn't threatened by the startup itself, they might be
alarmed at the thought of what a competitor could do with it.  And
because startups are in this sense doubly valuable to acquirers,
acquirers will often pay more than an ordinary investor would. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#999999">14</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Understand</b><br><br>The combination of founders, investors, and acquirers forms a natural
ecosystem.  It works so well that those who don't understand it are
driven to invent conspiracy theories to explain how neatly things
sometimes turn out.  Just as our ancestors did to explain the
apparently too neat workings of the natural world.  But there is
no secret cabal making it all work.<br><br>If you start from the mistaken assumption that Instagram was
worthless, you have to invent a secret boss to force Mark Zuckerberg
to buy it.  To anyone who knows Mark Zuckerberg, that is the reductio
ad absurdum of the initial assumption.  The reason he bought Instagram
was that it was valuable and dangerous, and what made it so was
growth.<br><br>If you want to understand startups, understand growth.  Growth
drives everything in this world.  Growth is why startups usually
work on technology — because ideas for fast growing companies are
so rare that the best way to find new ones is to discover those
recently made viable by change, and technology is the best source
of rapid change.  Growth is why it's a rational choice economically
for so many founders to try starting a startup: growth makes the
successful companies so valuable that the expected value is high
even though the risk is too.  Growth is why VCs want to invest in
startups: not just because the returns are high but also because
generating returns from capital gains is easier to manage than
generating returns from dividends.  Growth explains why the most
successful startups take VC money even if they don't need to: it
lets them choose their growth rate.  And growth explains why
successful startups almost invariably get acquisition offers.  To
acquirers a fast-growing company is not merely valuable but dangerous
too.<br><br>It's not just that if you want to succeed in some domain, you have
to understand the forces driving it.  Understanding growth is what
starting a startup <i>consists</i> of.  What you're really doing (and
to the dismay of some observers, all you're really doing) when you
start a startup is committing to solve a harder type of problem
than ordinary businesses do.  You're committing to search for one
of the rare ideas that generates rapid growth.  Because these ideas
are so valuable, finding one is hard.  The startup is the embodiment
of your discoveries so far.  Starting a startup is thus very much
like deciding to be a research scientist: you're not committing to
solve any specific problem; you don't know for sure which problems
are soluble; but you're committing to try to discover something no
one knew before.  A startup founder is in effect an economic research
scientist.  Most don't discover anything that remarkable, but some
discover relativity.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Strictly speaking it's not lots of customers you need but a big
market, meaning a high product of number of customers times how
much they'll pay.  But it's dangerous to have too few customers
even if they pay a lot, or the power that individual customers have
over you could turn you into a de facto consulting firm.  So whatever
market you're in, you'll usually do best to err on the side of
making the broadest type of product for it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
One year at Startup School David Heinemeier Hansson encouraged
programmers who wanted to start businesses to use a restaurant as
a model.  What he meant, I believe, is that it's fine to start
software companies constrained in (a) in the same way a restaurant
is constrained in (b).  I agree.  Most people should not try to
start startups.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
That sort of stepping back is one of the things we focus on at
Y Combinator.  It's common for founders to have discovered something
intuitively without understanding all its implications.  That's
probably true of the biggest discoveries in any field.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
I got it wrong in <a href="wealth.html">"How to Make Wealth"</a> when I said that a
startup was a small company that takes on a hard technical
problem.  That is the most common recipe but not the only one.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
In principle companies aren't limited by the size of the markets
they serve, because they could just expand into new markets.  But
there seem to be limits on the ability of big companies to do that.
Which means the slowdown that comes from bumping up against the
limits of one's markets is ultimately just another way in which
internal limits are expressed.<br><br>It may be that some of these limits could be overcome by changing
the shape of the organization — specifically by sharding it.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
This is, obviously, only for startups that have already launched
or can launch during YC.  A startup building a new database will
probably not do that.  On the other hand, launching something small
and then using growth rate as evolutionary pressure is such a
valuable technique that any company that could start this way
probably should.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
If the startup is taking the Facebook/Twitter route and building
something they hope will be very popular but from which they don't
yet have a definite plan to make money, the growth rate has to be
higher, even though it's a proxy for revenue growth, because such
companies need huge numbers of users to succeed at all.<br><br>Beware too of the edge case where something spreads rapidly but the
churn is high as well, so that you have good net growth till you run
through all the potential users, at which point it suddenly stops.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Within YC when we say it's ipso facto right to do whatever gets
you growth, it's implicit that this excludes trickery like buying
users for more than their lifetime value, counting users as active
when they're really not, bleeding out invites at a regularly
increasing rate to manufacture a perfect growth curve, etc.  Even
if you were able to fool investors with such tricks, you'd ultimately
be hurting yourself, because you're throwing off your own compass.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Which is why it's such a dangerous mistake to believe that
successful startups are simply the embodiment of some brilliant
initial idea.  What you're looking for initially is not so much a
great idea as an idea that could evolve into a great one.   The
danger is that promising ideas are not merely blurry versions of
great ones.  They're often different in kind, because the early
adopters you evolve the idea upon have different needs from the
rest of the market.  For example, the idea that evolves into Facebook
isn't merely a subset of Facebook; the idea that evolves into
Facebook is a site for Harvard undergrads.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
What if a company grew at 1.7x a year for a really long time?
Could it not grow just as big as any successful startup?  In principle
yes, of course. If our hypothetical company making $1000 a month
grew at 1% a week for 19 years, it would grow as big as a company
growing at 5% a week for 4 years.  But while such trajectories may
be common in, say, real estate development, you don't see them much
in the technology business.  In technology, companies that grow
slowly tend not to grow as big.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
Any expected value calculation varies from person to person
depending on their utility function for money.  I.e. the first
million is worth more to most people than subsequent millions.  How
much more depends on the person.  For founders who are younger or
more ambitious the utility function is flatter.  Which is probably
part of the reason the founders of the most successful startups of
all tend to be on the young side.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
More precisely, this is the case in the biggest winners, which
is where all the returns come from.  A startup founder could pull
the same trick of enriching himself at the company's expense by
selling them overpriced components.  But it wouldn't be worth it
for the founders of Google to do that.  Only founders of failing
startups would even be tempted, but those are writeoffs from the
VCs' point of view anyway.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
Acquisitions fall into two categories: those where the acquirer
wants the business, and those where the acquirer just wants the
employees.  The latter type is sometimes called an HR acquisition.
Though nominally acquisitions and sometimes on a scale that has a
significant effect on the expected value calculation for potential
founders, HR acquisitions are viewed by acquirers as more akin to
hiring bonuses.<br><br>[<a name="f14n"><font color="#000000">14</font></a>]
I once explained this to some founders who had recently arrived
from Russia.  They found it novel that if you threatened a company
they'd pay a premium for you.  "In Russia they just kill you," they
said, and they were only partly joking.  Economically, the fact
that established companies can't simply eliminate new competitors
may be one of the most valuable aspects of the rule of law.  And
so to the extent we see incumbents suppressing competitors via
regulations or patent suits, we should worry, not because it's a
departure from the rule of law per se but from what the rule of law
is aiming at.<br><br>

October 2012<br><br>One advantage of Y Combinator's early, broad focus is that we
see trends before most other people.  And one of the most conspicuous
trends in the last batch was the large number of hardware startups.
Out of 84 companies, 7 were making hardware.  On the whole
they've done better than the companies that weren't.<br><br>They've faced resistance from investors of course.  Investors have
a deep-seated bias against hardware.  But investors' opinions are
a trailing indicator.  The best founders are better at seeing the
future than the best investors, because the best founders are making
it.<br><br>There is no one single force driving this trend.  Hardware <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/pebble-smartwatch-tops-out-at-10-million-on-kickstarter/">does
well</a> on crowdfunding sites.  The spread of <a href="http://paulgraham.com/tablets.html">tablets</a> makes it
possible to build new things <a href="http://lockitron.com">controlled
by</a> and even <a href="http://doublerobotics.com">incorporating</a>
them.  <a href="http://www.boostedboards.com/">Electric motors</a>
 have improved.
Wireless connectivity of various types can now be taken for granted.
It's getting more straightforward to get things manufactured.
Arduinos, 3D printing, laser cutters, and more accessible CNC milling are making hardware easier to prototype.
Retailers are less of a bottleneck as customers increasingly buy
online.<br><br>One question I can answer is why hardware is suddenly cool.
It always was cool.
Physical things are great.  They just haven't
been as great a way to start a <a href="growth.html">rapidly growing</a> business
as software.  But that rule may not be permanent.  It's not even
that old; it only dates from about 1990.  Maybe the advantage
of software will turn out to have been temporary.  Hackers love to
build hardware, and customers love to buy it.  So if the ease of
shipping hardware even approached the ease of shipping software,
we'd see a lot more hardware startups.<br><br>It wouldn't be the first time something was a bad idea till it
wasn't.  And it wouldn't be the first time investors learned that
lesson from founders.<br><br>So if you want to work on hardware, don't be deterred from doing
it because you worry investors will discriminate against you.  And
in particular, don't be deterred from <a href="http://ycombinator.com/apply.html">applying</a> to Y Combinator
with a hardware idea, because we're especially interested in hardware
startups.<br><br>We know there's room for the <a href="ambitious.html">next Steve Jobs</a>.
But there's almost certainly also room for the first

<p>
November 2012<br><br>The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup
ideas.  It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have
yourself.<br><br>The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common:
they're something the founders themselves want, that they themselves
can build, and that few others realize are worth doing.  Microsoft,
Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began this way.<br><br>
<b>Problems</b><br><br>Why is it so important to work on a problem you have?  Among other
things, it ensures the problem really exists.  It sounds obvious
to say you should only work on problems that exist.  And yet by far
the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one
has.<br><br>I made it myself.  In 1995 I started a company to put art galleries
online.  But galleries didn't want to be online.  It's not how the
art business works.  So why did I spend 6 months working on this
stupid idea?  Because I didn't pay attention to users.  I invented
a model of the world that didn't correspond to reality, and worked
from that.  I didn't notice my model was wrong until I tried
to convince users to pay for what we'd built.  Even then I took
embarrassingly long to catch on.  I was attached to my model of the
world, and I'd spent a lot of time on the software.  They had to
want it!<br><br>Why do so many founders build things no one wants?  Because they
begin by trying to think of startup ideas.  That m.o. is doubly
dangerous: it doesn't merely yield few good ideas; it yields bad
ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them.<br><br>At YC we call these "made-up" or "sitcom" startup ideas.  Imagine
one of the characters on a TV show was starting a startup.  The
writers would have to invent something for it to do.  But coming
up with good startup ideas is hard.  It's not something you can do
for the asking.  So (unless they got amazingly lucky) the writers
would come up with an idea that sounded plausible, but was actually
bad.<br><br>For example, a social network for pet owners.  It doesn't sound
obviously mistaken.  Millions of people have pets.  Often they care
a lot about their pets and spend a lot of money on them.  Surely
many of these people would like a site where they could talk to
other pet owners.  Not all of them perhaps, but if just 2 or 3
percent were regular visitors, you could have millions of users.
You could serve them targeted offers, and maybe charge for premium
features. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by your
friends with pets, they don't say "I would <i>never</i> use this." They
say "Yeah, maybe I could see using something like that." Even when
the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people.
They don't want to use it themselves, at least not right now, but
they could imagine other people wanting it.  Sum that reaction
across the entire population, and you have zero users. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Well</b><br><br>When a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who
really need what they're making — not just people who could see
themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently.  Usually
this initial group of users is small, for the simple reason that
if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed
and that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usually
puts into a version one, it would probably already exist.  Which
means you have to compromise on one dimension: you can either build
something a large number of people want a small amount, or something
a small number of people want a large amount.  Choose the latter.
Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all
good startup ideas are of that type.<br><br>Imagine a graph whose x axis represents all the people who might
want what you're making and whose y axis represents how much they
want it.  If you invert the scale on the y axis, you can envision
companies as holes.  Google is an immense crater: hundreds of
millions of people use it, and they need it a lot.  A startup just
starting out can't expect to excavate that much volume.  So you
have two choices about the shape of hole you start with.  You can
either dig a hole that's broad but shallow, or one that's narrow
and deep, like a well.<br><br>Made-up startup ideas are usually of the first type.  Lots of people
are mildly interested in a social network for pet owners.<br><br>Nearly all good startup ideas are of the second type.  Microsoft
was a well when they made Altair Basic.  There were only a couple
thousand Altair owners, but without this software they were programming
in machine language.  Thirty years later Facebook had the same
shape.  Their first site was exclusively for Harvard students, of
which there are only a few thousand, but those few thousand users
wanted it a lot.<br><br>When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this
right now?  Who wants this so much that they'll use it even when
it's a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they've never
heard of?  If you can't answer that, the idea is probably bad. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>You don't need the narrowness of the well per se.  It's depth you
need; you get narrowness as a byproduct of optimizing for depth
(and speed).  But you almost always do get it.  In practice the
link between depth and narrowness is so strong that it's a good
sign when you know that an idea will appeal strongly to a specific
group or type of user.<br><br>But while demand shaped like a well is almost a necessary condition
for a good startup idea, it's not a sufficient one.  If Mark
Zuckerberg had built something that could only ever have appealed
to Harvard students, it would not have been a good startup idea.
Facebook was a good idea because it started with a small market
there was a fast path out of.  Colleges are similar enough that if
you build a facebook that works at Harvard, it will work at any
college. So you spread rapidly through all the colleges.  Once you
have all the college students, you get everyone else simply by
letting them in.<br><br>Similarly for Microsoft: Basic for the Altair; Basic for other
machines; other languages besides Basic; operating systems;
applications; IPO.<br><br>
<b>Self</b><br><br>How do you tell whether there's a path out of an idea?  How do you
tell whether something is the germ of a giant company, or just a
niche product?  Often you can't. The founders of Airbnb didn't
realize at first how big a market they were tapping.  Initially
they had a much narrower idea.  They were going to let hosts rent
out space on their floors during conventions.  They didn't foresee
the expansion of this idea; it forced itself upon them gradually.
All they knew at first is that they were onto something.  That's
probably as much as Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg knew at first.<br><br>Occasionally it's obvious from the beginning when there's a path
out of the initial niche.  And sometimes I can see a path that's
not immediately obvious; that's one of our specialties at YC.  But
there are limits to how well this can be done, no matter how much
experience you have.  The most important thing to understand about
paths out of the initial idea is the meta-fact that these are hard
to see.<br><br>So if you can't predict whether there's a path out of an idea, how
do you choose between ideas?  The truth is disappointing but
interesting: if you're the right sort of person, you have the right
sort of hunches.  If you're at the leading edge of a field that's
changing fast, when you have a hunch that something is worth doing,
you're more likely to be right.<br><br>In <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>, Robert Pirsig says:
</p><blockquote>
  You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It's easy.  Make
  yourself perfect and then just paint naturally.
</blockquote>
I've wondered about that passage since I read it in high school.
I'm not sure how useful his advice is for painting specifically,
but it fits this situation well.  Empirically, the way to have good
startup ideas is to become the sort of person who has them.<br><br>Being at the leading edge of a field doesn't mean you have to be
one of the people pushing it forward.  You can also be at the leading
edge as a user.  It was not so much because he was a programmer
that Facebook seemed a good idea to Mark Zuckerberg as because he
used computers so much.  If you'd asked most 40 year olds in 2004
whether they'd like to publish their lives semi-publicly on the
Internet, they'd have been horrified at the idea.  But Mark already
lived online; to him it seemed natural.<br><br>Paul Buchheit says that people at the leading edge of a rapidly
changing field "live in the future."  Combine that with Pirsig and
you get:
<blockquote>
  Live in the future, then build what's missing.
</blockquote>
That describes the way many if not most of the biggest startups got
started.  Neither Apple nor Yahoo nor Google nor Facebook were even
supposed to be companies at first.  They grew out of things their
founders built because there seemed a gap in the world.<br><br>If you look at the way successful founders have had their ideas,
it's generally the result of some external stimulus hitting a
prepared mind.  Bill Gates and Paul Allen hear about the Altair and
think "I bet we could write a Basic interpreter for it." Drew Houston
realizes he's forgotten his USB stick and thinks "I really need to
make my files live online." Lots of people heard about the Altair.
Lots forgot USB sticks.  The reason those stimuli caused those
founders to start companies was that their experiences had prepared
them to notice the opportunities they represented.<br><br>The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not
"think up" but "notice." At YC we call ideas that grow naturally
out of the founders' own experiences "organic" startup ideas.  The
most successful startups almost all begin this way.<br><br>That may not have been what you wanted to hear.  You may have
expected recipes for coming up with startup ideas, and instead I'm
telling you that the key is to have a mind that's prepared in the
right way.  But disappointing though it may be, this is the truth.
And it is a recipe of a sort, just one that in the worst case takes
a year rather than a weekend.<br><br>If you're not at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field,
you can get to one.  For example, anyone reasonably smart can
probably get to an edge of programming (e.g. building mobile apps)
in a year.  Since a successful startup will consume at least 3-5
years of your life, a year's preparation would be a reasonable
investment.  Especially if you're also looking for a cofounder.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>You don't have to learn programming to be at the leading edge of a
domain that's changing fast.  Other domains change fast.  But while
learning to hack is not necessary, it is for the forseeable future
sufficient. As Marc Andreessen put it, software is eating the world,
and this trend has decades left to run.<br><br>Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you'll be
able to implement them.  That's not absolutely necessary (Jeff Bezos
couldn't) but it's an advantage.  It's a big advantage, when you're
considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if
instead of merely thinking "That's an interesting idea," you can
think instead "That's an interesting idea.  I'll try building an
initial version tonight."  It's even better when you're both a
programmer and the target user, because then the cycle of generating
new versions and testing them on users can happen inside one head.<br><br>
<b>Noticing</b><br><br>Once you're living in the future in some respect, the way to notice
startup ideas is to look for things that seem to be missing.  If
you're really at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field, there
will be things that are obviously missing.  What won't be obvious
is that they're startup ideas.  So if you want to find startup
ideas, don't merely turn on the filter "What's missing?" Also turn
off every other filter, particularly "Could this be a big company?"
There's plenty of time to apply that test later.  But if you're
thinking about that initially, it may not only filter out lots
of good ideas, but also cause you to focus on bad ones.<br><br>Most things that are missing will take some time to see.  You almost
have to trick yourself into seeing the ideas around you.<br><br>But you <i>know</i> the ideas are out there.  This is not one of those
problems where there might not be an answer.  It's impossibly
unlikely that this is the exact moment when technological progress
stops.  You can be sure people are going to build things in the
next few years that will make you think "What did I do before x?"<br><br>And when these problems get solved, they will probably seem flamingly
obvious in retrospect.  What you need to do is turn off the filters
that usually prevent you from seeing them.  The most powerful is
simply taking the current state of the world for granted.  Even the
most radically open-minded of us mostly do that.  You couldn't get
from your bed to the front door if you stopped to question everything.<br><br>But if you're looking for startup ideas you can sacrifice some of
the efficiency of taking the status quo for granted and start to
question things.  Why is your inbox overflowing?  Because you get
a lot of email, or because it's hard to get email out of your inbox?
Why do you get so much email?  What problems are people trying to
solve by sending you email?  Are there better ways to solve them?
And why is it hard to get emails out of your inbox?  Why do you
keep emails around after you've read them?  Is an inbox the optimal
tool for that?<br><br>Pay particular attention to things that chafe you.  The advantage
of taking the status quo for granted is not just that it makes life
(locally) more efficient, but also that it makes life more tolerable.
If you knew about all the things we'll get in the next 50 years but
don't have yet, you'd find present day life pretty constraining,
just as someone from the present would if they were sent back 50
years in a time machine.  When something annoys you, it could be
because you're living in the future.<br><br>When you find the right sort of problem, you should probably be
able to describe it as <i>obvious</i>, at least to you.  When we started
Viaweb, all the online stores were built by hand, by web designers
making individual HTML pages.  It was obvious to us as programmers
that these sites would have to be generated by software.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Which means, strangely enough, that coming up with startup ideas
is a question of seeing the obvious.  That suggests how weird this
process is: you're trying to see things that are obvious, and yet
that you hadn't seen.<br><br>Since what you need to do here is loosen up your own mind, it may
be best not to make too much of a direct frontal attack on the
problem — i.e. to sit down and try to think of ideas.  The best
plan may be just to keep a background process running, looking for
things that seem to be missing.  Work on hard problems, driven
mainly by curiosity, but have a second self watching over your
shoulder, taking note of gaps and anomalies.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Give yourself some time.  You have a lot of control over the rate
at which you turn yours into a prepared mind, but you have less
control over the stimuli that spark ideas when they hit it.  If
Bill Gates and Paul Allen had constrained themselves to come up
with a startup idea in one month, what if they'd chosen a month
before the Altair appeared?  They probably would have worked on a
less promising idea.  Drew Houston did work on a less promising
idea before Dropbox: an SAT prep startup.  But Dropbox was a much
better idea, both in the absolute sense and also as a match for his
skills.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>A good way to trick yourself into noticing ideas is to work on
projects that seem like they'd be cool.  If you do that, you'll
naturally tend to build things that are missing.  It wouldn't seem
as interesting to build something that already existed.<br><br>Just as trying to think up startup ideas tends to produce bad ones,
working on things that could be dismissed as "toys" often produces
good ones.  When something is described as a toy, that means it has
everything an idea needs except being important.  It's cool; users
love it; it just doesn't matter.  But if you're living in the future
and you build something cool that users love, it may matter more
than outsiders think.  Microcomputers seemed like toys when Apple
and Microsoft started working on them.  I'm old enough to remember
that era; the usual term for people with their own microcomputers
was "hobbyists."  BackRub seemed like an inconsequential science
project.  The Facebook was just a way for undergrads to stalk one
another.<br><br>At YC we're excited when we meet startups working on things that
we could imagine know-it-alls on forums dismissing as toys.  To us
that's positive evidence an idea is good.<br><br>If you can afford to take a long view (and arguably you can't afford
not to), you can turn "Live in the future and build what's missing"
into something even better:
<blockquote>
  Live in the future and build what seems interesting.
</blockquote><br><br>
<b>School</b><br><br>That's what I'd advise college students to do, rather than trying
to learn about "entrepreneurship."  "Entrepreneurship" is something
you learn best by doing it.  The examples of the most successful
founders make that clear.  What you should be spending your time
on in college is ratcheting yourself into the future.  College is
an incomparable opportunity to do that.  What a waste to sacrifice
an opportunity to solve the hard part of starting a startup — becoming 
the sort of person who can have organic startup ideas — by 
spending time learning about the easy part.  Especially since
you won't even really learn about it, any more than you'd learn
about sex in a class.  All you'll learn is the words for things.<br><br>The clash of domains is a particularly fruitful source of ideas.
If you know a lot about programming and you start learning about
some other field, you'll probably see problems that software could
solve.  In fact, you're doubly likely to find good problems in
another domain: (a) the inhabitants of that domain are not as likely
as software people to have already solved their problems with
software, and (b) since you come into the new domain totally ignorant,
you don't even know what the status quo is to take it for granted.<br><br>So if you're a CS major and you want to start a startup, instead
of taking a class on entrepreneurship you're better off taking a
class on, say, genetics.  Or better still, go work for a biotech
company.  CS majors normally get summer jobs at computer hardware
or software companies.  But if you want to find startup ideas, you
might do better to get a summer job in some unrelated field. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>Or don't take any extra classes, and just build things.  It's no
coincidence that Microsoft and Facebook both got started in January.
At Harvard that is (or was) Reading Period, when students have no
classes to attend because they're supposed to be studying for finals.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>But don't feel like you have to build things that will become startups.  That's
premature optimization. Just build things.  Preferably with other
students.  It's not just the classes that make a university such a
good place to crank oneself into the future.  You're also surrounded
by other people trying to do the same thing.  If you work together
with them on projects, you'll end up producing not just organic
ideas, but organic ideas with organic founding teams — and that,
empirically, is the best combination.<br><br>Beware of research.  If an undergrad writes something all his friends
start using, it's quite likely to represent a good startup idea.
Whereas a PhD dissertation is extremely unlikely to.  For some
reason, the more a project has to count as research, the less likely
it is to be something that could be turned into a startup.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font>
I think the reason is that the subset of ideas that count as research
is so narrow that it's unlikely that a project that satisfied that
constraint would also satisfy the orthogonal constraint of solving
users' problems.  Whereas when students (or professors) build
something as a side-project, they automatically gravitate toward
solving users' problems — perhaps even with an additional energy
that comes from being freed from the constraints of research.<br><br>
<b>Competition</b><br><br>Because a good idea should seem obvious, when you have one you'll
tend to feel that you're late.  Don't let that deter you.  Worrying
that you're late is one of the signs of a good idea.  Ten minutes
of searching the web will usually settle the question.  Even if you
find someone else working on the same thing, you're probably not
too late.  It's exceptionally rare for startups to be killed by
competitors — so rare that you can almost discount the possibility.
So unless you discover a competitor with the sort of lock-in that
would prevent users from choosing you, don't discard the idea.<br><br>If you're uncertain, ask users.  The question of whether you're too
late is subsumed by the question of whether anyone urgently needs
what you plan to make.  If you have something that no competitor
does and that some subset of users urgently need, you have a
beachhead.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>The question then is whether that beachhead is big enough. Or more
importantly, who's in it: if the beachhead consists of people doing
something lots more people will be doing in the future, then it's
probably big enough no matter how small it is.  For example, if
you're building something differentiated from competitors by the
fact that it works on phones, but it only works on the newest phones,
that's probably a big enough beachhead.<br><br>Err on the side of doing things where you'll face competitors.
Inexperienced founders usually give competitors more credit than
they deserve.  Whether you succeed depends far more on you than on
your competitors.  So better a good idea with competitors than a
bad one without.<br><br>You don't need to worry about entering a "crowded market" so long
as you have a thesis about what everyone else in it is overlooking.
In fact that's a very promising starting point.  Google was that
type of idea.  Your thesis has to be more precise than "we're going
to make an x that doesn't suck" though. You have to be able to
phrase it in terms of something the incumbents are overlooking.
Best of all is when you can say that they didn't have the courage
of their convictions, and that your plan is what they'd have done
if they'd followed through on their own insights.  Google was that
type of idea too.  The search engines that preceded them shied away
from the most radical implications of what they were doing — particularly 
that the better a job they did, the faster users would
leave.<br><br>A crowded market is actually a good sign, because it means both
that there's demand and that none of the existing solutions are
good enough.  A startup can't hope to enter a market that's obviously
big and yet in which they have no competitors.  So any startup that
succeeds is either going to be entering a market with existing
competitors, but armed with some secret weapon that will get them
all the users (like Google), or entering a market that looks small
but which will turn out to be big (like Microsoft).  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Filters</b><br><br>There are two more filters you'll need to turn off if you want to
notice startup ideas: the unsexy filter and the schlep filter.<br><br>Most programmers wish they could start a startup by just writing
some brilliant code, pushing it to a server, and having users pay
them lots of money.  They'd prefer not to deal with tedious problems
or get involved in messy ways with the real world.  Which is a
reasonable preference, because such things slow you down.  But this
preference is so widespread that the space of convenient startup
ideas has been stripped pretty clean.  If you let your mind wander
a few blocks down the street to the messy, tedious ideas, you'll
find valuable ones just sitting there waiting to be implemented.<br><br>The schlep filter is so dangerous that I wrote a separate essay
about the condition it induces, which I called 
<a href="schlep.html">schlep blindness</a>.
I gave Stripe as an example of a startup that benefited from turning
off this filter, and a pretty striking example it is.  Thousands
of programmers were in a position to see this idea; thousands of
programmers knew how painful it was to process payments before
Stripe.  But when they looked for startup ideas they didn't see
this one, because unconsciously they shrank from having to deal
with payments.  And dealing with payments is a schlep for Stripe,
but not an intolerable one.  In fact they might have had net less
pain; because the fear of dealing with payments kept most people
away from this idea, Stripe has had comparatively smooth sailing
in other areas that are sometimes painful, like user acquisition.
They didn't have to try very hard to make themselves heard by users,
because users were desperately waiting for what they were building.<br><br>The unsexy filter is similar to the schlep filter, except it keeps
you from working on problems you despise rather than ones you fear.
We overcame this one to work on Viaweb. There were interesting
things about the architecture of our software, but we weren't
interested in ecommerce per se.  We could see the problem was one
that needed to be solved though.<br><br>Turning off the schlep filter is more important than turning off
the unsexy filter, because the schlep filter is more likely to be
an illusion.  And even to the degree it isn't, it's a worse form
of self-indulgence.  Starting a successful startup is going to be
fairly laborious no matter what.  Even if the product doesn't entail
a lot of schleps, you'll still have plenty dealing with investors,
hiring and firing people, and so on.  So if there's some idea you
think would be cool but you're kept away from by fear of the schleps
involved, don't worry: any sufficiently good idea will have as many.<br><br>The unsexy filter, while still a source of error, is not as entirely
useless as the schlep filter.  If you're at the leading edge of a
field that's changing rapidly, your ideas about what's sexy will
be somewhat correlated with what's valuable in practice.  Particularly
as you get older and more experienced.  Plus if you find an idea
sexy, you'll work on it more enthusiastically. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Recipes</b><br><br>While the best way to discover startup ideas is to become the sort
of person who has them and then build whatever interests you,
sometimes you don't have that luxury.  Sometimes you need an idea
now.  For example, if you're working on a startup and your initial
idea turns out to be bad.<br><br>For the rest of this essay I'll talk about tricks for coming up
with startup ideas on demand.  Although empirically you're better
off using the organic strategy, you could succeed this way. You
just have to be more disciplined.  When you use the organic method,
you don't even notice an idea unless it's evidence that something
is truly missing.  But when you make a conscious effort to think
of startup ideas, you have to replace this natural constraint with
self-discipline.  You'll see a lot more ideas, most of them bad,
so you need to be able to filter them.<br><br>One of the biggest dangers of not using the organic method is the
example of the organic method.  Organic ideas feel like inspirations.
There are a lot of stories about successful startups that began
when the founders had what seemed a crazy idea but "just knew" it
was promising.  When you feel that about an idea you've had while
trying to come up with startup ideas, you're probably mistaken.<br><br>When searching for ideas, look in areas where you have some expertise.
If you're a database expert, don't build a chat app for teenagers
(unless you're also a teenager).  Maybe it's a good idea, but you
can't trust your judgment about that, so ignore it.  There have to
be other ideas that involve databases, and whose quality you can
judge.  Do you find it hard to come up with good ideas involving
databases?  That's because your expertise raises your standards.
Your ideas about chat apps are just as bad, but you're giving
yourself a Dunning-Kruger pass in that domain.<br><br>The place to start looking for ideas is things you need.  There
<i>must</i> be things you need.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#999999">14</font></a>]</font><br><br>One good trick is to ask yourself whether in your previous job you
ever found yourself saying "Why doesn't someone make x?  If someone
made x we'd buy it in a second." If you can think of any x people
said that about, you probably have an idea.  You know there's demand,
and people don't say that about things that are impossible to build.<br><br>More generally, try asking yourself whether there's something unusual
about you that makes your needs different from most other people's.
You're probably not the only one.  It's especially good if you're
different in a way people will increasingly be.<br><br>If you're changing ideas, one unusual thing about you is the idea
you'd previously been working on.  Did you discover any needs while
working on it?  Several well-known startups began this way.  Hotmail
began as something its founders wrote to talk about their previous
startup idea while they were working at their day jobs. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#999999">15</font></a>]</font><br><br>A particularly promising way to be unusual is to be young.  Some
of the most valuable new ideas take root first among people in their
teens and early twenties.  And while young founders are at a
disadvantage in some respects, they're the only ones who really
understand their peers.  It would have been very hard for someone
who wasn't a college student to start Facebook.  So if you're a
young founder (under 23 say), are there things you and your friends
would like to do that current technology won't let you?<br><br>The next best thing to an unmet need of your own is an unmet need
of someone else.  Try talking to everyone you can about the gaps
they find in the world.  What's missing?  What would they like to
do that they can't?  What's tedious or annoying, particularly in
their work?  Let the conversation get general; don't be trying too
hard to find startup ideas.  You're just looking for something to
spark a thought.  Maybe you'll notice a problem they didn't consciously
realize they had, because you know how to solve it.<br><br>When you find an unmet need that isn't your own, it may be somewhat
blurry at first.  The person who needs something may not know exactly
what they need.  In that case I often recommend that founders act
like consultants — that they do what they'd do if they'd been
retained to solve the problems of this one user.  People's problems
are similar enough that nearly all the code you write this way will
be reusable, and whatever isn't will be a small price to start out
certain that you've reached the bottom of the well.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#999999">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>One way to ensure you do a good job solving other people's problems
is to make them your own.  When Rajat Suri of E la Carte decided
to write software for restaurants, he got a job as a waiter to learn
how restaurants worked.  That may seem like taking things to extremes,
but startups are extreme.  We love it when founders do such things.<br><br>In fact, one strategy I recommend to people who need a new idea is
not merely to turn off their schlep and unsexy filters, but to seek
out ideas that are unsexy or involve schleps.  Don't try to start
Twitter.  Those ideas are so rare that you can't find them by looking
for them.  Make something unsexy that people will pay you for.<br><br>A good trick for bypassing the schlep and to some extent the unsexy
filter is to ask what you wish someone else would build, so that
you could use it.  What would you pay for right now?<br><br>Since startups often garbage-collect broken companies and industries,
it can be a good trick to look for those that are dying, or deserve
to, and try to imagine what kind of company would profit from their
demise.  For example, journalism is in free fall at the moment.
But there may still be money to be made from something like journalism.
What sort of company might cause people in the future to say "this
replaced journalism" on some axis?<br><br>But imagine asking that in the future, not now.  When one company
or industry replaces another, it usually comes in from the side.
So don't look for a replacement for x; look for something that
people will later say turned out to be a replacement for x.  And
be imaginative about the axis along which the replacement occurs.
Traditional journalism, for example, is a way for readers to get
information and to kill time, a way for writers to make money and
to get attention, and a vehicle for several different types of
advertising.  It could be replaced on any of these axes (it has
already started to be on most).<br><br>When startups consume incumbents, they usually start by serving
some small but important market that the big players ignore.  It's
particularly good if there's an admixture of disdain in the big
players' attitude, because that often misleads them.  For example,
after Steve Wozniak built the computer that became the Apple I, he
felt obliged to give his then-employer Hewlett-Packard the option
to produce it.  Fortunately for him, they turned it down, and one
of the reasons they did was that it used a TV for a monitor, which
seemed intolerably d�class� to a high-end hardware company like HP
was at the time. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f17n"><font color="#999999">17</font></a>]</font><br><br>Are there groups of 
<a href="marginal.html">scruffy</a> 
but sophisticated users like the early
microcomputer "hobbyists" that are currently being ignored by the
big players?  A startup with its sights set on bigger things can
often capture a small market easily by expending an effort that
wouldn't be justified by that market alone.<br><br>Similarly, since the most successful startups generally ride some
wave bigger than themselves, it could be a good trick to look for
waves and ask how one could benefit from them.  The prices of gene
sequencing and 3D printing are both experiencing Moore's Law-like
declines.  What new things will we be able to do in the new world
we'll have in a few years?  What are we unconsciously ruling out
as impossible that will soon be possible?<br><br>
<b>Organic</b><br><br>But talking about looking explicitly for waves makes it clear that
such recipes are plan B for getting startup ideas.  Looking for
waves is essentially a way to simulate the organic method.  If
you're at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you don't
have to look for waves; you are the wave.<br><br>Finding startup ideas is a subtle business, and that's why most
people who try fail so miserably.  It doesn't work well simply to
try to think of startup ideas.  If you do that, you get bad ones
that sound dangerously plausible.  The best approach is more indirect:
if you have the right sort of background, good startup ideas will
seem obvious to you.  But even then, not immediately.  It takes
time to come across situations where you notice something missing.
And often these gaps won't seem to be ideas for companies, just
things that would be interesting to build.  Which is why it's good
to have the time and the inclination to build things just because
they're interesting.<br><br>Live in the future and build what seems interesting.  Strange as
it sounds, that's the real recipe.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This form of bad idea has been around as long as the web.  It
was common in the 1990s, except then people who had it used to say
they were going to create a portal for x instead of a social network
for x.  Structurally the idea is stone soup: you post a sign saying
"this is the place for people interested in x," and all those people
show up and you make money from them.  What lures founders into
this sort of idea are statistics about the millions of people who
might be interested in each type of x.  What they forget is that
any given person might have 20 affinities by this standard, and no
one is going to visit 20 different communities regularly.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
I'm not saying, incidentally, that I know for sure a social
network for pet owners is a bad idea.  I know it's a bad idea the
way I know randomly generated DNA would not produce a viable organism.
The set of plausible sounding startup ideas is many times larger
than the set of good ones, and many of the good ones don't even
sound that plausible.  So if all you know about a startup idea is
that it sounds plausible, you have to assume it's bad.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
More precisely, the users' need has to give them sufficient
activation energy to start using whatever you make, which can vary
a lot.  For example, the activation energy for enterprise software
sold through traditional channels is very high, so you'd have to
be a <i>lot</i> better to get users to switch.  Whereas the activation
energy required to switch to a new search engine is low.  Which in
turn is why search engines are so much better than enterprise
software.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
This gets harder as you get older.  While the space of ideas
doesn't have dangerous local maxima, the space of careers does.
There are fairly high walls between most of the paths people take
through life, and the older you get, the higher the walls become.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
It was also obvious to us that the web was going to be a big
deal.  Few non-programmers grasped that in 1995, but the programmers
had seen what GUIs had done for desktop computers.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Maybe it would work to have this second self keep a journal,
and each night to make a brief entry listing the gaps and anomalies
you'd noticed that day.  Not startup ideas, just the raw gaps and
anomalies.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Sam Altman points out that taking time to come up with an
idea is not merely a better strategy in an absolute sense, but also
like an undervalued stock in that so few founders do it.<br><br>There's comparatively little competition for the best ideas, because
few founders are willing to put in the time required to notice them.
Whereas there is a great deal of competition for mediocre ideas,
because when people make up startup ideas, they tend to make up the
same ones.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
For the computer hardware and software companies, summer jobs
are the first phase of the recruiting funnel.  But if you're good
you can skip the first phase.  If you're good you'll have no trouble
getting hired by these companies when you graduate, regardless of
how you spent your summers.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
The empirical evidence suggests that if colleges want to help
their students start startups, the best thing they can do is leave
them alone in the right way.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
I'm speaking here of IT startups; in biotech things are different.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
This is an instance of a more general rule: focus on users,
not competitors.  The most important information about competitors
is what you learn via users anyway.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
In practice most successful startups have elements of both.
And you can describe each strategy in terms of the other by adjusting
the boundaries of what you call the market.  But it's useful to
consider these two ideas separately.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
I almost hesitate to raise that point though.  Startups are
businesses; the point of a business is to make money; and with that
additional constraint, you can't expect you'll be able to spend all
your time working on what interests you most.<br><br>[<a name="f14n"><font color="#000000">14</font></a>]
The need has to be a strong one.  You can retroactively
describe any made-up idea as something you need.  But do you really
need that recipe site or local event aggregator as much as Drew
Houston needed Dropbox, or Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia needed Airbnb?<br><br>Quite often at YC I find myself asking founders "Would you use this
thing yourself, if you hadn't written it?" and you'd be surprised
how often the answer is no.<br><br>[<a name="f15n"><font color="#000000">15</font></a>]
Paul Buchheit points out that trying to sell something bad
can be a source of better ideas:<br><br>"The best technique I've found for dealing with YC companies that
have bad ideas is to tell them to go sell the product ASAP (before
wasting time building it). Not only do they learn that nobody
wants what they are building, they very often come back with a
real idea that they discovered in the process of trying to sell
the bad idea."<br><br>[<a name="f16n"><font color="#000000">16</font></a>]
Here's a recipe that might produce the next Facebook, if
you're college students.  If you have a connection to one of the
more powerful sororities at your school, approach the queen bees
thereof and offer to be their personal IT consultants, building
anything they could imagine needing in their social lives that
didn't already exist.  Anything that got built this way would be
very promising, because such users are not just the most demanding
but also the perfect point to spread from.<br><br>I have no idea whether this would work.<br><br>[<a name="f17n"><font color="#000000">17</font></a>]
And the reason it used a TV for a monitor is that Steve Wozniak
started out by solving his own problems.  He, like most of his
peers, couldn't afford a monitor.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Mike Arrington, Paul Buchheit, John Collison,

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><div><div><div></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></div><div><br><br><div><h1 id="invtrend">Startup Investing Trends</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">June 2013<br><br><i>(This talk was written for an audience of investors.)</i><br><br>Y Combinator has now funded 564 startups including the current
batch, which has 53.  The total valuation of the 287 that have
valuations (either by raising an equity round, getting acquired,
or dying) is about $11.7 billion, and the 511 prior to the current
batch have collectively raised about $1.7 billion.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>As usual those numbers are dominated by a few big winners.  The top
10 startups account for 8.6 of that 11.7 billion.  But there is a
peloton of younger startups behind them.  There are about 40 more
that have a shot at being really big.<br><br>Things got a little out of hand last summer when we had 84 companies
in the batch, so we tightened up our filter to decrease the batch
size. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Several journalists have tried to interpret that as
evidence for some macro story they were telling, but the reason had
nothing to do with any external trend.  The reason was that we
discovered we were using an n² algorithm, and we needed to buy
time to fix it.  Fortunately we've come up with several techniques
for sharding YC, and the problem now seems to be fixed.  With a new
more scaleable model and only 53 companies, the current batch feels
like a walk in the park.  I'd guess we can grow another 2 or 3x
before hitting the next bottleneck. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>One consequence of funding such a large number of startups is that
we see trends early.  And since fundraising is one of the main
things we help startups with, we're in a good position to notice
trends in investing.<br><br>I'm going to take a shot at describing where these trends are
leading.  Let's start with the most basic question: will the future
be better or worse than the past?  Will investors, in the aggregate,
make more money or less?<br><br>I think more.  There are multiple forces at work, some of which
will decrease returns, and some of which will increase them.  I
can't predict for sure which forces will prevail, but I'll describe
them and you can decide for yourself.<br><br>There are two big forces driving change in startup funding: it's
becoming cheaper to start a startup, and startups are becoming a
more normal thing to do.<br><br>When I graduated from college in 1986, there were essentially two
options: get a job or go to grad school.  Now there's a third: start
your own company.
That's a big change.  In principle it was possible to start your
own company in 1986 too, but it didn't seem like a real possibility.
It seemed possible to start a consulting company, or a niche product
company, but it didn't seem possible to start a company that would
become big.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>That kind of change, from 2 paths to 3, is the sort of big social
shift that only happens once every few generations.  I think we're
still at the beginning of this one.  It's hard to predict how big
a deal it will be.  As big a deal as the Industrial Revolution?
Maybe.  Probably not.  But it will be a big enough deal that it
takes almost everyone by surprise, because those big social shifts
always do.<br><br>One thing we can say for sure is that there will be a lot more
startups.  The monolithic, hierarchical companies of the mid 20th
century are being <a href="highres.html">replaced</a> by networks
of smaller companies.  This process is not just something happening
now in Silicon Valley.  It started decades ago, and it's happening
as far afield as the car industry.  It has a long way to run. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>
The other big driver of change is that startups are becoming cheaper
to start.  And in fact the two forces are related: the decreasing
cost of starting a startup is one of the reasons startups are
becoming a more normal thing to do.<br><br>The fact that startups need less money means founders will increasingly
have the upper hand over investors.  You still need just as much
of their energy and imagination, but they don't need as much of
your money.  Because founders have the upper hand, they'll retain
an increasingly large share of the stock in, and <a href="control.html">control of</a>, their
companies.  Which means investors will get less stock and less
control.<br><br>Does that mean investors will make less money?  Not necessarily,
because there will be more good startups.  The total amount of
desirable startup stock available to investors will probably increase,
because the number of desirable startups will probably grow faster
than the percentage they sell to investors shrinks.<br><br>There's a rule of thumb in the VC business that there are about 15
companies a year that will be really successful.  Although a lot
of investors unconsciously treat this number as if it were some
sort of cosmological constant, I'm certain it isn't.   There are
probably limits on the rate at which technology can develop, but
that's not the limiting factor now.  If it were, each successful
startup would be founded the month it became possible, and that is
not the case. Right now the limiting factor on the number of big
hits is the number of sufficiently good founders starting companies,
and that number can and will increase.  There are still a lot of
people who'd make great founders who never end up starting a company.
You can see that from how randomly some of the most successful
startups got started.  So many of the biggest startups almost didn't
happen that there must be a lot of equally good startups that
actually didn't happen.<br><br>There might be 10x or even 50x more good founders out there.  As
more of them go ahead and start startups, those 15 big hits a year
could easily become 50 or even 100.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>What about returns, though?  Are we heading for a world in which
returns will be pinched by increasingly high valuations?  I think
the top firms will actually make more money than they have in the
past.  High returns don't come from investing at low valuations.
They come from investing in the companies that do really well.  So
if there are more of those to be had each year, the best pickers
should have more hits.<br><br>This means there should be more variability in the VC business.
The firms that can recognize and attract the best startups will do
even better, because there will be more of them to recognize and
attract.  Whereas the bad firms will get the leftovers, as they do
now, and yet pay a higher price for them.<br><br>Nor do I think it will be a problem that founders keep control of
their companies for longer.  The empirical evidence on that is
already clear: investors make more money as founders' bitches than
their bosses.  Though somewhat humiliating, this is actually good
news for investors, because it takes less time to serve founders
than to micromanage them.<br><br>What about angels?  I think there is a lot of opportunity there.
It used to suck to be an angel investor.  You couldn't get access
to the best deals, unless you got lucky like Andy Bechtolsheim, and
when you did invest in a startup, VCs might try to strip you of
your stock when they arrived later.  Now an angel can go to something
like Demo Day or AngelList and have access to the same deals VCs
do.  And the days when VCs could wash angels out of the cap table
are long gone.<br><br>I think one of the biggest unexploited opportunities in startup
investing right now is angel-sized investments made quickly.  Few
investors understand the cost that raising money from them imposes
on startups.  When the company consists only of the founders,
everything grinds to a halt during fundraising, which can easily
take 6 weeks.  The current high cost of fundraising means there is
room for low-cost investors to undercut the rest.  And in this
context, low-cost means deciding quickly.  If there were a reputable
investor who invested $100k on good terms and promised to decide
yes or no within 24 hours, they'd get access to almost all the best
deals, because every good startup would approach them first.  It
would be up to them to pick, because every bad startup would approach
them first too, but at least they'd see everything.  Whereas if an
investor is notorious for taking a long time to make up their mind
or negotiating a lot about valuation, founders will save them for
last.  And in the case of the most promising startups, which tend
to have an easy time raising money, last can easily become never.<br><br>Will the number of big hits grow linearly with the total number of
new startups?  Probably not, for two reasons.  One is that the
scariness of starting a startup in the old days was a pretty effective
filter.  Now that the cost of failing is becoming lower, we should
expect founders to do it more.  That's not a bad thing.  It's common
in technology for an innovation that decreases the cost of failure
to increase the number of failures and yet leave you net ahead.<br><br>The other reason the number of big hits won't grow proportionately
to the number of startups is that there will start to be an increasing
number of idea clashes.  Although the finiteness of the number of
good ideas is not the reason there are only 15 big hits a year, the
number has to be finite, and the more startups there are, the more
we'll see multiple companies doing the same thing at the same time.
It will be interesting, in a bad way, if idea clashes become a lot
more common. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Mostly because of the increasing number of early failures, the startup
business of the future won't simply be the same shape, scaled up.
What used to be an obelisk will become a pyramid.  It will be a
little wider at the top, but a lot wider at the bottom.<br><br>What does that mean for investors?  One thing it means is that there
will be more opportunities for investors at the earliest stage,
because that's where the volume of our imaginary solid is growing
fastest.  Imagine the obelisk of investors that corresponds to
the obelisk of startups.  As it widens out into a pyramid to match
the startup pyramid, all the contents are adhering to the top,
leaving a vacuum at the bottom.<br><br>That opportunity for investors mostly means an opportunity for new
investors, because the degree of risk an existing investor or firm
is comfortable taking is one of the hardest things for them to
change.  Different types of investors are adapted to different
degrees of risk, but each has its specific degree of risk deeply
imprinted on it, not just in the procedures they follow but in the
personalities of the people who work there.<br><br>I think the biggest danger for VCs, and also the biggest opportunity,
is at the series A stage.  Or rather, what used to be the series A
stage before series As turned into de facto series B rounds.<br><br>Right now, VCs often knowingly invest too much money at the series
A stage.  They do it because they feel they need to get a big chunk
of each series A company to compensate for the opportunity cost of
the board seat it consumes.  Which means when there is a lot of
competition for a deal, the number that moves is the valuation (and
thus amount invested) rather than the percentage of the company
being sold.  Which means, especially in the case of more promising
startups, that series A investors often make companies take more
money than they want.<br><br>Some VCs lie and claim the company really needs that much.  Others
are more candid, and admit their financial models require them to
own a certain percentage of each company.  But we all know the
amounts being raised in series A rounds are not determined by asking
what would be best for the companies.  They're determined by VCs
starting from the amount of the company they want to own, and the
market setting the valuation and thus the amount invested.<br><br>Like a lot of bad things, this didn't happen intentionally.  The
VC business backed into it as their initial assumptions gradually
became obsolete.  The traditions and financial models of the VC
business were established when founders needed investors more.  In
those days it was natural for founders to sell VCs a big chunk of
their company in the series A round.  Now founders would prefer to
sell less, and VCs are digging in their heels because they're not
sure if they can make money buying less than 20% of each series A
company.<br><br>The reason I describe this as a danger is that series A investors
are increasingly at odds with the startups they supposedly serve,
and that tends to come back to bite you eventually.  The reason I
describe it as an opportunity is that there is now a lot of potential
energy built up, as the market has moved away from VCs' traditional
business model.  Which means the first VC to break ranks and start
to do series A rounds for as much equity as founders want to sell
(and with no "option pool" that comes only from the founders' shares)
stands to reap huge benefits.<br><br>What will happen to the VC business when that happens?  Hell if I
know.  But I bet that particular firm will end up ahead.  If one
top-tier VC firm started to do series A rounds that started from
the amount the company needed to raise and let the percentage
acquired vary with the market, instead of the other way around,
they'd instantly get almost all the best startups.  And that's where
the money is.<br><br>You can't fight market forces forever.  Over the last decade we've
seen the percentage of the company sold in series A rounds creep
inexorably downward.  40% used to be common.  Now VCs are fighting
to hold the line at 20%.  But I am daily waiting for the line to
collapse.  It's going to happen.  You may as well anticipate it,
and look bold.<br><br>Who knows, maybe VCs will make more money by doing the right thing.
It wouldn't be the first time that happened.  Venture capital is a
business where occasional big successes generate hundredfold returns.
How much confidence can you really have in financial models for
something like that anyway?  The
big successes only have to get a tiny bit less occasional to
compensate for a 2x decrease in the stock sold in series A rounds.<br><br>If you want to find new opportunities for investing, look for things
founders complain about.  Founders are your customers, and the
things they complain about are unsatisfied demand.  I've given two
examples of things founders complain about most—investors who
take too long to make up their minds, and excessive dilution in
series A rounds—so those are good places to look now.  But
the more general recipe is: do something founders want.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I realize revenue and not fundraising is the proper test of
success for a startup.  The reason we quote statistics about
fundraising is because those are the numbers we have.  We couldn't
talk meaningfully about revenues without including the numbers from
the most successful startups, and we don't have those.  We often
discuss revenue growth with the earlier stage startups, because
that's how we gauge their progress, but when companies reach a
certain size it gets presumptuous for a seed investor to do that.<br><br>In any case, companies' market caps do eventually become a function
of revenues, and post-money valuations of funding rounds are at
least guesses by pros about where those market caps will end up.<br><br>The reason only 287 have valuations is that the rest have mostly
raised money on convertible notes, and although convertible notes
often have valuation caps, a valuation cap is merely an upper bound
on a valuation.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
We didn't try to accept a particular number.  We have no way
of doing that even if we wanted to.  We just tried to be significantly
pickier.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Though you never know with bottlenecks, I'm guessing the next
one will be coordinating efforts among partners.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
I realize starting a company doesn't have to mean starting a
<a href="growth.html">startup</a>.  There will be lots of people starting normal companies
too.  But that's not relevant to an audience of investors.<br><br>Geoff Ralston reports that in Silicon Valley it seemed thinkable
to start a startup in the mid 1980s.  It would have started there.
But I know it didn't to undergraduates on the East Coast.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
This trend is one of the main causes of the increase in
economic inequality in the US since the mid twentieth century.  The
person who would in 1950 have been the general manager of the x
division of Megacorp is now the founder of the x company, and owns
significant equity in it.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
If Congress passes the <a href="foundervisa.html">founder
visa</a> in a non-broken form, that alone could in principle get
us up to 20x, since 95% of the world's population lives outside the
US.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
If idea clashes got bad enough, it could change what it means
to be a startup.  We currently advise startups mostly to ignore
competitors.  We tell them startups are competitive like running,
not like soccer; you don't have to go and steal the ball away from
the other team.  But if idea clashes became common enough, maybe
you'd start to have to.  That would be unfortunate.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Dalton Caldwell,

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
July 2013<br><br>One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is
to do things that don't scale.  A lot of would-be founders believe
that startups either take off or don't.  You build something, make
it available, and if you've made a better mousetrap, people beat a
path to your door as promised.  Or they don't, in which case the
market must not exist.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off.
There may be a handful that just grew by themselves, but usually
it takes some sort of push to get them going.  A good metaphor would
be the cranks that car engines had before they got electric starters.
Once the engine was going, it would keep going, but there was a
separate and laborious process to get it going.<br><br><b>Recruit</b><br><br>The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start
is to recruit users manually.  Nearly all startups have to.  You
can't wait for users to come to you.  You have to go out and get
them.<br><br>Stripe is one of the most successful startups we've funded, and the
problem they solved was an urgent one.   If anyone could have sat
back and waited for users, it was Stripe.  But in fact they're
famous within YC for aggressive early user acquisition.<br><br>Startups building things for other startups have a big pool of
potential users in the other companies we've funded, and none took
better advantage of it than Stripe.  At YC we use the term "Collison
installation" for the technique they invented.  More diffident
founders ask "Will you try our beta?" and if the answer is yes,
they say "Great, we'll send you a link."  But the Collison brothers
weren't going to wait. When anyone agreed to try Stripe they'd say
"Right then, give me your laptop" and set them up on the spot.<br><br>There are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting users
individually.  One is a combination of shyness and laziness.  They'd
rather sit at home writing code than go out and talk to a bunch of
strangers and probably be rejected by most of them.  But for a
startup to succeed, at least one founder (usually the CEO) will
have to spend a lot of time on sales and marketing.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The other reason founders ignore this path is that the absolute
numbers seem so small at first.  This can't be how the big, famous
startups got started, they think. The mistake they make is to
underestimate the power of compound growth.  We encourage every
startup to measure their progress by weekly <a href="growth.html">growth
rate</a>.  If you have 100 users, you need to get 10 more next week
to grow 10% a week.  And while 110 may not seem much better than
100, if you keep growing at 10% a week you'll be surprised how big
the numbers get.  After a year you'll have 14,000 users, and after
2 years you'll have 2 million.<br><br>You'll be doing different things when you're acquiring users a
thousand at a time, and growth has to slow down eventually.  But
if the market exists you can usually start by recruiting users
manually and then gradually switch to less manual methods. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Airbnb is a classic example of this technique.  Marketplaces are
so hard to get rolling that you should expect to take heroic measures
at first. In Airbnb's case, these consisted of going door to door
in New York, recruiting new users and helping existing ones improve
their listings.  When I remember the Airbnbs during YC, I picture
them with rolly bags, because when they showed up for tuesday dinners
they'd always just flown back from somewhere.<br><br><b>Fragile</b><br><br>Airbnb now seems like an unstoppable juggernaut, but early on it
was so fragile that about 30 days of going out and engaging in
person with users made the difference between success and failure.<br><br>That initial fragility was not a unique feature of Airbnb.  Almost
all startups are fragile initially.  And that's one of the biggest
things inexperienced founders and investors (and reporters and
know-it-alls on forums) get wrong about them.  They unconsciously
judge larval startups by the standards of established ones.  They're
like someone looking at a newborn baby and concluding "there's no
way this tiny creature could ever accomplish anything."<br><br>It's harmless if reporters and know-it-alls dismiss your startup.
They always get things wrong.   It's even ok if investors dismiss
your startup; they'll change their minds when they see growth.  The
big danger is that you'll dismiss your startup yourself.  I've seen
it happen.  I often have to encourage founders who don't see the
full potential of what they're building.  Even Bill Gates made that
mistake.  He returned to Harvard for the fall semester after starting
Microsoft.  He didn't stay long, but he wouldn't have returned at
all if he'd realized Microsoft was going to be even a fraction of
the size it turned out to be. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>The question to ask about an early stage startup is not "is this
company taking over the world?"  but "how big could this company
get if the founders did the right things?"  And the right things
often seem both laborious and inconsequential at the time. Microsoft
can't have seemed very impressive when it was just a couple guys
in Albuquerque writing Basic interpreters for a market of a few
thousand hobbyists (as they were then called), but in retrospect
that was the optimal path to dominating microcomputer software.
And I know Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia didn't feel like they were
en route to the big time as they were taking "professional" photos
of their first hosts' apartments.  They were just trying to survive.
But in retrospect that too was the optimal path to dominating a big
market.<br><br>How do you find users to recruit manually?  If you build something
to solve <a href="startupideas.html">your own problems</a>, then
you only have to find your peers, which is usually straightforward.
Otherwise you'll have to make a more deliberate effort to locate
the most promising vein of users.  The usual way to do that is to
get some initial set of users by doing a comparatively untargeted
launch, and then to observe which kind seem most enthusiastic, and
seek out more like them.  For example, Ben Silbermann noticed that
a lot of the earliest Pinterest users were interested in design,
so he went to a conference of design bloggers to recruit users, and
that worked well. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Delight</b><br><br>You should take extraordinary measures not just to acquire users,
but also to make them happy.  For as long as they could (which
turned out to be surprisingly long), Wufoo sent each new user a
hand-written thank you note.  Your first users should feel that
signing up with you was one of the best choices they ever made.
And you in turn should be racking your brains to think of new ways
to delight them.<br><br>Why do we have to teach startups this?  Why is it counterintuitive
for founders?  Three reasons, I think.<br><br>One is that a lot of startup founders are trained as engineers,
and customer service is not part of the training of engineers.
You're supposed to build things that are robust and elegant, not
be slavishly attentive to individual users like some kind of
salesperson.  Ironically, part of the reason engineering is
traditionally averse to handholding is that its traditions date
from a time when engineers were less powerful — when they were
only in charge of their narrow domain of building things, rather
than running the whole show.  You can be ornery when you're Scotty,
but not when you're Kirk.<br><br>Another reason founders don't focus enough on individual customers
is that they worry it won't scale.  But when founders of larval
startups worry about this, I point out that in their current state
they have nothing to lose.  Maybe if they go out of their way to
make existing users super happy, they'll one day have too many to
do so much for.  That would be a great problem to have.  See if you
can make it happen.  And incidentally, when it does, you'll find
that delighting customers scales better than you expected.  Partly
because you can usually find ways to make anything scale more than
you would have predicted, and partly because delighting customers
will by then have permeated your culture.<br><br>I have never once seen a startup lured down a blind alley by trying
too hard to make their initial users happy.<br><br>But perhaps the biggest thing preventing founders from realizing
how attentive they could be to their users is that they've never
experienced such attention themselves.  Their standards for customer
service have been set by the companies they've been customers of,
which are mostly big ones.  Tim Cook doesn't send you a hand-written
note after you buy a laptop.  He can't.  But you can.  That's one
advantage of being small: you can provide a level of service no big
company can. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Once you realize that existing conventions are not the upper bound
on user experience, it's interesting in a very pleasant way to think
about how far you could go to delight your users.<br><br><b>Experience</b><br><br>I was trying to think of a phrase to convey how extreme your attention
to users should be, and I realized Steve Jobs had already done it:
insanely great.  Steve wasn't just using "insanely" as a synonym
for "very."  He meant it more literally — that one should focus
on quality of execution to a degree that in everyday life would be
considered pathological.<br><br>All the most successful startups we've funded have, and that probably
doesn't surprise would-be founders.  What novice founders don't get
is what insanely great translates to in a larval startup.  When
Steve Jobs started using that phrase, Apple was already an established
company.  He meant the Mac (and its documentation and even
packaging — such is the nature of obsession) should be insanely
well designed and manufactured.  That's not hard for engineers to
grasp.  It's just a more extreme version of designing a robust and
elegant product.<br><br>What founders have a hard time grasping (and Steve himself might
have had a hard time grasping) is what insanely great morphs into
as you roll the time slider back to the first couple months of a
startup's life.  It's not the product that should be insanely great,
but the experience of being your user.  The product is just one
component of that.  For a big company it's necessarily the dominant
one.  But you can and should give users an insanely great experience
with an early, incomplete, buggy product, if you make up the
difference with attentiveness.<br><br>Can, perhaps, but should?  Yes.  Over-engaging with early users is
not just a permissible technique for getting growth rolling.  For
most successful startups it's a necessary part of the feedback loop
that makes the product good.  Making a better mousetrap is not an
atomic operation.  Even if you start the way most successful startups
have, by building something you yourself need, the first thing you
build is never quite right.  And except in domains with big penalties
for making mistakes, it's often better not to aim for perfection
initially.  In software, especially, it usually works best to get
something in front of users as soon as it has a quantum of utility,
and then see what they do with it.  Perfectionism is often an excuse
for procrastination, and in any case your initial model of users
is always inaccurate, even if you're one of them. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>The feedback you get from engaging directly with your earliest users
will be the best you ever get.  When you're so big you have to
resort to focus groups, you'll wish you could go over to your users'
homes and offices and watch them use your stuff like you did when
there were only a handful of them.<br><br><b>Fire</b><br><br>Sometimes the right unscalable trick is to focus on a deliberately
narrow market.  It's like keeping a fire contained at first to get
it really hot before adding more logs.<br><br>That's what Facebook did.  At first it was just for Harvard students.
In that form it only had a potential market of a few thousand people,
but because they felt it was really for them, a critical mass of
them signed up.  After Facebook stopped being for Harvard students,
it remained for students at specific colleges for quite a while.
When I interviewed Mark Zuckerberg at Startup School, he said that
while it was a lot of work creating course lists for each school,
doing that made students feel the site was their natural home.<br><br>Any startup that could be described as a marketplace usually has
to start in a subset of the market, but this can work for other
startups as well.  It's always worth asking if there's a subset of
the market in which you can get a critical mass of users quickly.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>Most startups that use the contained fire strategy do it unconsciously.
They build something for themselves and their friends, who happen
to be the early adopters, and only realize later that they could
offer it to a broader market.  The strategy works just as well if
you do it unconsciously.  The biggest danger of not being consciously
aware of this pattern is for those who naively discard part of it.
E.g. if you don't build something for yourself and your friends,
or even if you do, but you come from the corporate world and your
friends are not early adopters, you'll no longer have a perfect
initial market handed to you on a platter.<br><br>Among companies, the best early adopters are usually other startups.
They're more open to new things both by nature and because, having
just been started, they haven't made all their choices yet.  Plus
when they succeed they grow fast, and you with them.  It was one
of many unforeseen advantages of the YC model (and specifically of
making YC big) that B2B startups now have an instant market of
hundreds of other startups ready at hand.<br><br><b>Meraki</b><br><br>For <a href="hw.html">hardware startups</a> there's a variant of
doing things that don't scale that we call "pulling a Meraki."
Although we didn't fund Meraki, the founders were Robert Morris's
grad students, so we know their history.  They got started by doing
something that really doesn't scale: assembling their routers
themselves.<br><br>Hardware startups face an obstacle that software startups don't.
The minimum order for a factory production run is usually several
hundred thousand dollars.  Which can put you in a catch-22: without
a product you can't generate the growth you need to raise the money
to manufacture your product.  Back when hardware startups had to
rely on investors for money, you had to be pretty convincing to
overcome this.  The arrival of crowdfunding (or more precisely,
preorders) has helped a lot.  But even so I'd advise startups to
pull a Meraki initially if they can.  That's what Pebble did.  The
Pebbles 
<a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/eric.jpg?t=1730199416&amp;">assembled</a>
 the first several hundred watches themselves. If
they hadn't gone through that phase, they probably wouldn't have
sold $10 million worth of watches when they did go on Kickstarter.<br><br>Like paying excessive attention to early customers, fabricating
things yourself turns out to be valuable for hardware startups.
You can tweak the design faster when you're the factory, and you
learn things you'd never have known otherwise.  Eric Migicovsky of
Pebble said one of the things he learned was "how valuable it was to
source good screws."   Who knew?<br><br><b>Consult</b><br><br>Sometimes we advise founders of B2B startups to take over-engagement
to an extreme, and to pick a single user and act as if they were
consultants building something just for that one user.   The initial
user serves as the form for your mold; keep tweaking till you fit
their needs perfectly, and you'll usually find you've made something
other users want too.  Even if there aren't many of them, there are
probably adjacent territories that have more.  As long as you can
find just one user who really needs something and can act on that
need, you've got a toehold in making something people want, and
that's as much as any startup needs initially. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>Consulting is the canonical example of work that doesn't scale.
But (like other ways of bestowing one's favors liberally) it's safe
to do it so long as you're not being paid to.  That's where companies
cross the line.  So long as you're a product company that's merely
being extra attentive to a customer, they're very grateful even if
you don't solve all their problems.  But when they start paying you
specifically for that attentiveness — when they start paying
you by the hour — they expect you to do everything.<br><br>Another consulting-like technique for recruiting initially lukewarm
users is to use your software yourselves on their behalf.  We
did that at Viaweb.  When we approached merchants asking if they
wanted to use our software to make online stores, some said no, but
they'd let us make one for them.  Since we would do anything to get
users, we did.  We felt pretty lame at the time.  Instead of
organizing big strategic e-commerce partnerships, we were trying
to sell luggage and pens and men's shirts.  But in retrospect it
was exactly the right thing to do, because it taught us how it would
feel to merchants to use our software.  Sometimes the feedback loop
was near instantaneous: in the middle of building some merchant's
site I'd find I needed a feature we didn't have, so I'd spend a
couple hours implementing it and then resume building the site.<br><br><b>Manual</b><br><br>There's a more extreme variant where you don't just use your software,
but are your software.  When you only have a small number of users,
you can sometimes get away with doing by hand things that you plan
to automate later.  This lets you launch faster, and when you do
finally automate yourself out of the loop, you'll know exactly what
to build because you'll have muscle memory from doing it yourself.<br><br>When manual components look to the user like software, this technique
starts to have aspects of a practical joke.  For example, the way
Stripe delivered "instant" merchant accounts to its first users was
that the founders manually signed them up for traditional merchant
accounts behind the scenes.<br><br>Some startups could be entirely manual at first. If you can find
someone with a problem that needs solving and you can solve it
manually, go ahead and do that for as long as you can, and then
gradually automate the bottlenecks.  It would be a little frightening
to be solving users' problems in a way that wasn't yet automatic,
but less frightening than the far more common case of having something
automatic that doesn't yet solve anyone's problems.<br><br><b>Big</b><br><br>I should mention one sort of initial tactic that usually doesn't
work: the Big Launch.  I occasionally meet founders who seem to
believe startups are projectiles rather than powered aircraft, and
that they'll make it big if and only if they're launched with
sufficient initial velocity.  They want to launch simultaneously
in 8 different publications, with embargoes.  And on a tuesday, of
course, since they read somewhere that's the optimum day to launch
something.<br><br>It's easy to see how little launches matter.  Think of some successful
startups.  How many of their launches do you remember?
All you need from a launch is some initial core of users.  How well
you're doing a few months later will depend more on how happy you
made those users than how many there were of them.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>So why do founders think launches matter?  A combination of solipsism
and laziness.  They think what they're building is so great that
everyone who hears about it will immediately sign up.  Plus it would
be so much less work if you could get users merely by broadcasting
your existence, rather than recruiting them one at a time.  But
even if what you're building really is great, getting users will
always be a gradual process — partly because great things
are usually also novel, but mainly because users have other things
to think about.<br><br>Partnerships too usually don't work.  They don't work for startups
in general, but they especially don't work as a way to get growth
started.  It's a common mistake among inexperienced founders to
believe that a partnership with a big company will be their big
break.  Six months later they're all saying the same thing: that
was way more work than we expected, and we ended up getting practically
nothing out of it. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>It's not enough just to do something extraordinary initially.  You
have to make an extraordinary <i>effort</i> initially.  Any strategy
that omits the effort — whether it's expecting a big launch to
get you users, or a big partner — is ipso facto suspect.<br><br><b>Vector</b><br><br>The need to do something unscalably laborious to get started is so
nearly universal that it might be a good idea to stop thinking of
startup ideas as scalars.  Instead we should try thinking of them
as pairs of what you're going to build, plus the unscalable thing(s)
you're going to do initially to get the company going.<br><br>It could be interesting to start viewing startup ideas this way,
because now that there are two components you can try to be imaginative
about the second as well as the first.  But in most cases the second
component will be what it usually is — recruit users manually
and give them an overwhelmingly good experience — and the main
benefit of treating startups as vectors will be to remind founders
they need to work hard in two dimensions.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>In the best case, both components of the vector contribute to your
company's DNA: the unscalable things you have to do to get started
are not merely a necessary evil, but change the company permanently
for the better.  If you have to be aggressive about user acquisition
when you're small, you'll probably still be aggressive when you're
big.  If you have to manufacture your own hardware, or use your
software on users's behalf, you'll learn things you couldn't have
learned otherwise.  And most importantly, if you have to work hard
to delight users when you only have a handful of them, you'll keep
doing it when you have a lot.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Actually Emerson never mentioned mousetraps specifically.  He
wrote "If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell,
or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs,
than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his
house, though it be in the woods."<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Thanks to Sam Altman for suggesting I make this explicit.
And no, you can't avoid doing sales by hiring someone to do it for
you.  You have to do sales yourself initially.  Later you can hire
a real salesperson to replace you.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The reason this works is that as you get bigger, your size

its own momentum."<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]

If you're building something for which you can't easily get
a small set of users to observe — e.g. enterprise software — and
in a domain where you have no connections, you'll have to rely on
cold calls and introductions.  But should you even be working on
such an idea?<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Garry Tan pointed out an interesting trap founders fall into
in the beginning.  They want so much to seem big that they imitate
even the flaws of big companies, like indifference to individual
users.  This seems to them more "professional."  Actually it's
better to embrace the fact that you're small and use whatever
advantages that brings.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Your user model almost couldn't be perfectly accurate, because
users' needs often change in response to what you build for them.
Build them a microcomputer, and suddenly they need to run spreadsheets
on it, because the arrival of your new microcomputer causes someone
to invent the spreadsheet.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
If you have to choose between the subset that will sign up
quickest and those that will pay the most, it's usually best to
pick the former, because those are probably the early adopters.
They'll have a better influence on your product, and they won't
make you expend as much effort on sales.  And though they have less
money, you don't need that much to maintain your target growth rate
early on.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Yes, I can imagine cases where you could end up making
something that was really only useful for one user.  But those are
usually obvious, even to inexperienced founders.  So if it's not
obvious you'd be making something for a market of one, don't worry
about that danger.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
There may even be an inverse correlation between launch
magnitude and success.  The only launches I remember are famous
flops like the Segway and Google Wave.  Wave is a particularly
alarming example, because I think it was actually a great idea that
was killed partly by its overdone launch.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]

It will also remind founders that an idea where the second
component is empty — an idea where there is nothing you can do
to get going, e.g. because you have no way to find users to recruit
