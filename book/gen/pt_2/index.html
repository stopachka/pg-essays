There are
two ways to do it: give money to the poor, or take it away from the 
rich.  But they amount to the same thing, because if you want to
give money to the poor, you have to get it from somewhere.  You
can't get it from the poor, or they just end up where they started.
You have to get it from the rich.<br><br>There is of course a way to make the poor richer without simply
shifting money from the rich.  You could help the poor become more
productive — for example, by improving access to education.  Instead
of taking money from engineers and giving it to checkout clerks,
you could enable people who would have become checkout clerks to
become engineers.<br><br>This is an excellent strategy for making the poor richer.  But the
evidence of the last 200 years shows that it doesn't reduce economic
inequality, because it makes the rich richer too.  If there
are more engineers, then there are more opportunities to hire them
and to sell them things.  Henry Ford couldn't have made a fortune  
building cars in a society in which most people were still subsistence
farmers; he would have had neither workers nor customers.<br><br>If you want to reduce economic inequality instead of just improving
the overall standard of living, it's not enough just to raise up  
the poor.  What if one of your newly minted engineers gets ambitious
and goes on to become another Bill Gates?  Economic inequality will
be as bad as ever.  If you actually want to compress the gap between
rich and poor, you have to push down on the top as well as pushing
up on the bottom.<br><br>How do you push down on the top?  You could try to decrease the
productivity of the people who make the most money: make the best   
surgeons operate with their left hands, force popular actors to
overeat, and so on.  But this approach is hard to implement.  The
only practical solution is to let people do the best work they can,
and then (either by taxation or by limiting what they can charge)
to confiscate whatever you deem to be surplus.<br><br>So let's be clear what reducing economic inequality means.  It is   
identical with taking money from the rich.<br><br>When you transform a mathematical expression into another form, you
often notice new things.  So it is in this case.  Taking money from
the rich turns out to have consequences one might not foresee when
one phrases the same idea in terms of "reducing inequality."<br><br>The problem is, risk and reward have to be proportionate.  A bet  
with only a 10% chance of winning has to pay more than one with a
50% chance of winning, or no one will take it.  So if you lop off
the top of the possible rewards, you thereby decrease people's
willingness to take risks.<br><br>Transposing into our original expression, we get: decreasing economic
inequality means decreasing the risk people are willing to take.<br><br>There are whole classes of risks that are no longer worth taking    
if the maximum return is decreased.  One reason high tax rates are
disastrous is that this class of risks includes starting new
companies.<br><br><b>Investors</b><br><br>Startups are intrinsically risky.  A startup
is like a small boat
in the open sea.  One big wave and you're sunk.  A competing product,
a downturn in the economy, a delay in getting funding or regulatory
approval, a patent suit, changing technical standards, the departure
of a key employee, the loss of a big account — any one of these can
destroy you overnight.  It seems only about 1 in 10 startups succeeds.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Our startup paid its first round of outside investors 36x.  Which   
meant, with current US tax rates, that it made sense to invest in
us if we had better than a 1 in 24 chance of succeeding.  That  
sounds about right.  That's probably roughly how we looked when we
were a couple of nerds with no business experience operating out
of an apartment.<br><br>If that kind of risk doesn't pay, venture investing, as we know it,
doesn't happen.<br><br>That might be ok if there were other sources of capital for new
companies.  Why not just have the government, or some large
almost-government organization like Fannie Mae, do the venture
investing instead of private funds?<br><br>I'll tell you why that wouldn't work. Because then you're asking
government or almost-government employees to do the one thing they 
are least able to do: take risks.<br><br>As anyone who has worked for the government knows, the important
thing is not to make the right choices, but to make choices that
can be justified later if they fail.  If there is a safe option,
that's the one a bureaucrat will choose.   But that is exactly the  
wrong way to do venture investing.  The nature of the business means
that you want to make terribly risky choices, if the upside looks
good enough.<br><br>VCs are currently 
<a href="venturecapital.html">paid</a> in a way that makes them 
focus on the upside:
they get a percentage of the fund's gains.  And that helps overcome
their understandable fear of investing in a company run by nerds
who look like (and perhaps are) college students.<br><br>If VCs weren't allowed to get rich, they'd behave like bureaucrats.
Without hope of gain, they'd have only fear of loss.  And so they'd
make the wrong choices.  They'd turn down the nerds in favor of the
smooth-talking MBA in a suit, because that investment would be
easier to justify later if it failed.<br><br><b>Founders</b><br><br>But even if you could somehow redesign venture funding to work
without allowing VCs to become rich, there's another kind of investor
you simply cannot replace: the startups' founders and early employees.<br><br>What they invest is their time and ideas.  But these are equivalent
to money; the proof is that investors are willing (if forced) to
treat them as interchangeable, granting the same status to "sweat   
equity" and the equity they've purchased with cash.<br><br>The fact that you're investing time doesn't change the relationship
between risk and reward.  If you're going to invest your time in
something with a small chance of succeeding, you'll only do it if
there is a proportionately large payoff.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>
If large payoffs aren't allowed, you may as well play it safe.<br><br>Like many startup founders, I did it to get rich.  But not because 
I wanted to buy expensive things.  What I wanted was security.  I   
wanted to make enough money that I didn't have to worry about money.
If I'd been forbidden to make enough from a startup to do this, I
would have sought security by some other means: for example, by
going to work for a big, stable organization from which it would
be hard to get fired.  Instead of busting my ass in a startup, I    
would have tried to get a nice, low-stress job at a big research 
lab, or tenure at a university.<br><br>That's what everyone does in societies where risk isn't rewarded.
If you can't ensure your own security, the next best thing is to
make a nest for yourself in some large organization where your
status depends mostly on <a href="ladder.html">seniority</a>.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Even if we could somehow replace investors, I don't see how we could
replace founders.  Investors mainly contribute money, which in
principle is the same no matter what the source.  But the founders
contribute ideas.  You can't replace those.<br><br>Let's rehearse the chain of argument so far.  I'm heading for a 
conclusion to which many readers will have to be dragged kicking   
and screaming, so I've tried to make each link unbreakable.  Decreasing
economic inequality means taking money from the rich.  Since risk
and reward are equivalent, decreasing potential rewards automatically
decreases people's appetite for risk.  Startups are intrinsically
risky.  Without the prospect of rewards proportionate to the risk,
founders will not invest their time in a startup.  Founders are
irreplaceable.  So eliminating economic inequality means eliminating
startups.<br><br>Economic inequality is not just a consequence of startups.
It's the engine that drives them, in the same way a fall of water   
drives a water mill.  People start startups in the hope of becoming
much richer than they were before.  And if your society tries to
prevent anyone from being much richer than anyone else, it will
also prevent one person from being much richer at t2 than t1.<br><br><b>Growth</b><br><br>This argument applies proportionately.  It's not just that if you  
eliminate economic inequality, you get no startups.  To the extent 
you reduce economic inequality, you decrease the number of startups.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
Increase taxes, and willingness to take risks decreases in
proportion.<br><br>And that seems bad for everyone.  New technology and new jobs both
come disproportionately from new companies.  Indeed, if you don't
have startups, pretty soon you won't have established companies
either, just as, if you stop having kids, pretty soon you won't
have any adults.<br><br>It sounds benevolent to say we ought to reduce economic inequality. 
When you phrase it that way, who can argue with you?  <i>Inequality</i>
has to be bad, right?  It sounds a good deal less benevolent to say
we ought to reduce the rate at which new companies are founded.
And yet the one implies the other.<br><br>Indeed, it may be that reducing investors' appetite for risk doesn't
merely kill off larval startups, but kills off the most promising
ones especially.  Startups yield faster growth at greater risk than
established companies.  Does this trend also hold among startups?
That is, are the riskiest startups the ones that generate most
growth if they succeed?  I suspect the answer is yes.  And that's   
a chilling thought, because it means that if you cut investors'
appetite for risk, the most beneficial startups are the first to 
go.<br><br>Not all rich people got that way from startups, of course.  What
if we let people get rich by starting startups, but taxed away all
other surplus wealth?  Wouldn't that at least decrease inequality?<br><br>Less than you might think.  If you made it so that people could
only get rich by starting startups, people who wanted to get rich
would all start startups.  And that might be a great thing.  But I
don't think it would have much effect on the distribution of wealth.
People who want to get rich will do whatever they have to.  If
startups are the only way to do it, you'll just get far more people
starting startups.  (If you write the laws very carefully, that is.
More likely, you'll just get a lot of people doing things that can
be made to look on paper like startups.)<br><br>If we're determined to eliminate economic inequality, there is still
one way out: we could say that we're willing to go ahead and do
without startups.  What would happen if we did?<br><br>At a minimum, we'd have to accept lower rates of technological   
growth.  If you believe that large, established companies could   
somehow be made to develop new technology as fast as startups, the
ball is in your court to explain how.  (If you can come up with a   
remotely plausible story, you can make a fortune writing business
books and consulting for large companies.)
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Ok, so we get slower growth.  Is that so bad?  Well, one reason
it's bad in practice is that other countries might not agree to
slow down with us.  If you're content to develop new technologies
at a slower rate than the rest of the world, what happens is that
you don't invent anything at all.  Anything you might discover has
already been invented elsewhere.  And the only thing you can offer 
in return is raw materials and cheap labor.  Once you sink that
low, other countries can do whatever they like with you: install
puppet governments, siphon off your best workers, use your women
as prostitutes, dump their toxic waste on your territory — all the
things we do to poor countries now.  The only defense is to isolate
yourself, as communist countries did in the twentieth century.  But
the problem then is, you have to become a police state to enforce 
it.
<!-- Eliminating economic inequality means eliminating startups, and to
the extent you do that, you're hosed. --><br><br><b>Wealth and Power</b><br><br>I realize startups are not the main target of those who want to
eliminate economic inequality.   What they really dislike is the
sort of wealth that becomes self-perpetuating through an alliance
with power. For example, construction firms that fund politicians'
campaigns in return for government contracts, or rich parents who   
get their children into good colleges by sending them to expensive
schools designed for that purpose.  But if you try to attack this type of wealth
through <i>economic</i> policy, it's hard to hit without destroying
startups as collateral damage.<br><br>The problem here is not wealth, but corruption.  So why not go after
corruption?<br><br>We don't need to prevent people from being rich if we can prevent
wealth from translating into power.  And there has been progress
on that front.  Before he died of drink in 1925, Commodore Vanderbilt's
wastrel grandson Reggie ran down pedestrians on five separate   
occasions, killing two of them.  By 1969, when Ted Kennedy drove  
off the bridge at Chappaquiddick, the limit seemed to be down to  
one.  Today it may well be zero.  But what's changed is not variation
in wealth.  What's changed is the ability to translate wealth into
power.<br><br>How do you break the connection between wealth and power?  Demand   
transparency.  Watch closely how power is exercised, and demand an
account of how decisions are made.  Why aren't all police interrogations
videotaped?  Why did 36% of Princeton's class of 2007 come from
prep schools, when only 1.7% of American kids attend them?  Why did
the US really invade Iraq?  Why don't government officials disclose
more about their finances, and why only during their term of office?<br><br>A friend of mine who knows a lot about computer security says the
single most important step is to log everything.  Back when he was
a kid trying to break into computers, what worried him most was the
idea of leaving a trail.  He was more inconvenienced by the need 
to avoid that than by any obstacle deliberately put in his path.<br><br>Like all illicit connections, the connection between wealth and     
power flourishes in secret.  Expose all transactions, and you will
greatly reduce it.  Log everything.  That's a strategy that already
seems to be working, and it doesn't have the side effect of making
your whole country poor.<br><br>I don't think many people realize there is a connection between
economic inequality and risk.  I didn't fully grasp it till recently.
I'd known for years of course that if one didn't score in a startup,
the other alternative was to get a cozy, tenured research job.  But
I didn't understand the equation governing my behavior.  Likewise, 
it's obvious empirically that a country that doesn't let people get
rich is headed for disaster, whether it's Diocletian's Rome or  
Harold Wilson's Britain.  But I did not till recently understand
the role risk played.<br><br>If you try to attack wealth, you end up nailing risk as well, and  
with it growth.  If we want a fairer world, I think we're better  
off attacking one step downstream, where wealth turns into power.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>
[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Success here is defined from the initial investors' point of
view: either an IPO, or an acquisition for more than the valuation
at the last round of funding.  The conventional 1 in 10 success rate
is suspiciously neat, but conversations with VCs suggest it's roughly
correct for startups overall.  Top VC firms expect to do better.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
I'm not claiming founders sit down and calculate the expected     
after-tax return from a startup.  They're motivated by examples of
other people who did it.  And those examples do reflect after-tax returns.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Conjecture: The variation in wealth in a (non-corrupt) 
country or organization
will be inversely proportional to the prevalence of systems of
seniority.  So if you suppress variation in wealth, seniority will
become correspondingly more important.  So far, I know of no
counterexamples, though in very corrupt countries you may get 
both simultaneously.  (Thanks to Daniel Sobral for pointing
this out.)<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
In a country with a truly feudal economy, you might be able to
redistribute wealth successfully, because there are no startups to
kill.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
The speed at which startups develop new techology is the other     
reason they pay so well.  As I explained in <a href="wealth.html">"How to Make Wealth"</a>, what you do in a startup is compress a
lifetime's worth of work into a few years.  It seems as
dumb to discourage that as to discourage risk-taking.<br><br>

We were
surprised how well it went.  Overall only about 10% of startups   
succeed, but if I had to guess now, I'd predict three or four of  
the eight startups we funded will make it.<br><br>Of the startups that needed further funding, I believe all have
either closed a round or are likely to soon.  Two have already
turned down (lowball) acquisition offers.<br><br>We would have been happy if just one of the eight seemed promising
by the end of the summer.  What's going on?  Did some kind of anomaly
make this summer's applicants especially good?  We worry about that,
but we can't think of one.  We'll find out this <xa href="http://ycombinator.com/wfp2006.html">winter.<br><br>The whole summer was full of surprises.  The best was that the <a href="hiring.html">hypothesis</a> we were testing seems to be
correct.  Young hackers can start viable companies.  This is good
news for two reasons: (a) it's an encouraging thought, and (b) it 
means that Y Combinator, which is predicated on the idea, is not
hosed.<br><br><b>Age</b><br><br>More precisely, the hypothesis was that success in a startup depends
mainly on how smart and energetic you are, and much less on how old
you are or how much business experience you have.  The results so
far bear this out.  The 2005 summer founders ranged in age from 18  
to 28 (average 23), and there is no correlation between their ages
and how well they're doing.<br><br>This should not really be surprising. Bill Gates and Michael Dell 
were both 19 when they started the companies that made them famous.
Young founders are not a new phenomenon: the trend began as soon
as computers got cheap enough for college kids to afford them.<br><br>Another of our hypotheses was that you can start a startup on less
money than most people think.  Other investors were surprised to
hear the most we gave any group was $20,000.  But we knew it was
possible to start on that little because we started Viaweb on
$10,000.<br><br>And so it proved this summer.  Three months' funding is enough to
get into second gear.  We had a demo day for potential investors
ten weeks in, and seven of the eight groups had a prototype ready
by that time.  One, <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>, had
already launched, and were able to give a demo of their live site.<br><br>A researcher who studied the SFP startups said the one thing they 
had in common was that they all worked ridiculously hard.  People
this age are commonly seen as lazy.  I think in some cases it's not
so much that they lack the appetite for work, but that the work
they're offered is unappetizing.<br><br>The experience of the SFP suggests that if you let motivated people
do real work, they work hard, whatever their age.  As one of the
founders said "I'd read that starting a startup consumed your life,  
but I had no idea what that meant until I did it."<br><br>I'd feel guilty if I were a boss making people work this hard.  But
we're not these people's bosses.  They're working on their own
projects.  And what makes them work is not us but their competitors.
Like good athletes, they don't work hard because the coach yells
at them, but because they want to win.<br><br>We have less power than bosses, and yet the founders work harder  
than employees.  It seems like a win for everyone.  The only catch
is that we get on average only about 5-7% of the upside, while an
employer gets nearly all of it.  (We're counting on it being 5-7%
of a much larger number.)<br><br>As well as working hard, the groups all turned out to be extraordinarily
responsible.  I can't think of a time when one failed to do something
they'd promised to, even by being late for an appointment.  This
is another lesson the world has yet to learn.  One of the founders
discovered that the hardest part of arranging a meeting with
executives at a big cell phone carrier was getting a rental company
to rent him a car, because he was too young.<br><br>I think the problem here is much the same as with the apparent
laziness of people this age.  They seem lazy because the work they're
given is pointless, and they act irresponsible because they're not
given any power.  Some of them, anyway.  We only have a sample size
of about twenty, but it seems so far that if you let people in their
early twenties be their own bosses, they rise to the occasion.<br><br><b>Morale</b><br><br>The summer founders were as a rule very idealistic.  They also  
wanted very much to get rich.  These qualities might seem incompatible,
but they're not.  These guys want to get rich, but they want to do
it by changing the world.  They wouldn't (well, seven of the eight
groups wouldn't) be interested in making money by speculating in
stocks.  They want to make something people use.<br><br>I think this makes them more effective as founders.  As hard as  
people will work for money, they'll work harder for a cause.  And   
since success in a startup depends so much on motivation, the
paradoxical result is that the people likely to make the most money
are those who aren't in it just for the money.<br><br>The founders of <a href="http://kiko.com">Kiko</a>, for example,   
are working on an Ajax calendar.  They want to get rich, but they
pay more attention to design than they would if that were their
only motivation.  You can tell just by looking at it.<br><br>I never considered it till this summer, but this might be another
reason startups run by hackers tend to do better than those run by
MBAs.  Perhaps it's not just that hackers understand technology
better, but that they're driven by more powerful motivations.
Microsoft, as I've said before, is a dangerously misleading example.  
Their mean corporate culture only works for monopolies.   
Google is a better model.<br><br>Considering that the summer founders are the sharks in this ocean,
we were surprised how frightened most of them were of competitors.
But now that I think of it, we were just as frightened when we
started Viaweb.  For the first year, our initial reaction to news 
of a competitor was always: we're doomed.  Just as a hypochondriac
magnifies his symptoms till he's convinced he has some terrible
disease, when you're not used to competitors you magnify them into
monsters.<br><br>Here's a handy rule for startups: competitors are rarely as dangerous
as they seem.  Most will self-destruct before you can destroy them.
And it certainly doesn't matter how many of them there are, any
more than it matters to the winner of a marathon how many runners
are behind him.<br><br>"It's a crowded market," I remember one founder saying worriedly.<br><br>"Are you the current leader?" I asked.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Is anyone able to develop software faster than you?"<br><br>"Probably not."<br><br>"Well, if you're ahead now, and you're the fastest, then you'll
stay ahead.  What difference does it make how many others there
are?"<br><br>Another group was worried when they realized they had to rewrite
their software from scratch.  I told them it would be a bad sign
if they didn't.  The main function of your initial version is to  
be rewritten.<br><br>That's why we advise groups to ignore issues like scalability,
internationalization, and heavy-duty security at first. [1] I can
imagine an advocate of "best practices" saying these ought to be
considered from the start.  And he'd be right, except that they
interfere with the primary function of software in a startup: to  
be a vehicle for experimenting with its own design.  Having to
retrofit internationalization or scalability is a pain, certainly.  
The only bigger pain is not needing to, because your initial version
was too big and rigid to evolve into something users wanted.<br><br>I suspect this is another reason startups beat big companies.
Startups can be irresponsible and release version 1s that are light
enough to evolve.  In big companies, all the pressure is in the   
direction of over-engineering.<br><br><b>What Got Learned</b><br><br>One thing we were curious about this summer was where these groups  
would need help.  That turned out to vary a lot.  Some we helped
with technical advice-- for example, about how to set up an application
to run on multiple servers.  Most we helped with strategy questions,
like what to patent, and what to charge for and what to give away.
Nearly all wanted advice about dealing with future investors: how  
much money should they take and what kind of terms should they
expect?<br><br>However, all the groups quickly learned how to deal with stuff like
patents and investors.  These problems aren't intrinsically difficult,
just unfamiliar.<br><br>It was surprising-- slightly frightening even-- how fast they
learned.  The weekend before the demo day for investors, we had a  
practice session where all the groups gave their presentations.  
They were all terrible.  We tried to explain how to make them better,
but we didn't have much hope.  So on demo day I told the assembled
angels and VCs that these guys were hackers, not MBAs, and so while
their software was good, we should not expect slick presentations 
from them.<br><br>The groups then proceeded to give fabulously slick presentations. 
Gone were the mumbling recitations of lists of features.   It was
as if they'd spent the past week at acting school.  I still don't 
know how they did it.<br><br>Perhaps watching each others' presentations helped them see what
they'd been doing wrong.  Just as happens in college, the summer   
founders learned a lot from one another-- maybe more than they
learned from us.  A lot of the problems they face are the same,  
from dealing with investors to hacking Javascript.<br><br>I don't want to give the impression there were no problems this  
summer.  A lot went wrong, as usually happens with startups.  One
group got an "<a href="http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2003/000024.html">exploding
term-sheet</a>" from some VCs.  Pretty much all the groups who had
dealings with big companies found that big companies do everything
infinitely slowly.  (This is to be expected.  If big companies
weren't incapable, there would be no room for startups to exist.)
And of course there were the usual nightmares associated with
servers.  <!-- When Kiko's server went down after they got slashdotted,
the guy in charge of the server was in China and had to fix it from
there. --><br><br>In short, the disasters this summer were just the usual childhood
diseases.  Some of this summer's eight startups will   
probably die eventually; it would be extraordinary if all eight 
succeeded.  But what kills them will not be dramatic, external    
threats, but a mundane, internal one: not getting enough done.<br><br>So far, though, the news is all good.  In fact, we were surprised
how much fun the summer was for us.  The main reason was how much
we liked the founders.  They're so earnest and hard-working.  They
seem to like us too.  And this illustrates another advantage of
investing over hiring: our relationship with them is way better   
than it would be between a boss and an employee.  Y Combinator ends
up being more like an older brother than a parent.<br><br>I was surprised how much time I spent making introductions.
Fortunately I discovered that when a startup needed to talk to
someone, I could usually get to the right person by at most one
hop.  I remember wondering, how did my friends get to be so eminent?
and a second later realizing: shit, I'm forty.<br><br>Another surprise was that the three-month batch format,
which we were forced into by the constraints of the summer, turned
out to be an advantage.  When we started Y Combinator, we planned
to invest the way other venture firms do: as proposals came in,     
we'd evaluate them and decide yes or no.  The SFP
was just an experiment to get things started.  But it worked so
well that we plan to do 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com/funding.html">all</a> 
our investing this way, one cycle in
the summer and one in winter.  It's more efficient for us, and
better for the startups too.<br><br>Several groups said our weekly dinners saved them from a common
problem afflicting startups: working so hard that one has no social
life.  (I remember that part all too well.)  This way, they were
guaranteed a social event at least once a week.<br><br><b>Independence</b><br><br>I've heard Y Combinator described as an "incubator."  Actually we're
the opposite: incubators exert more control than ordinary VCs, and
we make a point of exerting less.  Among other things, incubators
usually make you work in their office-- that's where the 
word "incubator" comes from.  That seems the wrong model.  If
investors get too involved, they smother one of the most powerful 
forces in a startup: the feeling that it's your own company.<br><br>Incubators were conspicuous failures during the Bubble.  There's  
still debate about whether this was because of the Bubble, or because
they're a bad idea.  My vote is they're a bad idea.  I think they 
fail because they select for the wrong people.  When we were starting
a startup, we would never have taken funding from an "incubator."
We can find office space, thanks; just give us the money.  And  
people with that attitude are the ones likely to succeed in startups.<br><br>Indeed, one quality all the founders shared this summer was a spirit
of independence.  I've been wondering about that.  Are some people
just a lot more independent than others, or would everyone be this
way if they were allowed to?<br><br>As with most nature/nurture questions, the answer is probably: some
of each.  But my main conclusion from the summer is that there's
more environment in the mix than most people realize.  I could see
that from how the founders' attitudes <i>changed</i> during the   
summer.  Most were emerging from twenty or so years of being told
what to do.  They seemed a little surprised at having total freedom.
But they grew into it really quickly; some of these guys now seem
about four inches taller (metaphorically) than they did at the
beginning of the summer.<br><br>When we asked the summer founders what surprised them most about
starting a company, one said "the most shocking thing is that it 
worked."<br><br>It will take more experience to know for sure, but my guess is that
a lot of hackers could do this-- that if you put people in a position
of independence, they develop the qualities they need.  Throw them
off a cliff, and most will find on the way down that they have   
wings.<br><br>The reason this is news to anyone is that the same forces work in
the other direction too. Most hackers are 
employees, and this <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/No_Great_Hackers.html">molds</a>
you into someone to whom starting a startup seems impossible as
surely as starting a startup molds you into someone who can handle
it.<br><br>If I'm right, "hacker" will mean something different in twenty years
than it does now. Increasingly it will mean the people who run the
company.  Y Combinator is just accelerating a process that would
have happened anyway.  Power is shifting from the people who deal
with money to the people who create technology, and if our experience
this summer is any guide, this will be a good thing.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] By heavy-duty security I mean efforts to protect against truly
determined attackers.<br><br>The <a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/sfptable.jpg?t=1688221954&amp;">image</a>

<p>
October 2005<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2005 
<a href="http://startupschool.org">Startup School.</a>)</i><br><br>How do you get good ideas for 
<a href="start.html">startups</a>?  That's probably the number
one question people ask me.<br><br>I'd like to reply with another question: why do people think it's
hard to come up with ideas for startups?<br><br>That might seem a stupid thing to ask.  Why do they <i>think</i>
it's hard?  If people can't do it, then it <i>is</i> hard, at least
for them.  Right?<br><br>Well, maybe not.  What people usually say is not that they can't
think of ideas, but that they don't have any.  That's not quite the
same thing.  It could be the reason they don't have any is that
they haven't tried to generate them.<br><br>I think this is often the case.  I think people believe that coming
up with ideas for startups is very hard-- that it <i>must</i> be
very hard-- and so they don't try do to it.  They assume ideas are
like miracles: they either pop into your head or they don't.<br><br>I also have a theory about why people think this.  They overvalue
ideas.  They think creating a startup is just a matter of implementing
some fabulous initial idea.  And since a successful startup is worth
millions of dollars, a good idea is therefore a million dollar idea.<br><br>If coming up with an idea for a startup equals coming up with a
million dollar idea, then of course it's going to seem hard.  Too
hard to bother trying.  Our instincts tell us something so valuable
would not be just lying around for anyone to discover.<br><br>Actually, startup ideas are not million dollar ideas, and here's
an experiment you can try to prove it: just try to sell one.  Nothing
evolves faster than markets.  The fact that there's no market for
startup ideas suggests there's no demand.  Which means, in the
narrow sense of the word, that startup ideas are worthless.<br><br><b>Questions</b><br><br>The fact is, most startups end up nothing like the initial idea.
It would be closer to the truth to say the main value of your initial
idea is that, in the process of discovering it's broken, you'll
come up with your real idea.<br><br>The initial idea is just a starting point-- not a blueprint, but a
question.  It might help if they were expressed that way.  Instead
of saying that your idea is to make a collaborative, web-based
spreadsheet, say: could one make a collaborative, web-based
spreadsheet?  A few grammatical tweaks, and a woefully incomplete
idea becomes a promising question to explore.<br><br>There's a real difference, because an assertion provokes objections
in a way a question doesn't.  If you say: I'm going to build a
web-based spreadsheet, then critics-- the most dangerous of which
are in your own head-- will immediately reply that you'd be competing
with Microsoft, that you couldn't give people the kind of UI they
expect, that users wouldn't want to have their data on your servers,
and so on.<br><br>A question doesn't seem so challenging.  It becomes: let's try
making a web-based spreadsheet and see how far we get.  And everyone
knows that if you tried this you'd be able to make <i>something</i>
useful.  Maybe what you'd end up with wouldn't even be a spreadsheet.
Maybe it would be some kind of new spreadsheet-like collaboration
tool that doesn't even have a name yet.  You wouldn't have thought
of something like that except by implementing your way toward it.<br><br>Treating a startup idea as a question changes what you're looking
for.  If an idea is a blueprint, it has to be right.  But if it's
a question, it can be wrong, so long as it's wrong in a way that
leads to more ideas.<br><br>One valuable way for an idea to be wrong is to be only a partial
solution.  When someone's working on a problem that seems too
big, I always ask: is there some way to bite off some subset of the
problem, then gradually expand from there?  That will generally
work unless you get trapped on a local maximum, like 1980s-style
AI, or C.<br><br><b>Upwind</b><br><br>So far, we've reduced the problem from thinking of a million dollar
idea to thinking of a mistaken question.  That doesn't seem so hard,
does it?<br><br>To generate such questions you need two things: to be familiar with 
promising new technologies, and to have the right kind of friends.
New technologies are the ingredients startup ideas are made of, and
conversations with friends are the kitchen they're cooked in.<br><br>Universities have both, and that's why so many startups grow out
of them.  They're filled with new technologies, because they're
trying to produce research, and only things that are new count as
research.  And they're full of exactly the right kind of people to   
have ideas with: the other students, who will be not only smart but
elastic-minded to a fault.<br><br>The opposite extreme would be a well-paying but boring job at a big
company.  Big companies are biased against new technologies, and
the people you'd meet there would be wrong too.<br><br>In an <a href="hs.html">essay</a> I wrote for high school students,  
I said a good rule of thumb was to stay upwind-- to
work on things that maximize your future options. The principle
applies for adults too, though perhaps it has to be modified to:
stay upwind for as long as you can, then cash in the potential
energy you've accumulated when you need to pay for kids.<br><br>I don't think people consciously realize this, but one reason
downwind jobs like churning out Java for a bank pay so well is   
precisely that they are downwind.  The market price for that kind
of work is higher because it gives you fewer options for the future.
A job that lets you work on exciting new stuff will tend to pay
less, because part of the compensation is in the form of the new
skills you'll learn.<br><br>Grad school is the other end of the spectrum from a coding job at
a big company: the pay's low but you spend most of your time working
on new stuff.  And of course, it's called "school," which makes
that clear to everyone, though in fact all jobs are some percentage
school.<br><br>The right environment for having startup ideas need not be a
university per se.  It just has to be a situation with a large
percentage of school.<br><br>It's obvious why you want exposure to new technology, but why do 
you need other people?  Can't you just think of new ideas yourself?
The empirical answer is: no.  Even Einstein needed people to bounce
ideas off.  Ideas get developed in the process of explaining them
to the right kind of person.  You need that resistance, just
as a carver needs the resistance of the wood.<br><br>This is one reason Y Combinator has a rule against investing in 
startups with only one founder.  Practically every successful company
has at least two.  And because startup founders work under great   
pressure, it's critical they be friends.<br><br>I didn't realize it till I was writing this, but that may help
explain why there are so few female startup founders.  I read on
the Internet (so it must be true) that only 1.7% of VC-backed
startups are founded by women.  The percentage of female hackers
is small, but not that small.  So why the discrepancy?<br><br>When you realize that successful startups tend to have multiple
founders who were already friends, a
possible explanation emerges.  People's best friends are likely to  
be of the same sex, and if one group is a minority in some population,
<i>pairs</i> of them will be a minority squared.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Doodling</b><br><br>What these groups of co-founders do together is more complicated 
than just sitting down and trying to think of ideas.  I suspect the  
most productive setup is a kind of together-alone-together sandwich.
Together you talk about some hard problem, probably getting nowhere.
Then, the next morning, one of you has an idea in the shower about
how to solve it.  He runs eagerly to to tell the others, and together
they work out the kinks.<br><br>What happens in that shower?  It seems to me that ideas just pop
into my head.  But can we say more than that?<br><br>Taking a shower is like a form of meditation.  You're alert, but
there's nothing to distract you.  It's in a situation like this,
where your mind is free to roam, that it bumps into new ideas.<br><br>What happens when your mind wanders?  It may be like doodling.  Most
people have characteristic ways of doodling.  This habit is  
unconscious, but not random: I found my doodles changed after I 
started studying painting.  I started to make the kind of gestures
I'd make if I were drawing from life.  They were atoms of drawing,  
but arranged randomly.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Perhaps letting your mind wander is like doodling with ideas.  You
have certain mental gestures you've learned in your work, and when
you're not paying attention, you keep making these same gestures,   
but somewhat randomly.  In effect, you call the same functions on
random arguments.  That's what a metaphor is: a function applied   
to an argument of the wrong type.<br><br>Conveniently, as I was writing this, my mind wandered: would it be
useful to have metaphors in a programming language?  I don't know;
I don't have time to think about this.  But it's convenient because
this is an example of what I mean by habits of mind.  I spend a lot
of time thinking about language design, and my habit of always   
asking "would x be useful in a programming language" just got
invoked.<br><br>If new ideas arise like doodles, this would explain why you have
to work at something for a while before you have any.  It's not
just that you can't judge ideas till you're an expert in a field.
You won't even generate ideas, because you won't have any habits
of mind to invoke.<br><br>Of course the habits of mind you invoke on some field don't have
to be derived from working in that field.  In fact, it's often
better if they're not.  You're not just looking for good ideas, but
for good <i>new</i> ideas, and you have a better chance of generating
those if you combine stuff from distant fields.  As hackers, one
of our habits of mind is to ask, could one open-source x?  For  
example, what if you made an open-source operating system?  A fine
idea, but not very novel.  Whereas if you ask, could you make an
open-source play?  you might be onto something.<br><br>Are some kinds of work better sources of habits of mind than others?
I suspect harder fields may be better sources, because to attack
hard problems you need powerful solvents.  I find math is a good
source of metaphors-- good enough that it's worth studying just for
that.  Related fields are also good sources, especially when they're
related in unexpected ways.  Everyone knows computer science and
electrical engineering are related, but precisely because everyone
knows it, importing ideas from one to the other doesn't yield great
profits.  It's like importing something from Wisconsin to Michigan.  
Whereas (I claim) hacking and <a href="hp.html">painting</a> are
also related, in the sense that hackers and painters are both 
<a href="taste.html">makers</a>,
and this source of new ideas is practically virgin territory.<br><br><b>Problems</b><br><br>In theory you could stick together ideas at random and see what you
came up with.  What if you built a peer-to-peer dating site?  Would
it be useful to have an automatic book?  Could you turn theorems
into a commodity?  When you assemble ideas at random like this, 
they may not be just stupid, but semantically ill-formed.  What 
would it even mean to make theorems a commodity?  You got me.  I
didn't think of that idea, just its name.<br><br>You might come up with something useful this way, but I never have.
It's like knowing a fabulous sculpture is hidden inside a block of
marble, and all you have to do is remove the marble that isn't part
of it.  It's an encouraging thought, because it reminds you there   
is an answer, but it's not much use in practice because the search
space is too big.<br><br>I find that to have good ideas I need to be working on some problem.
You can't start with randomness.  You have to start with a problem,
then let your mind wander just far enough for new ideas to form.<br><br>In a way, it's harder to see problems than their solutions.  Most  
people prefer to remain in denial about problems.  It's obvious
why: problems are irritating.  They're problems!  Imagine if people
in 1700 saw their lives the way we'd see them.  It would have been
unbearable.  This denial is such a powerful force that, even when 
presented with possible solutions, people often prefer to believe
they wouldn't work.<br><br>I saw this phenomenon when I worked on spam filters.  In 2002, most
people preferred to ignore spam, and most of those who didn't
preferred to believe the heuristic filters then available were the
best you could do.<br><br>I found spam intolerable, and I felt it had to be possible to
recognize it statistically.  And it turns out that was all you  
needed to solve the problem.  The algorithm I used was ridiculously
simple.  Anyone who'd really tried to solve the problem would have
found it.  It was just that no one had really tried to solve the
problem.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Let me repeat that recipe: finding the problem intolerable and  
feeling it must be possible to solve it.  Simple as it seems, that's
the recipe for a lot of startup ideas.<br><br><b>Wealth</b><br><br>So far most of what I've said applies to ideas in general.  What's  
special about startup ideas?  Startup ideas are ideas for companies,
and companies have to make money.  And the way to make money is to
make something people want.<br><br>Wealth is what people want.  I don't mean that as some kind of  
philosophical statement; I mean it as a tautology.<br><br>So an idea for a startup is an idea for something people want.
Wouldn't any good idea be something people want?  Unfortunately 
not.  I think new theorems are a fine thing to create, but there
is no great demand for them.  Whereas there appears to be great
demand for celebrity gossip magazines.  Wealth is defined democratically.
Good ideas and valuable ideas are not quite the same thing; the
difference is individual tastes.<br><br>But valuable ideas are very close to good ideas, especially in
technology.  I think they're so close that you can get away with
working as if the goal were to discover good ideas, so long as, in
the final stage, you stop and ask: will people actually pay for 
this?  Only a few ideas are likely to make it that far and then get
shot down; RPN calculators might be one example.<br><br>One way to make something people want is to look at stuff people   
use now that's broken.  Dating sites are a prime example.  They   
have millions of users, so they must be promising something people 
want.  And yet they work horribly.  Just ask anyone who uses them.  
It's as if they used the worse-is-better approach but stopped after
the first stage and handed the thing over to marketers.<br><br>Of course, the most obvious breakage in the average computer user's 
life is Windows itself.  But this is a special case: you can't
defeat a monopoly by a frontal attack.  Windows can and will be     
overthrown, but not by giving people a better desktop OS.  The way
to kill it is to redefine the problem as a superset of the current 
one.  The problem is not, what operating system should people use
on desktop computers?  but how should people use applications?
There are answers to that question that don't even involve desktop
computers.<br><br>Everyone thinks Google is going to solve this problem, but it is a
very subtle one, so subtle that a company as big as Google might
well get it wrong.  I think the odds are better than 50-50 that the
Windows killer-- or more accurately, Windows transcender-- will
come from some little startup.<br><br>Another classic way to make something people want is to take a
luxury and make it into a commmodity.  People must want something
if they pay a lot for it.  And it is a very rare product that can't
be made dramatically cheaper if you try.<br><br>This was Henry Ford's plan.  He made cars, which had been a luxury
item, into a commodity.  But the idea is much older than Henry Ford.
Water mills transformed mechanical power from a luxury into a
commodity, and they were used in the Roman empire.  Arguably
pastoralism transformed a luxury into a commodity.<br><br>When you make something cheaper you can sell more of them.  But if
you make something dramatically cheaper you often get qualitative
changes, because people start to use it in different ways.  For
example, once computers get so cheap that most people can have one
of their own, you can use them as communication devices.<br><br>Often to make something dramatically cheaper you have to redefine 
the problem.  The Model T didn't have all the features previous
cars did.  It only came in black, for example.  But it solved the
problem people cared most about, which was getting from place to
place.<br><br>One of the most useful mental habits I know I learned from Michael
Rabin: that the best way to solve a problem is often to redefine
it.  A lot of people use this technique without being consciously
aware of it, but Rabin was spectacularly explicit.  You need a big
prime number?  Those are pretty expensive.  How about if I give you
a big number that only has a 10 to the minus 100 chance of not being
prime?  Would that do?  Well, probably; I mean, that's probably
smaller than the chance that I'm imagining all this anyway.<br><br>Redefining the problem is a particularly juicy heuristic when you
have competitors, because it's so hard for rigid-minded people to 
follow.  You can work in plain sight and they don't realize the 
danger.  Don't worry about us. We're just working on search.  Do   
one thing and do it well, that's our motto.<br><br>Making things cheaper is actually a subset of a more general
technique: making things easier.  For a long time it was most of  
making things easier, but now that the things we build are so
complicated, there's another rapidly growing subset: making things  
easier to <i>use</i>.<br><br>This is an area where there's great room for improvement.  What you
want to be able to say about technology is: it just works.  How
often do you say that now?<br><br>Simplicity takes effort-- genius, even.  The average programmer   
seems to produce UI designs that are almost willfully bad. I was   
trying to use the stove at my mother's house a couple weeks ago. 
It was a new one, and instead of physical knobs it had buttons and
an LED display.  I tried pressing some buttons I thought would cause
it to get hot, and you know what it said?  "Err."  Not even "Error."
"Err."  You can't just say "Err" to the user of a <i>stove</i>.
You should design the UI so that errors are impossible.  And the  
boneheads who designed this stove even had an example of such a UI
to work from: the old one.  You turn one knob to set the temperature
and another to set the timer.  What was wrong with that?  It just
worked.<br><br>It seems that, for the average engineer, more options just means
more rope to hang yourself.  So if you want to start a startup, you
can take almost any existing technology produced by a big company, 
and assume you could build something way easier to use.<br><br><b>Design for Exit</b><br><br>Success for a startup approximately equals getting bought.  You
need some kind of exit strategy, because you can't get the smartest
people to work for you without giving them options likely to be
worth something.  Which means you either have to get bought or go
public, and the number of startups that go public is very small.<br><br>If success probably means getting bought, should you make that a
conscious goal?  The old answer was no: you were supposed to pretend
that you wanted to create a giant, public company, and act surprised
when someone made you an offer.  Really, you want to buy us? Well,
I suppose we'd consider it, for the right price.<br><br>I think things are changing.  If 98% of the time success means   
getting bought, why not be open about it?  If 98% of the time you're
doing product development on spec for some big company, why not
think of that as your task?  One advantage of this approach is that
it gives you another source of ideas: look at big companies, think
what they <a href="http://kiko.com">should</a> 
be doing, and do it yourself.  Even if
they already know it, you'll probably be done faster.<br><br>Just be sure to make something multiple acquirers will want.  Don't
fix Windows, because the only potential acquirer is Microsoft, and  
when there's only one acquirer, they don't have to hurry.  They can
take their time and copy you instead of buying you.  If you want
to get market price, work on something where there's competition.<br><br>If an increasing number of startups are created to do product
development on spec, it will be a natural counterweight to monopolies.
Once some type of technology is captured by a monopoly, it will    
only evolve at big company rates instead of startup rates, whereas
alternatives will evolve with especial speed.  A free market
interprets monopoly as damage and routes around it.<br><br><b>The Woz Route</b><br><br>The most productive way to generate startup ideas is also the
most unlikely-sounding: by accident.  If you look at how famous
startups got started, a lot of them weren't initially supposed to  
be startups.  Lotus began with a program Mitch Kapor wrote for a
friend. Apple got started because Steve Wozniak wanted to build
microcomputers, and his employer, Hewlett-Packard, wouldn't let him
do it at work.  Yahoo began as David Filo's personal collection of
links.<br><br>This is not the only way to start startups.  You can sit down and
consciously come up with an idea for a company; we did.  But measured
in total market cap, the build-stuff-for-yourself model might be  
more fruitful.  It certainly has to be the most fun way to come up
with startup ideas.  And since a startup ought to have multiple
founders who were already friends before they decided to start a 
company, the rather surprising conclusion is that the best way to   
generate startup ideas is to do what hackers do for fun: cook up
amusing hacks with your friends.<br><br>It seems like it violates some kind of conservation law, but there
it is: the best way to get a "million dollar idea" is just to do
what hackers enjoy doing anyway.<br><br><br><br>

squeezed from four directions.  They're already stuck with a seller's
market, because of the huge amounts they raised at the end of the
Bubble and still haven't invested.  This by itself is not the end
of the world.  In fact, it's just a more extreme version of the
<a href="http://www.archub.org/dilbertvc.gif">norm</a>
in the VC business: too much money chasing too few deals.<br><br>Unfortunately, those few deals now want less and less money, because
it's getting so cheap to start a startup.  The four causes: open
source, which makes software free; Moore's law, which makes hardware
geometrically closer to free; the Web, which makes promotion free
if you're good; and better languages, which make development a lot
cheaper.<br><br>When we started our startup in 1995, the first three were our biggest
expenses.  We had to pay $5000 for the Netscape Commerce Server,
the only software that then supported secure http connections.  We
paid $3000 for a server with a 90 MHz processor and 32 meg of
memory.  And we paid a PR firm about $30,000 to promote our launch.<br><br>Now you could get all three for nothing.  You can get the software
for free; people throw away computers more powerful than our first
server; and if you make something good you can generate ten times
as much traffic by word of mouth online than our first PR firm got
through the print media.<br><br>And of course another big change for the average startup is that
programming languages have improved-- or rather, the <a href="avg.html">median language</a> has.  At most startups ten years
ago, software development meant ten programmers writing code in
C++.  Now the same work might be done by one or two using Python
or Ruby.<br><br>During the Bubble, a lot of people predicted that startups would
outsource their development to India.  I think a better model for
the future is David Heinemeier Hansson, who outsourced his development
to a more powerful language instead.  A lot of well-known applications
are now, like BaseCamp, written by just one programmer.  And one
guy is more than 10x cheaper than ten, because (a) he won't waste
any time in meetings, and (b) since he's probably a founder, he can
pay himself nothing.<br><br>Because starting a startup is so cheap, venture capitalists now
often want to give startups more money than the startups want to
take.  VCs like to invest several million at a time.  But as one
VC told me after a startup he funded would only take about half a
million, "I don't know what we're going to do.  Maybe we'll just
have to give some of it back." Meaning give some of the fund back
to the institutional investors who supplied it, because it wasn't
going to be possible to invest it all.<br><br>Into this already bad situation comes the third problem: Sarbanes-Oxley.
Sarbanes-Oxley is a law, passed after the Bubble, that drastically
increases the regulatory burden on public companies. And in addition
to the cost of compliance, which is at least two million dollars a
year, the law introduces frightening legal exposure for corporate
officers.  An experienced CFO I know said flatly: "I would not
want to be CFO of a public company now."<br><br>You might think that responsible corporate governance is an area
where you can't go too far.  But you can go too far in any law, and
this remark convinced me that Sarbanes-Oxley must have.  This CFO
is both the smartest and the most upstanding money guy I know.  If
Sarbanes-Oxley deters people like him from being CFOs of public  
companies, that's proof enough that it's broken.<br><br>Largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley, few startups go public now.  For
all practical purposes, succeeding now equals getting bought.  Which
means VCs are now in the business of finding promising little 2-3
man startups and pumping them up into companies that cost $100
million to acquire.   They didn't mean to be in this business; it's
just what their business has evolved into.<br><br>Hence the fourth problem: the acquirers have begun to realize they
can buy wholesale.  Why should they wait for VCs to make the startups
they want more expensive?  Most of what the VCs add, acquirers don't
want anyway.  The acquirers already have brand recognition and HR
departments.  What they really want is the software and the developers,
and that's what the startup is in the early phase: concentrated
software and developers.<br><br>Google, typically, seems to have been the first to figure this out.
"Bring us your startups early," said Google's speaker at the <a href="http://startupschool.org">Startup School</a>.  They're quite
explicit about it: they like to acquire startups at just the point
where they would do a Series A round.  (The Series A round is the
first round of real VC funding; it usually happens in the first
year.) It is a brilliant strategy, and one that other big technology
companies will no doubt try to duplicate.  Unless they want to have 
still more of their lunch eaten by Google.<br><br>Of course, Google has an advantage in buying startups: a lot of the
people there are rich, or expect to be when their options vest.
Ordinary employees find it very hard to recommend an acquisition;
it's just too annoying to see a bunch of twenty year olds get rich
when you're still working for salary.  Even if it's the right thing   
for your company to do.<br><br><b>The Solution(s)</b><br><br>Bad as things look now, there is a way for VCs to save themselves.
They need to do two things, one of which won't surprise them, and  
another that will seem an anathema.<br><br>Let's start with the obvious one: lobby to get Sarbanes-Oxley  
loosened.  This law was created to prevent future Enrons, not to
destroy the IPO market.  Since the IPO market was practically dead
when it passed, few saw what bad effects it would have.  But now 
that technology has recovered from the last bust, we can see clearly
what a bottleneck Sarbanes-Oxley has become.<br><br>Startups are fragile plants—seedlings, in fact.  These seedlings
are worth protecting, because they grow into the trees of the
economy.  Much of the economy's growth is their growth.  I think
most politicians realize that.  But they don't realize just how   
fragile startups are, and how easily they can become collateral
damage of laws meant to fix some other problem.<br><br>Still more dangerously, when you destroy startups, they make very
little noise.  If you step on the toes of the coal industry, you'll
hear about it.  But if you inadvertantly squash the startup industry,
all that happens is that the founders of the next Google stay in 
grad school instead of starting a company.<br><br>My second suggestion will seem shocking to VCs: let founders cash  
out partially in the Series A round.  At the moment, when VCs invest
in a startup, all the stock they get is newly issued and all the 
money goes to the company.  They could buy some stock directly from
the founders as well.<br><br>Most VCs have an almost religious rule against doing this.  They
don't want founders to get a penny till the company is sold or goes
public.  VCs are obsessed with control, and they worry that they'll
have less leverage over the founders if the founders have any money.<br><br>This is a dumb plan.  In fact, letting the founders sell a little stock
early would generally be better for the company, because it would
cause the founders' attitudes toward risk to be aligned with the
VCs'.  As things currently work, their attitudes toward risk tend
to be diametrically opposed: the founders, who have nothing, would
prefer a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million,
while the VCs can afford to be "rational" and prefer the latter.<br><br>Whatever they say, the reason founders are selling their companies
early instead of doing Series A rounds is that they get paid up
front.  That first million is just worth so much more than the
subsequent ones.  If founders could sell a little stock early,
they'd be happy to take VC money and bet the rest on a bigger
outcome.<br><br>So why not let the founders have that first million, or at least
half million?  The VCs would get same number of shares for the   
money.  So what if some of the money would go to the  
founders instead of the company?<br><br>Some VCs will say this is
unthinkable—that they want all their money to be put to work
growing the company.  But the fact is, the huge size of current VC
investments is dictated by the <a href="venturecapital.html">structure</a>
of VC funds, not the needs of startups.  Often as not these large  
investments go to work destroying the company rather than growing
it.<br><br>The angel investors who funded our startup let the founders sell
some stock directly to them, and it was a good deal for everyone. 
The angels made a huge return on that investment, so they're happy.
And for us founders it blunted the terrifying all-or-nothingness
of a startup, which in its raw form is more a distraction than a
motivator.<br><br>If VCs are frightened at the idea of letting founders partially
cash out, let me tell them something still more frightening: you
are now competing directly with Google.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>
November 2005<br><br><!-- <i>(This 
article is meant to be a complete summary of funding options
for startup founders.  In effect we're open-sourcing the kernel of
what we tell founders about funding at <nota href="http://ycombinator.com">Y
Combinator</a>.)</i>
-->
Venture funding works like gears.  A typical startup goes through
several rounds of funding, and at each round you want to take just
enough money to reach the speed where you can shift into the next
gear.<br><br>Few startups get it quite right.  Many are underfunded.  A few are
overfunded, which is like trying to start driving in third gear.<br><br>I think it would help founders to understand funding better—not
just the mechanics of it, but what investors are thinking.  I was
surprised recently when I realized that all the worst problems we
faced in our startup were due not to competitors, but investors.
Dealing with competitors was easy by comparison.<br><br>I don't mean to suggest that our investors were nothing but a drag
on us.  They were helpful in negotiating deals, for example.  I
mean more that conflicts with investors are particularly nasty.
Competitors punch you in the jaw, but investors have you by the
balls.<br><br>Apparently our situation was not unusual.  And if trouble with
investors is one of the biggest threats to a startup, managing them
is one of the most important skills founders need to learn.<br><br>Let's start by talking about the five sources of startup funding.
Then we'll trace the life of a hypothetical (very fortunate) startup
as it shifts gears through successive rounds.<br><br><b>Friends and Family</b><br><br>A lot of startups get their first funding from friends and family.
Excite did, for example: after the founders graduated from college,
they borrowed $15,000 from their parents to start a company.  With
the help of some part-time jobs they made it last 18 months.<br><br>If your friends or family happen to be rich, the line blurs between
them and angel investors.  At Viaweb we got our first $10,000 of
seed money from our friend Julian, but he was sufficiently rich
that it's hard to say whether he should be classified as a friend
or angel.  He was also a lawyer, which was great, because it meant
we didn't have to pay legal bills out of that initial small sum.<br><br>The advantage of raising money from friends and family is that
they're easy to find.  You already know them.  There are three main
disadvantages: you mix together your business and personal life;
they will probably not be as well connected as angels or venture
firms; and they may not be accredited investors, which could
complicate your life later.<br><br>The SEC defines an "accredited investor" as someone with over a
million dollars in liquid assets or an income of over $200,000 a
year.  The regulatory burden is much lower if a company's shareholders
are all accredited investors.  Once you take money from the general
public you're more restricted in what you can do. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>A startup's life will be more complicated, legally, if any of the
investors aren't accredited.  In an IPO, it might not merely add
expense, but change the outcome. A lawyer I asked about it said:
</p><blockquote>
  When the company goes public, the SEC will carefully study all
  prior issuances of stock by the company and demand that it take
  immediate action to cure any past violations of securities laws.
  Those remedial actions can delay, stall or even kill the IPO.
</blockquote>
Of course the odds of any given startup doing an IPO are small.
But not as small as they might seem. A lot of startups that end up
going public didn't seem likely to at first. (Who could have guessed
that the company Wozniak and Jobs started in their spare time selling
plans for microcomputers would yield one of the biggest IPOs of the
decade?) Much of the value of a startup consists of that tiny
probability multiplied by the huge outcome.<br><br>It wasn't because they weren't accredited investors that I didn't
ask my parents for seed money, though.  When we were starting Viaweb,
I didn't know about the concept of an accredited investor, and
didn't stop to think about the value of investors' connections.
The reason I didn't take money from my parents was that I didn't
want them to lose it.<br><br><b>Consulting</b><br><br>Another way to fund a startup is to get a job.  The best sort of
job is a consulting project in which you can build whatever software
you wanted to sell as a startup.  Then you can gradually transform
yourself from a consulting company into a product company, and have
your clients pay your development expenses.<br><br>This is a good plan for someone with kids, because it takes most
of the risk out of starting a startup.  There never has to be a
time when you have no revenues.  Risk and reward are usually
proportionate, however: you should expect a plan that cuts the risk
of starting a startup also to cut the average return.  In this case,
you trade decreased financial risk for increased risk that your
company won't succeed as a startup.<br><br>But isn't the consulting company itself a startup?  No, not generally.
A company has to be more than small and newly founded to be a
startup.  There are millions of small businesses in America, but
only a few thousand are startups.  To be a startup, a company has
to be a product business, not a service business.  By which I mean
not that it has to make something physical, but that it has to have
one thing it sells to many people, rather than doing custom work
for individual clients.  Custom work doesn't scale.  To be a startup
you need to be the band that sells a million copies of a song, not
the band that makes money by playing at individual weddings and bar
mitzvahs.<br><br>The trouble with consulting is that clients have an awkward habit
of calling you on the phone.  Most startups operate close to the
margin of failure, and the distraction of having to deal with clients
could be enough to put you over the edge.  Especially if you have
competitors who get to work full time on just being a startup.<br><br>So you have to be very disciplined if you take the consulting route.
You have to work actively to prevent your company growing into a
"weed tree," dependent on this source of easy but low-margin money.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Indeed, the biggest danger of consulting may be that it gives you
an excuse for failure.  In a startup, as in grad school, a lot of
what ends up driving you are the expectations of your family and
friends.  Once you start a startup and tell everyone that's what
you're doing, you're now on a path labelled "get rich or bust." You
now have to get rich, or you've failed.<br><br>Fear of failure is an extraordinarily powerful force.  Usually it
prevents people from starting things, but once you publish some
definite ambition, it switches directions and starts working in
your favor.  I think it's a pretty clever piece of jiujitsu to set
this irresistible force against the slightly less immovable object
of becoming rich.  You won't have it driving you if your stated
ambition is merely to start a consulting company that you will one
day morph into a startup.<br><br>An advantage of consulting, as a way to develop a product, is that
you know you're making something at least one customer wants.  But
if you have what it takes to start a startup you should have
sufficient vision not to need this crutch.<br><br><b>Angel Investors</b><br><br><i>Angels</i> are individual rich people.  The word was first used
for backers of Broadway plays, but now applies to individual investors
generally.  Angels who've made money in technology are preferable,
for two reasons: they understand your situation, and they're a
source of contacts and advice.<br><br>The contacts and advice can be more important than the money.  When
del.icio.us took money from investors, they took money from, among
others, Tim O'Reilly.  The amount he put in was small compared to
the VCs who led the round, but Tim is a smart and influential guy
and it's good to have him on your side.<br><br>You can do whatever you want with money from consulting or friends
and family.  With angels we're now talking about venture funding
proper, so it's time to introduce the concept of <i>exit strategy</i>.
Younger would-be founders are often surprised that investors expect
them either to sell the company or go public.  The reason is that
investors need to get their capital back.  They'll only consider
companies that have an exit strategy—meaning companies that could
get bought or go public.<br><br>This is not as selfish as it sounds.  There are few large, private
technology companies.  Those that don't fail all seem to get bought
or go public.  The reason is that employees are investors too—of
their time—and they want just as much to be able to cash out.  If
your competitors offer employees stock options that might make them
rich, while you make it clear you plan to stay private, your
competitors will get the best people. So the principle of an "exit"
is not just something forced on startups by investors, but part of
what it means to be a startup.<br><br>Another concept we need to introduce now is valuation.  When someone
buys shares in a company, that implicitly establishes a value for
it.  If someone pays $20,000 for 10% of a company, the company is
in theory worth $200,000.  I say "in theory" because in early stage
investing, valuations are voodoo.  As a company gets more established,
its valuation gets closer to an actual market value.  But in a newly
founded startup, the valuation number is just an artifact of the
respective contributions of everyone involved.<br><br>Startups often "pay" investors who will help the company in some
way by letting them invest at low valuations.  If I had a startup
and Steve Jobs wanted to invest in it, I'd give him the stock for
$10, just to be able to brag that he was an investor.  Unfortunately,
it's impractical (if not illegal) to adjust the valuation of the
company up and down for each investor.  Startups' valuations are
supposed to rise over time.  So if you're going to sell cheap stock
to eminent angels, do it early, when it's natural for the company
to have a low valuation.<br><br>Some angel investors join together in syndicates.  Any city where
people start startups will have one or more of them.  In Boston the
biggest is the <a href="http://commonangels.com/home.html">Common
Angels</a>.  In the Bay Area it's the <a href="http://bandangels.com/">Band
of Angels</a>.  You can find groups near you through the <a href="http://angelcapitalassociation.org/">Angel Capital Association</a>.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
However, most angel investors don't belong to these groups.  In
fact, the more prominent the angel, the less likely they are to
belong to a group.<br><br>Some angel groups charge you money to pitch your idea to them.
Needless to say, you should never do this.<br><br>One of the dangers of taking investment from individual angels,
rather than through an angel group or investment firm, is that they
have less reputation to protect.  A big-name VC firm will not screw
you too outrageously, because other founders would avoid them if
word got out.  With individual angels you don't have this protection,
as we found to our dismay in our own startup.  In many startups'
lives there comes a point when you're at the investors' 
mercy—when you're out of money and the only place to get more is your
existing investors.  When we got into such a scrape, our investors
took advantage of it in a way that a name-brand VC probably wouldn't
have.<br><br>Angels have a corresponding advantage, however: they're also not
bound by all the rules that VC firms are.  And so they can, for
example, allow founders to cash out partially in a funding round,
by selling some of their stock directly to the investors.  I think
this will become more common; the average founder is eager to do
it, and selling, say, half a million dollars worth of stock will
not, as VCs fear, cause most founders to be any less committed to
the business.<br><br>The same angels who tried to screw us also let us do this, and so
on balance I'm grateful rather than angry.  (As in families, relations
between founders and investors can be complicated.)<br><br>The best way to find angel investors is through personal introductions.
You could try to cold-call angel groups near you, but angels, like
VCs, will pay more attention to deals recommended by someone they
respect.<br><br>Deal terms with angels vary a lot.  There are no generally accepted
standards.  Sometimes angels' deal terms are as fearsome as VCs'.
Other angels, particularly in the earliest stages, will invest based
on a two-page agreement.<br><br>Angels who only invest occasionally may not themselves know what
terms they want.  They just want to invest in this startup.  What
kind of anti-dilution protection do they want?  Hell if they know.
In these situations, the deal terms tend to be random: the angel
asks his lawyer to create a vanilla agreement, and the terms end
up being whatever the lawyer considers vanilla.  Which in practice
usually means, whatever existing agreement he finds lying around
his firm.  (Few legal documents are created from scratch.)<br><br>These heaps o' boilerplate are a problem for small startups, because
they tend to grow into the union of all preceding documents.  I
know of one startup that got from an angel investor what amounted
to a five hundred pound handshake: after deciding to invest, the
angel presented them with a 70-page agreement.  The startup didn't
have enough money to pay a lawyer even to read it, let alone negotiate
the terms, so the deal fell through.<br><br>One solution to this problem would be to have the startup's lawyer
produce the agreement, instead of the angel's.  Some angels might
balk at this, but others would probably welcome it.<br><br>Inexperienced angels often get cold feet when the time comes to
write that big check.  In our startup, one of the two angels in the
initial round took months to pay us, and only did after repeated
nagging from our lawyer, who was also, fortunately, his lawyer.<br><br>It's obvious why investors delay.  Investing in startups is risky!
When a company is only two months old, every <i>day</i> you wait
gives you 1.7% more data about their trajectory.  But the investor
is already being compensated for that risk in the low price of the
stock, so it is unfair to delay.<br><br>Fair or not, investors do it if you let them.  Even VCs do it.  And
funding delays are a big distraction for founders, who ought to be
working on their company, not worrying about investors.  What's a
startup to do?  With both investors and acquirers, the only leverage
you have is competition.  If an investor knows you have other
investors lined up, he'll be a lot more eager to close-- and not
just because he'll worry about losing the deal, but because if other
investors are interested, you must be worth investing in.  It's the
same with acquisitions.  No one wants to buy you till someone else
wants to buy you, and then everyone wants to buy you.<br><br>The key to closing deals is never to stop pursuing alternatives.
When an investor says he wants to invest in you, or an acquirer
says they want to buy you, <i>don't believe it till you get the
check.</i>  Your natural tendency when an investor says yes will
be to relax and go back to writing code.  Alas, you can't; you have
to keep looking for more investors, if only to get this one to act.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Seed Funding Firms</b><br><br>Seed firms are like angels in that they invest relatively small
amounts at early stages, but like VCs in that they're companies
that do it as a business, rather than individuals making occasional
investments on the side.<br><br>Till now, nearly all seed firms have been so-called "incubators,"
so <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> gets called
one too, though the only thing we have in common is that we invest
in the earliest phase.<br><br>According to the National Association of Business Incubators, there
are about 800 incubators in the US.  This is an astounding number,
because I know the founders of a lot of startups, and I can't think
of one that began in an incubator.<br><br>What is an incubator?  I'm not sure myself.  The defining quality
seems to be that you work in their space.  That's where the name
"incubator" comes from.  They seem to vary a great deal in other
respects.  At one extreme is the sort of pork-barrel project where
a town gets money from the state government to renovate a vacant
building as a "high-tech incubator," as if it were merely lack of
the right sort of office space that had till now prevented the town
from becoming a 
<a href="siliconvalley.html">startup hub</a>.  
At the other extreme are places like
Idealab, which generates ideas for new startups internally and hires
people to work for them.<br><br>The classic Bubble incubators, most of which now seem to be dead,
were like VC firms except that they took a much bigger role in the
startups they funded.  In addition to working in their space, you
were supposed to use their office staff, lawyers, accountants, and
so on.<br><br>Whereas incubators tend (or tended) to exert more control than VCs,
Y Combinator exerts less.  <!-- We just supply seed money, advice, and
introductions.  We don't want any control over the startups we fund. -->
And we think it's better if startups operate out of their own
premises, however crappy, than the offices of their investors.  So
it's annoying that we keep getting called an "incubator," but perhaps
inevitable, because there's only one of us so far and no word yet
for what we are.  If we have to be called something, the obvious
name would be "excubator." (The name is more excusable if one
considers it as meaning that we enable people to escape cubicles.)<br><br>Because seed firms are companies rather than individual people,
reaching them is easier than reaching angels.  Just go to their web
site and send them an email.  The importance of personal introductions
varies, but is less than with angels or VCs.<br><br>The fact that seed firms are companies also means the investment
process is more standardized.  (This is generally true with angel
groups too.) Seed firms will probably have set deal terms they use
for every startup they fund.  The fact that the deal terms are
standard doesn't mean they're favorable to you, but if other startups
have signed the same agreements and things went well for them, it's
a sign the terms are reasonable.<br><br>Seed firms differ from angels and VCs in that they invest exclusively
in the earliest phases—often when the company is still just an
idea.  Angels and even VC firms occasionally do this, but they also
invest at later stages.<br><br>The problems are different in the early stages.  For example, in
the first couple months a startup may completely redefine their <a href="ideas.html">idea</a>.  So seed investors usually care less
about the idea than the people. This is true of all venture funding,
but especially so in the seed stage.<br><br>Like VCs, one of the advantages of seed firms is the advice they
offer.  But because seed firms operate in an earlier phase, they
need to offer different kinds of advice.  For example, a seed firm
should be able to give advice about how to approach VCs, which VCs
obviously don't need to do; whereas VCs should be able to give
advice about how to hire an "executive team," which is not an issue
in the seed stage.<br><br>In the earliest phases, a lot of the problems are technical, so
seed firms should be able to help with technical as well as business
problems.<br><br>Seed firms and angel investors generally want to invest in the
initial phases of a startup, then hand them off to VC firms for the
next round.  Occasionally startups go from seed funding direct to
acquisition, however, and I expect this to become increasingly
common.<br><br>Google has been aggressively pursuing this route, and now <a href="http://ycombinator.com/buckman.html">Yahoo</a> is too.  Both
now compete directly with VCs.  And this is a smart move.  Why wait
for further funding rounds to jack up a startup's price?  When a
startup reaches the point where VCs have enough information to
invest in it, the acquirer should have enough information to buy
it.  More information, in fact; with their technical depth, the
acquirers should be better at picking winners than VCs.<br><br><b>Venture Capital Funds</b><br><br>VC firms are like seed firms in that they're actual companies, but
they invest other people's money, and much larger amounts of it.
VC investments average several million dollars.  So they tend to
come later in the life of a startup, are harder to get, and come
with tougher terms.<br><br>The word "venture capitalist" is sometimes used loosely for any
venture investor, but there is a sharp difference between VCs and
other investors: VC firms are organized as <i>funds</i>, much like
hedge funds or mutual funds.  The fund managers, who are called
"general partners," get about 2% of the fund annually as a management
fee, plus about 20% of the fund's gains.<br><br>There is a very sharp dropoff in performance among VC firms, because
in the VC business both success and failure are self-perpetuating.
When an investment scores spectacularly, as Google did for Kleiner
and Sequoia, it generates a lot of good publicity for the VCs.  And
many founders prefer to take money from successful VC firms, because
of the legitimacy it confers.  Hence a vicious (for the losers)
cycle:  VC firms that have been doing badly will only get the deals
the bigger fish have rejected, causing them to continue to do badly.<br><br>As a result, of the thousand or so VC funds in the US now, only
about 50 are likely to make money, and it is very hard for a new
fund to break into this group.<br><br>In a sense, the lower-tier VC firms are a bargain for founders.
They may not be quite as smart or as well connected as the big-name
firms, but they are much hungrier for deals.  This means you should
be able to get better terms from them.<br><br>Better how?  The most obvious is valuation: they'll take less of
your company.  But as well as money, there's power.  I think founders
will increasingly be able to stay on as CEO, and on terms that will
make it fairly hard to fire them later.<br><br>The most dramatic change, I predict,
is that VCs will allow founders to 
cash out partially by <a href="vcsqueeze.html">selling</a>
some of their stock direct to the VC firm.  VCs have traditionally
resisted letting founders get anything before the ultimate "liquidity
event."  But they're also desperate for deals.  And since I know
from my own experience that the rule against buying stock from
founders is a stupid one, this is a natural place for things to
give as venture funding becomes more and more a seller's market.<br><br>The disadvantage of taking money from less known firms is that
people will assume, correctly or not, that you were turned down by
the more exalted ones.  But, like where you went to college, the
name of your VC stops mattering once you have some performance to
measure.  So the more confident you are, the less you need a
brand-name VC.  We funded Viaweb entirely with angel money; it never
occurred to us that the backing of a well known VC firm would make
us seem more impressive.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another danger of less known firms is that, like angels, they have
less reputation to protect.   I suspect it's the lower-tier firms
that are responsible for most of the tricks that have given VCs
such a bad reputation among hackers.  They are doubly hosed: the
general partners themselves are less able, and yet they have harder
problems to solve, because the top VCs skim off all the best deals,
leaving the lower-tier firms exactly the startups that are likely
to blow up.<br><br>For example, lower-tier firms are much more likely to pretend to
want to do a deal with you just to lock you up while they decide
if they really want to.  One experienced CFO said:
<blockquote>
 The better ones usually will not give a term sheet unless they
 really want to do a deal. The second or third tier firms have a
 much higher break rate—it could be as high as 50%.
</blockquote>
It's obvious why: the lower-tier firms' biggest fear, when chance
throws them a bone, is that one of the big dogs will notice and
take it away.  The big dogs don't have to worry about that.<br><br>Falling victim to this trick could really hurt you.  As one
VC told me:
<blockquote>
  If you were talking to four VCs, told three of them that you
  accepted a term sheet, and then have to call them back to tell
  them you were just kidding, you are absolutely damaged goods.
</blockquote>
Here's a partial solution: when a VC offers you a term sheet, ask
how many of their last 10 term sheets turned into deals.  This will
at least force them to lie outright if they want to mislead you.<br><br>Not all the people who work at VC firms are partners.  Most firms
also have a handful of junior employees called something like
associates or analysts.  If you get a call from a VC
firm, go to their web site and check whether the person you talked
to is a partner.  Odds are it will be a junior person; they scour
the web looking for startups their bosses could invest in.  The
junior people will tend to seem very positive about your company.
They're not pretending; they <i>want</i> to believe you're a hot
prospect, because it would be a huge coup for them if their firm
invested in a company they discovered.  Don't be misled by this
optimism.  It's the partners who decide, and they view things with
a colder eye.<br><br>Because VCs invest large amounts, the money comes with more
restrictions.  Most only come into effect if the company gets into
trouble.  For example, VCs generally write it into the deal that
in any sale, they get their investment back first.  So if the company
gets sold at a low price, the founders could get nothing.  Some VCs
now require that in any sale they get 4x their investment back
before the common stock holders (that is, you) get anything, but
this is an abuse that should be resisted.<br><br>Another difference with large investments is that the founders are
usually required to accept "vesting"—to surrender their stock and
earn it back over the next 4-5 years.  VCs don't want to invest
millions in a company the founders could just walk away from.
Financially, vesting has little effect, but in some situations it
could mean founders will have less power.  If VCs got de facto
control of the company and fired one of the founders, he'd lose any
unvested stock unless there was specific protection against this.
So vesting would in that situation force founders to toe the line.<br><br>The most noticeable change when a startup takes serious funding is
that the founders will no longer have complete control.  Ten years
ago VCs used to insist that founders step down as CEO and hand the
job over to a business guy they supplied.  This is less the rule
now, partly because the disasters of the Bubble showed that generic
business guys don't make such great CEOs.<br><br>But while founders will increasingly be able to stay on as CEO,
they'll have to cede some power, because the board of directors
will become more powerful.  In the seed stage, the board is generally
a formality; if you want to talk to the other board members, you
just yell into the next room.  This stops with VC-scale money.  In
a typical VC funding deal, the board of directors might be composed
of two VCs, two founders, and one outside person acceptable to both.
The board will have ultimate power, which means the founders now
have to convince instead of commanding.<br><br>This is not as bad as it sounds, however.  Bill Gates is in the
same position; he doesn't have majority control of Microsoft; in
principle he also has to convince instead of commanding.  And yet
he seems pretty commanding, doesn't he?  As long as things are going
smoothly, boards don't interfere much.  The danger comes when there's
a bump in the road, as happened to Steve Jobs at Apple.<br><br>Like angels, VCs prefer to invest in deals that come to them through
people they know.  So while nearly all VC funds have some address
you can send your business plan to, VCs privately admit the chance
of getting funding by this route is near zero.  One recently told
me that he did not know a single startup that got funded this way.<br><br>I suspect VCs accept business plans "over the transom" more as a
way to keep tabs on industry trends than as a source of deals.  In
fact, I would strongly advise against mailing your business plan
randomly to VCs, because they treat this as evidence of laziness.
Do the extra work of getting personal introductions.  As one VC put
it:
<blockquote>
  I'm not hard to find.  I know a lot of people.  If you can't find
  some way to reach me, how are you going to create a successful
  company?
</blockquote>
One of the most difficult problems for startup founders is deciding
when to approach VCs. You really only get one chance, because they
rely heavily on first impressions.  And you can't approach some and
save others for later, because (a) they ask who else you've talked
to and when and (b) they talk among themselves.  If you're talking
to one VC and he finds out that you were rejected by another several
months ago, you'll definitely seem shopworn.<br><br>So when do you approach VCs?  When you can convince them.  If the
founders have impressive resumes and the idea isn't hard to understand,
you could approach VCs quite early.  Whereas if the founders are
unknown and the idea is very novel, you might have to launch the
thing and show that users loved it before VCs would be convinced.<br><br>If several VCs are interested in you, they will sometimes be willing
to split the deal between them.  They're more likely to do this if
they're close in the VC pecking order.  Such deals may be a net win
for founders, because you get multiple VCs interested in your
success, and you can ask each for advice about the other.  One
founder I know wrote:
<blockquote>
  Two-firm deals are great. It costs you a little more equity, but
  being able to play the two firms off each other (as well as ask
  one if the other is being out of line) is invaluable.
</blockquote>
When you do negotiate with VCs, remember that they've done this a
lot more than you have.  They've invested in dozens of startups,
whereas this is probably the first you've founded.  But don't let
them or the situation intimidate you. The average founder is smarter
than the average VC.  So just do what you'd do in any complex,
unfamiliar situation: proceed deliberately, and question anything
that seems odd.<br><br>It is, unfortunately, common for VCs to put terms in an agreement
whose consequences surprise founders later, and also common for VCs
to defend things they do by saying that they're standard in the
industry.  Standard, schmandard; the whole industry is only a few
decades old, and rapidly evolving.  The concept of "standard" is a
useful one when you're operating on a small scale (Y Combinator
uses identical terms for every deal because for tiny seed-stage
investments it's not worth the overhead of negotiating individual
deals), but it doesn't apply at the VC level.  On that scale, every
negotiation is unique.<br><br>Most successful startups get money from more than one of the preceding
five sources. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font>
And, confusingly, the names of funding sources
also tend to be used as the names of different rounds.  The best
way to explain how it all works is to follow the case of a hypothetical
startup.<br><br><b>Stage 1: Seed Round</b><br><br>Our startup begins when a group of three friends have an idea--
either an idea for something they might build, or simply the idea
"let's start a company."  Presumably they already have some source
of food and shelter.  But if you have food and shelter, you probably
also have something you're supposed to be working on: either
classwork, or a job.  So if you want to work full-time on a startup,
your money situation will probably change too.<br><br>A lot of startup founders say they started the company without any
idea of what they planned to do.  This is actually less common than
it seems: many have to claim they thought of the idea after quitting
because otherwise their former employer would own it.<br><br>The three friends decide to take the leap.  Since most startups are
in competitive businesses, you not only want to work full-time on
them, but more than full-time.  So some or all of the friends quit
their jobs or leave school.  (Some of the founders in a startup can
stay in grad school, but at least one has to make the company his
full-time job.)<br><br>They're going to run the company out of one of their apartments at
first, and since they don't have any users they don't have to pay
much for infrastructure.  Their main expenses are setting up the
company, which costs a couple thousand dollars in legal work and
registration fees, and the living expenses of the founders.<br><br>The phrase "seed investment" covers a broad range.  To some VC firms
it means $500,000, but to most startups it means several months'
living expenses.  We'll suppose our group of friends start with
$15,000 from their friend's rich uncle, who they give 5% of the
company in return.  There's only common stock at this stage.  They
leave 20% as an options pool for later employees (but they set
things up so that they can issue this stock to themselves if they
get bought early and most is still unissued), and the three founders
each get 25%.<br><br>By living really cheaply they think they can make the remaining
money last five months.  When you have five months' runway left,
how soon do you need to start looking for your next round?  Answer:
immediately.  It takes time to find investors, and time (always
more than you expect) for the deal to close even after they say
yes.  So if our group of founders know what they're doing they'll
start sniffing around for angel investors right away.  But of course
their main job is to build version 1 of their software.<br><br>The friends might have liked to have more money in this first phase,
but being slightly underfunded teaches them an important lesson.
For a startup, cheapness is power.  The lower your costs, the more
options you have—not just at this stage, but at every point till
you're profitable.  When you have a high "burn rate," you're always
under time pressure, which means (a) you don't have time for your
ideas to evolve, and (b) you're often forced to take deals you don't
like.<br><br>Every startup's rule should be: spend little, and work fast.<br><br>After ten weeks' work the three friends have built a prototype that
gives one a taste of what their product will do.  It's not what
they originally set out to do—in the process of writing it, they
had some new ideas.  And it only does a fraction of what the finished
product will do, but that fraction includes stuff that no one else
has done before.<br><br>They've also written at least a skeleton business plan, addressing
the five fundamental questions: what they're going to do, why users
need it, how large the market is, how they'll make money, and who
the competitors are and why this company is going to beat them.
(That last has to be more specific than "they suck" or "we'll work
really hard.")<br><br>If you have to choose between spending time on the demo or the
business plan, spend most on the demo.   Software is not only more
convincing, but a better way to explore ideas.<br><br><b>Stage 2: Angel Round</b><br><br>While writing the prototype, the group has been traversing their
network of friends in search of angel investors.  They find some
just as the prototype is demoable.  When they demo it, one of the
angels is willing to invest.  Now the group is looking for more
money: they want enough to last for a year, and maybe to hire a
couple friends.  So they're going to raise $200,000.<br><br>The angel agrees to invest at a pre-money valuation of $1 million.
The company issues $200,000 worth of new shares to the angel; if
there were 1000 shares before the deal, this means 200 additional
shares.  The angel now owns 200/1200 shares, or a sixth of the
company, and all the previous shareholders' percentage ownership
is diluted by a sixth.  After the deal, the capitalization table
looks like this:
<xmp>
shareholder   shares    percent
-------------------------------
angel           200       16.7
uncle            50        4.2
each founder    250       20.8
option pool     200       16.7
               ----      -----
total          1200      100
</xmp>
To keep things simple, I had the angel do a straight cash for stock
deal.  In reality the angel might be more likely to make the
investment in the form of a convertible loan.  A convertible loan
is a loan that can be converted into stock later; it works out the
same as a stock purchase in the end, but gives the angel more
protection against being squashed by VCs in future rounds.<br><br>Who pays the legal bills for this deal?  The startup, remember,
only has a couple thousand left.  In practice this turns out to be
a sticky problem that usually gets solved in some improvised way.
Maybe the startup can find lawyers who will do it cheaply in the
hope of future work if the startup succeeds.  Maybe someone has a
lawyer friend.  Maybe the angel pays for his lawyer to represent
both sides.  (Make sure if you take the latter route that the lawyer
is <i>representing</i> you rather than merely advising you, or his
only duty is to the investor.)<br><br>An angel investing $200k would probably expect a seat on the board
of directors.  He might also want preferred stock, meaning a special
class of stock that has some additional rights over the common stock
everyone else has.  Typically these rights include vetoes over major
strategic decisions, protection against being diluted in future
rounds, and the right to get one's investment back first if the
company is sold.<br><br>Some investors might expect the founders to accept vesting for a
sum this size, and others wouldn't.  VCs are more likely to require
vesting than angels.  At Viaweb we managed to raise $2.5 million
from angels without ever accepting vesting, largely because we were
so inexperienced that we were appalled at the idea.  In practice
this turned out to be good, because it made us harder to push around.<br><br>Our experience was unusual; vesting is the norm for amounts that
size.  Y Combinator doesn't require vesting, because (a) we invest
such small amounts, and (b) we think it's unnecessary, and that the
hope of getting rich is enough motivation to keep founders at work.
But maybe if we were investing millions we would think differently.<br><br>I should add that vesting is also a way for founders to protect
themselves against one another.  It solves the problem of what to
do if one of the founders quits.  So some founders impose it on
themselves when they start the company.<br><br>The angel deal takes two weeks to close, so we are now three months
into the life of the company.<br><br>The point after you get the first big chunk of angel money will
usually be the happiest phase in a startup's life.  It's a lot like
being a postdoc: you have no immediate financial worries, and few
responsibilities.  You get to work on juicy kinds of work, like
designing software.  You don't have to spend time on bureaucratic
stuff, because you haven't hired any bureaucrats yet.  Enjoy it
while it lasts, and get as much done as you can, because you will
never again be so productive.<br><br>With an apparently inexhaustible sum of money sitting safely in the
bank, the founders happily set to work turning their prototype into
something they can release.  They hire one of their friends—at
first just as a consultant, so they can try him out—and then a
month later as employee #1. They pay him the smallest salary he can
live on, plus 3% of the company in restricted stock, vesting over
four years.  (So after this the option pool is down to 13.7%).  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font>
They also spend a little money on a freelance graphic designer.<br><br>How much stock do you give early employees?  That varies so much
that there's no conventional number.  If you get someone really
good, really early, it might be wise to give him as much stock as
the founders.  The one universal rule is that the amount of stock
an employee gets decreases polynomially with the age of the company.
In other words, you get rich as a power of how early you were.  So
if some friends want you to come work for their startup, don't wait
several months before deciding.<br><br>A month later, at the end of month four, our group of founders have
something they can launch.  Gradually through word of mouth they
start to get users.  Seeing the system in use by real users—people
they don't know—gives them lots of new ideas.  Also they find
they now worry obsessively about the status of their server.  (How
relaxing founders' lives must have been when startups wrote VisiCalc.)<br><br>By the end of month six, the system is starting to have a solid
core of features, and a small but devoted following.  People start
to write about it, and the founders are starting to feel like experts
in their field.<br><br>We'll assume that their startup is one that could put millions more
to use.  Perhaps they need to spend a lot on marketing, or build
some kind of expensive infrastructure, or hire highly paid salesmen.
So they decide to start talking to VCs.  They get introductions to
VCs from various sources: their angel investor connects them with
a couple; they meet a few at conferences; a couple VCs call them
after reading about them.<br><br><b>Step 3: Series A Round</b><br><br>Armed with their now somewhat fleshed-out business plan and able
to demo a real, working system, the founders visit the VCs they
have introductions to.  They find the VCs intimidating and inscrutable.
They all ask the same question: who else have you pitched to?  (VCs
are like high school girls: they're acutely aware of their position
in the VC pecking order, and their interest in a company is a
function of the interest other VCs show in it.)<br><br>One of the VC firms says they want to invest and offers the founders
a term sheet.  A term sheet is a summary of what the deal terms
will be when and if they do a deal; lawyers will fill in the details
later.  By accepting the term sheet, the startup agrees to turn
away other VCs for some set amount of time while this firm does the
"due diligence" required for the deal.  Due diligence is the corporate
equivalent of a background check: the purpose is to uncover any
hidden bombs that might sink the company later, like serious design
flaws in the product, pending lawsuits against the company,
intellectual property issues, and so on.  VCs' legal and financial
due diligence is pretty thorough, but the technical due diligence
is generally a joke.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>The due diligence discloses no ticking bombs, and six weeks later
they go ahead with the deal.  Here are the terms: a $2 million
investment at a pre-money valuation of $4 million, meaning that
after the deal closes the VCs will own a third of the company (2 /
(4 + 2)).  The VCs also insist that prior to the deal the option
pool be enlarged by an additional hundred shares.  So the total
number of new shares issued is 750, and the cap table becomes:
<xmp>
shareholder   shares    percent
-------------------------------
VCs             650       33.3
angel           200       10.3
uncle            50        2.6
each founder    250       12.8
employee         36*       1.8     *unvested
option pool     264       13.5
               ----      -----
total          1950      100
</xmp>
This picture is unrealistic in several respects.  For example, while
the percentages might end up looking like this, it's unlikely that
the VCs would keep the existing numbers of shares.  In fact, every
bit of the startup's paperwork would probably be replaced, as if
the company were being founded anew.  Also, the money might come
in several tranches, the later ones subject to various 
conditions—though this is apparently more common in deals with lower-tier VCs
(whose lot in life is to fund more dubious startups) than with the
top firms.<br><br>And of course any VCs reading this are probably rolling on the floor
laughing at how my hypothetical VCs let the angel keep his 10.3 of
the company.  I admit, this is the Bambi version; in simplifying
the picture, I've also made everyone nicer.  In the real world, VCs
regard angels the way a jealous husband feels about his wife's
previous boyfriends.  To them the company didn't exist before they
invested in it.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>I don't want to give the impression you have to do an angel round
before going to VCs.  In this example I stretched things out to
show multiple sources of funding in action. Some startups could go
directly from seed funding to a VC round; several of the companies
we've funded have.<br><br>The founders are required to vest their shares over four years, and
the board is now reconstituted to consist of two VCs, two founders,
and a fifth person acceptable to both. The angel investor cheerfully
surrenders his board seat.<br><br>At this point there is nothing new our startup can teach us about
funding—or at least, nothing good.   
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#777777">10</font></a>]</font>
The startup will almost
certainly hire more people at this point; those millions must be
put to work, after all.  The company may do additional funding
rounds, presumably at higher valuations.  They may if they are
extraordinarily fortunate do an IPO, which we should remember is
also in principle a round of funding, regardless of its de facto
purpose.  But that, if not beyond the bounds of possibility, is
beyond the scope of this article.<br><br><b>Deals Fall Through</b><br><br>Anyone who's been through a startup will find the preceding portrait
to be missing something: disasters.  If there's one thing all
startups have in common, it's that something is always going wrong.
And nowhere more than in matters of funding.<br><br>For example, our hypothetical startup never spent more than half
of one round before securing the next.  That's more ideal than
typical.  Many startups—even successful ones—come close to
running out of money at some point.  Terrible things happen to
startups when they run out of money, because they're designed for
growth, not adversity.<br><br>But the most unrealistic thing about the series of deals I've
described is that they all closed.  In the startup world, closing
is not what deals do.  What deals do is fall through.  If you're
starting a startup you would do well to remember that.  Birds fly;
fish swim; deals fall through.<br><br>Why?  Partly the reason deals seem to fall through so often is that
you lie to yourself.  You want the deal to close, so you start to
believe it will.  But even correcting for this, startup deals fall
through alarmingly often—far more often than, say, deals to buy
real estate.  The reason is that it's such a risky environment.
People about to fund or acquire a startup are prone to wicked cases
of buyer's remorse.  They don't really grasp the risk they're taking
till the deal's about to close.  And then they panic.  And not just
inexperienced angel investors, but big companies too.<br><br>So if you're a startup founder wondering why some angel investor
isn't returning your phone calls, you can at least take comfort in
the thought that the same thing is happening to other deals a hundred
times the size.<br><br>The example of a startup's history that I've presented is like a
skeleton—accurate so far as it goes, but needing to be fleshed
out to be a complete picture.  To get a complete picture, just add
in every possible disaster.<br><br>A frightening prospect?  In a way.  And yet also in a way encouraging.
The very uncertainty of startups frightens away almost everyone.
People overvalue stability—especially <a href="hiring.html">young</a>
people, who ironically need it least.  And so in starting a startup,
as in any really bold undertaking, merely deciding to do it gets
you halfway there.  On the day of the race, most of the other runners
won't show up.<br><br><br><br><br><br><xa href="http://reddit.com/vote?url=http://www.paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html"><ximg src="http://reddit.com/static/voteme.png" border="0" height="42" width="32">

The aim of such regulations is to protect widows and orphans
from crooked investment schemes; people with a million dollars in
liquid assets are assumed to be able to protect themselves.
The unintended consequence is that the investments that generate
the highest returns, like hedge funds, are available only to the
rich.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Consulting is where product companies go to die.  IBM is the
most famous example.  So starting as a consulting company is like
starting out in the grave and trying to work your way up into the
world of the living.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
If "near you" doesn't mean the Bay Area, Boston, or Seattle,
consider moving.  It's not a coincidence you haven't heard of many

Investors are often compared to sheep.  And they are like sheep,
but that's a rational response to their situation.  Sheep act the
way they do for a reason.  If all the other sheep head for a certain
field, it's probably good grazing.  And when a wolf appears, is he
going to eat a sheep in the middle of the flock, or one near the
edge?<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
This was partly confidence, and partly simple ignorance.  We
didn't know ourselves which VC firms were the impressive ones.  We
thought software was all that mattered.  But that turned out to be
the right direction to be naive in: it's much better to overestimate
than underestimate the importance of making a good product.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
I've omitted one source: government grants.  I don't think
these are even worth thinking about for the average startup.
Governments may mean well when they set up grant programs to encourage
startups, but what they give with one hand they take away with the
other: the process of applying is inevitably so arduous, and the
restrictions on what you can do with the money so burdensome, that
it would be easier to take a job to get the money.<br><br><!-- Here's an excerpt from an email I got from a German startup
founder:
<blockquote>
I recently got 50k EUR government funding for technological innovation (basically to buy software, computers and so on). I can't hire people 
on that money (except pay myself absolute minimum wage) and the money 
is spread over 18 months and arrives with a delay of 6 months. I can't 
spend money on my accountant, or any non-technology costs (can't buy 
chairs either). To solve my money problems and try to set my mind at 
ease, I have been thinking to do consultancy work for other people.
</blockquote> -->
You should be especially suspicious of grants whose purpose is some
kind of social engineering-- e.g. to encourage more startups to be
started in Mississippi.  Free money to start a startup in a place
where few succeed is hardly free.<br><br>Some government agencies run venture funding groups, which make
investments rather than giving grants.  For example, the CIA runs
a venture fund called In-Q-Tel that is modelled on private sector
funds and apparently generates good returns.  They would probably
be worth approaching—if you don't mind taking money from the CIA.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Options have largely been replaced with restricted stock, which
amounts to the same thing.  Instead of earning the right to buy
stock, the employee gets the stock up front, and earns the right
not to have to give it back.  The shares set aside for this purpose
are still called the "option pool."<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
First-rate technical people do not generally hire themselves
out to do due diligence for VCs.  So the most difficult
part for startup founders is often responding politely to the inane
questions of the "expert" they send to look you over.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
VCs regularly wipe out angels by issuing arbitrary amounts of
new stock.  They seem to have a standard piece of casuistry for
this situation: that the angels are no longer working to help the
company, and so don't deserve to keep their stock.  This of course
reflects a willful misunderstanding of what investment means; like
any investor, the angel is being compensated for risks he took
earlier.  By a similar logic, one could argue that the VCs should
be deprived of their shares when the company goes public.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
One new thing the company might encounter is a <i>down
round</i>, or a funding round at valuation lower than the previous
round.  Down rounds are bad news; it is generally the common stock
holders who take the hit.  Some of the most fearsome provisions in
VC deal terms have to do with down rounds—like "full ratchet
anti-dilution," which is as frightening as it sounds.<br><br>Founders are tempted to ignore these clauses, because they think
the company will either be a big success or a complete bust.  VCs
know otherwise: it's not uncommon for startups to have moments of
adversity before they ultimately succeed.  So it's worth negotiating
anti-dilution provisions, even though you don't think you need to,
and VCs will try to make you feel that you're being gratuitously
troublesome.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Hutch Fishman, Steve Huffman, Jessica

<p>
November 2005<br><br>Does "Web 2.0" mean anything?  Till recently I thought it didn't,
but the truth turns out to be more complicated.  Originally, yes,
it was meaningless.  Now it seems to have acquired a meaning.  And
yet those who dislike the term are probably right, because if it
means what I think it does, we don't need it.<br><br>I first heard the phrase "Web 2.0" in the name of the Web 2.0
conference in 2004.  At the time it was supposed to mean using "the
web as a platform," which I took to refer to web-based applications.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>So I was surprised at a conference this summer when Tim O'Reilly
led a session intended to figure out a definition of "Web 2.0."
Didn't it already mean using the web as a platform?  And if it
didn't already mean something, why did we need the phrase at all?<br><br><b>Origins</b><br><br>Tim says the phrase "Web 2.0" first
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20
.html">arose</a> in "a brainstorming session between
O'Reilly and Medialive International." What is Medialive International?
"Producers of technology tradeshows and conferences," according to
their site.  So presumably that's what this brainstorming session
was about.  O'Reilly wanted to organize a conference about the web,
and they were wondering what to call it.<br><br>I don't think there was any deliberate plan to suggest there was a
new <i>version</i> of the web.  They just wanted to make the point
that the web mattered again.  It was a kind of semantic deficit
spending: they knew new things were coming, and the "2.0" referred
to whatever those might turn out to be.<br><br>And they were right.  New things were coming.  But the new version
number led to some awkwardness in the short term.  In the process
of developing the pitch for the first conference, someone must have
decided they'd better take a stab at explaining what that "2.0"
referred to.  Whatever it meant, "the web as a platform" was at
least not too constricting.<br><br>The story about "Web 2.0" meaning the web as a platform didn't live
much past the first conference.  By the second conference, what
"Web 2.0" seemed to mean was something about democracy.  At least,
it did when people wrote about it online.  The conference itself
didn't seem very grassroots.  It cost $2800, so the only people who
could afford to go were VCs and people from big companies.<br><br>And yet, oddly enough, Ryan Singel's <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,69114,00.html">article</a>
about the conference in <i>Wired News</i> spoke of "throngs of
geeks."  When a friend of mine asked Ryan about this, it was news
to him.  He said he'd originally written something like "throngs
of VCs and biz dev guys" but had later shortened it just to "throngs,"
and that this must have in turn been expanded by the editors into
"throngs of geeks."  After all, a Web 2.0 conference would presumably
be full of geeks, right?<br><br>Well, no.  There were about 7.  Even Tim O'Reilly was wearing a   
suit, a sight so alien I couldn't parse it at first.  I saw
him walk by and said to one of the O'Reilly people "that guy looks
just like Tim."<br><br>"Oh, that's Tim.  He bought a suit."
I ran after him, and sure enough, it was.  He explained that he'd
just bought it in Thailand.<br><br>The 2005 Web 2.0 conference reminded me of Internet trade shows
during the Bubble, full of prowling VCs looking for the next hot
startup.  There was that same odd atmosphere created by a large  
number of people determined not to miss out.  Miss out on what?
They didn't know.  Whatever was going to happen—whatever Web 2.0
turned out to be.<br><br>I wouldn't quite call it "Bubble 2.0" just because VCs are eager
to invest again.  The Internet is a genuinely big deal.  The bust
was as much an <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/bubble.html">overreaction</a> as
the boom.  It's to be expected that once we started to pull out of
the bust, there would be a lot of growth in this area, just as there
was in the industries that spiked the sharpest before the Depression.<br><br>The reason this won't turn into a second Bubble is that the IPO
market is gone.  <a href="startupfunding.html">Venture investors</a>
are driven by exit strategies.  The reason they were funding all  
those laughable startups during the late 90s was that they hoped
to sell them to gullible retail investors; they hoped to be laughing
all the way to the bank.  Now that route is closed.  Now the default
exit strategy is to get bought, and acquirers are less prone to
irrational exuberance than IPO investors.  The closest you'll get 
to Bubble valuations is Rupert Murdoch paying $580 million for   
Myspace.  That's only off by a factor of 10 or so.<br><br><b>1. Ajax</b><br><br>Does "Web 2.0" mean anything more than the name of a conference
yet?  I don't like to admit it, but it's starting to.  When people
say "Web 2.0" now, I have some idea what they mean.  And the fact
that I both despise the phrase and understand it is the surest proof
that it has started to mean something.<br><br>One ingredient of its meaning is certainly Ajax, which I can still
only just bear to use without scare quotes.  Basically, what "Ajax"
means is "Javascript now works."  And that in turn means that
web-based applications can now be made to work much more like desktop
ones.<br><br>As you read this, a whole new <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB113098635587487074.html?mod=todays_
free_feature">generation</a>
of software is being written to take advantage of Ajax.  There
hasn't been such a wave of new applications since microcomputers
first appeared.  Even Microsoft sees it, but it's too late for them
to do anything more than <a href="http://www.hypercamp.org/2005/11/09">leak</a> "internal"  
documents designed to give the impression they're on top of this
new trend.<br><br>In fact the new generation of software is being written way too
fast for Microsoft even to channel it, let alone write their own
in house.  Their only hope now is to buy all the best Ajax startups
before Google does.  And even that's going to be hard, because
Google has as big a head start in buying microstartups as it did
in search a few years ago.  After all, Google Maps, the canonical
Ajax application, was the result of a startup they <a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2005/10/google-maps-lead-engineer-gaze
s-into.html">bought</a>.<br><br>So ironically the original description of the Web 2.0 conference
turned out to be partially right: web-based applications are a big
component of Web 2.0.  But I'm convinced they got this right by 
accident.  The Ajax boom didn't start till early 2005, when Google
Maps appeared and the term "Ajax" was <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">coined</a>.<br><br><b>2. Democracy</b><br><br>The second big element of Web 2.0 is democracy.  We now have several
examples to prove that <a href="opensource.html">amateurs</a> can   
surpass professionals, when they have the right kind of system to 
channel their efforts.  <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>
may be the most famous.  Experts have given Wikipedia middling
reviews, but they miss the critical point: it's good enough.  And   
it's free, which means people actually read it.  On the web, articles
you have to pay for might as well not exist.  Even if you were    
willing to pay to read them yourself, you can't link to them.    
They're not part of the conversation.<br><br>Another place democracy seems to win is in deciding what counts as
news.  I never look at any news site now except <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>
 I know if something major
happens, or someone writes a particularly interesting article, it   
will show up there.  Why bother checking the front page of any
specific paper or magazine?  Reddit's like an RSS feed for the whole
web, with a filter for quality.  Similar sites include <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a>, a technology news site that's
rapidly approaching Slashdot in popularity, and <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, the collaborative
bookmarking network that set off the "tagging" movement.  And whereas
Wikipedia's main appeal is that it's good enough and free, these
sites suggest that voters do a significantly better job than human
editors.<br><br>The most dramatic example of Web 2.0 democracy is not in the selection
of ideas, but their production.  <!-- Usage has not yet evolved to reflect
this: the only phrases we have to describe the phenomenon are ones 
that implicitly assume the superiority of the old order, like
"user-generated content," or "blogging" (neutral in itself, but 
revealingly condescending in its over-broad use).
-->
I've noticed for a while that the stuff I read on individual people's
sites is as good as or better than the stuff I read in newspapers
and magazines.  And now I have independent evidence: the top links
on Reddit are generally links to individual people's sites rather  
than to magazine articles or news stories.<br><br>My experience of writing
for magazines suggests an explanation.  Editors.  They control the
topics you can write about, and they can generally rewrite whatever
you produce.  The result is to damp extremes.  Editing yields 95th
percentile writing—95% of articles are improved by it, but 5% are
dragged down.  5% of the time you get "throngs of geeks."<br><br>On the web, people can publish whatever they want.  Nearly all of
it falls short of the editor-damped writing in print publications.
But the pool of writers is very, very large.  If it's large enough,
the lack of damping means the best writing online should surpass  
the best in print.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>  
And now that the web has evolved mechanisms
for selecting good stuff, the web wins net.  Selection beats damping,
for the same reason market economies beat centrally planned ones.<br><br>Even the startups are different this time around.  They are to the  
startups of the Bubble what bloggers are to the print media.  During
the Bubble, a startup meant a company headed by an MBA that was   
blowing through several million dollars of VC money to "get big
fast" in the most literal sense.  Now it means a smaller, <a href="hiring.html">younger</a>, more technical group that just      
decided to make something great.  They'll decide later if they want  
to raise VC-scale funding, and if they take it, they'll take it on
<a href="vcsqueeze.html">their terms</a>.<br><br><b>3. Don't Maltreat Users</b><br><br>I think everyone would agree that democracy and Ajax are elements
of "Web 2.0."  I also see a third: not to maltreat users.  During
the Bubble a lot of popular sites were quite high-handed with users.
And not just in obvious ways, like making them register, or subjecting
them to annoying ads.  The very design of the average site in the   
late 90s was an abuse.  Many of the most popular sites were loaded
with obtrusive branding that made them slow to load and sent the
user the message: this is our site, not yours.  (There's a physical
analog in the Intel and Microsoft <a href="designedforwindows.html">stickers</a> that come on some
laptops.)<br><br>I think the root of the problem was that sites felt they were giving
something away for free, and till recently a company giving anything
away for free could be pretty high-handed about it.  Sometimes it
reached the point of economic sadism: site owners assumed that the
more pain they caused the user, the more benefit it must be to them.  
The most dramatic remnant of this model may be at salon.com, where   
you can read the beginning of a story, but to get the rest you have
sit through a <i>movie</i>.<br><br>At Y Combinator we advise all the startups we fund never to lord
it over users.  Never make users register, unless you need to in
order to store something for them.  If you do make users register,   
never make them wait for a confirmation link in an email; in fact,
don't even ask for their email address unless you need it for some
reason.  Don't ask them any unnecessary questions.  Never send them
email unless they explicitly ask for it.  Never frame pages you
link to, or open them in new windows.  If you have a free version 
and a pay version, don't make the free version too restricted.  And
if you find yourself asking "should we allow users to do x?" just 
answer "yes" whenever you're unsure.  Err on the side of generosity.<br><br>In <a href="start.html">How to Start a Startup</a> I advised startups
never to let anyone fly under them, meaning never to let any other
company offer a cheaper, easier solution.  Another way to fly low 
is to give users more power.  Let users do what they want.  If you 
don't and a competitor does, you're in trouble.<br><br>iTunes is Web 2.0ish in this sense.  Finally you can buy individual
songs instead of having to buy whole albums.  The recording industry
hated the idea and resisted it as long as possible.  But it was
obvious what users wanted, so Apple flew under the labels.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
Though really it might be better to describe iTunes as Web 1.5.     
Web 2.0 applied to music would probably mean individual bands giving
away DRMless songs for free.<br><br>The ultimate way to be nice to users is to give them something for
free that competitors charge for.  During the 90s a lot of people   
probably thought we'd have some working system for micropayments     
by now.  In fact things have gone in the other direction.  The most   
successful sites are the ones that figure out new ways to give stuff
away for free.  Craigslist has largely destroyed the classified ad
sites of the 90s, and OkCupid looks likely to do the same to the
previous generation of dating sites.<br><br>Serving web pages is very, very cheap.  If you can make even a   
fraction of a cent per page view, you can make a profit.  And
technology for targeting ads continues to improve.  I wouldn't be
surprised if ten years from now eBay had been supplanted by an      
ad-supported freeBay (or, more likely, gBay).<br><br>Odd as it might sound, we tell startups that they should try to
make as little money as possible.  If you can figure out a way to
turn a billion dollar industry into a fifty million dollar industry,
so much the better, if all fifty million go to you.  Though indeed,
making things cheaper often turns out to generate more money in the
end, just as automating things often turns out to generate more
jobs.<br><br>The ultimate target is Microsoft.  What a bang that balloon is going
to make when someone pops it by offering a free web-based alternative 
to MS Office.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font>
Who will?  Google?  They seem to be taking their
time.  I suspect the pin will be wielded by a couple of 20 year old
hackers who are too naive to be intimidated by the idea.  (How hard
can it be?)<br><br><b>The Common Thread</b><br><br>Ajax, democracy, and not dissing users.  What do they all have in  
common?  I didn't realize they had anything in common till recently,
which is one of the reasons I disliked the term "Web 2.0" so much.
It seemed that it was being used as a label for whatever happened
to be new—that it didn't predict anything.<br><br>But there is a common thread.  Web 2.0 means using the web the way
it's meant to be used.  The "trends" we're seeing now are simply
the inherent nature of the web emerging from under the broken models
that got imposed on it during the Bubble.<br><br>I realized this when I read an <!-- as-yet unpublished--> interview with
Joe Kraus, the co-founder of Excite.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font>
</p><blockquote>
  Excite really never got the business model right at all.  We fell 
  into the classic problem of how when a new medium comes out it
  adopts the practices, the content, the business models of the old
  medium—which fails, and then the more appropriate models get
  figured out.
</blockquote>
It may have seemed as if not much was happening during the years
after the Bubble burst.  But in retrospect, something was happening:
the web was finding its natural angle of repose.  The democracy 
component, for example—that's not an innovation, in the sense of
something someone made happen.  That's what the web naturally tends
to produce.<br><br>Ditto for the idea of delivering desktop-like applications over the
web.  That idea is almost as old as the web.  But the first time    
around it was co-opted by Sun, and we got Java applets.  Java has
since been remade into a generic replacement for C++, but in 1996
the story about Java was that it represented a new model of software.
Instead of desktop applications, you'd run Java "applets" delivered
from a server.<br><br>This plan collapsed under its own weight. Microsoft helped kill it,
but it would have died anyway.  There was no uptake among hackers.
When you find <a href="submarine.html">PR firms</a> promoting
something as the next development platform, you can be sure it's
not.  If it were, you wouldn't need PR firms to tell you, because   
hackers would already be writing stuff on top of it, the way sites    
like <a href="http://busmonster.com">Busmonster</a> used Google Maps as a
platform before Google even meant it to be one.<br><br>The proof that Ajax is the next hot platform is that thousands of  
hackers have spontaneously started building things on top
of it.  Mikey likes it.<br><br>There's another thing all three components of Web 2.0 have in common.
Here's a clue.  Suppose you approached investors with the following
idea for a Web 2.0 startup:
<blockquote>
  Sites like del.icio.us and flickr allow users to "tag" content
  with descriptive tokens.  But there is also huge source of
  <i>implicit</i> tags that they ignore: the text within web links.
  Moreover, these links represent a social network connecting the   
  individuals and organizations who created the pages, and by using
  graph theory we can compute from this network an estimate of the
  reputation of each member.  We plan to mine the web for these 
  implicit tags, and use them together with the reputation hierarchy
  they embody to enhance web searches.
</blockquote>
How long do you think it would take them on average to realize that
it was a description of Google?<br><br>Google was a pioneer in all three components of Web 2.0: their core
business sounds crushingly hip when described in Web 2.0 terms, 
"Don't maltreat users" is a subset of "Don't be evil," and of course
Google set off the whole Ajax boom with Google Maps.<br><br>Web 2.0 means using the web as it was meant to be used, and Google
does.  That's their secret.  <!-- The web naturally has a certain grain,
and Google is aligned with it.  That's why their success seems so   
effortless.-->  They're sailing with the wind, instead of sitting  
becalmed praying for a business model, like the print media, or   
trying to tack upwind by suing their customers, like Microsoft and 
the record labels.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Google doesn't try to force things to happen their way.  They try   
to figure out what's going to happen, and arrange to be standing 
there when it does.  That's the way to approach technology—and 
as business includes an ever larger technological component, the
right way to do business.<br><br>The fact that Google is a "Web 2.0" company shows that, while
meaningful, the term is also rather bogus.  It's like the word
"allopathic."  It just means doing things right, and it's a bad   
sign when you have a special word for that.<br><br><br><br>

the web and enables a new generation of services and business

So could it be that procrastination isn't always bad?<br><br>Most people who write about procrastination write about how to cure
it.  But this is, strictly speaking, impossible.  There are an
infinite number of things you could be doing.  No matter what you
work on, you're not working on everything else.  So the question
is not how to avoid procrastination, but how to procrastinate well.<br><br>There are three variants of procrastination, depending on what you
do instead of working on something: you could work on (a) nothing,
(b) something less important, or (c) something more important.  That
last type, I'd argue, is good procrastination.<br><br>That's the "absent-minded professor," who forgets to shave, or eat,
or even perhaps look where he's going while he's thinking about
some interesting question.   His mind is absent from the everyday
world because it's hard at work in another.<br><br>That's the sense in which the most impressive people I know are all
procrastinators.  They're type-C procrastinators:  they put off
working on small stuff to work on big stuff.<br><br>What's "small stuff?"  Roughly, work that has zero chance of being
mentioned in your obituary.  It's hard to say at the time what will
turn out to be your best work (will it be your magnum opus on
Sumerian temple architecture, or the detective thriller you wrote
under a pseudonym?), but there's a whole class of tasks you can
safely rule out: shaving, doing your laundry, cleaning the house,
writing thank-you notes—anything that might be called an errand.<br><br>Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work.<br><br>Good in a sense, at least.  The people who want you to do the errands
won't think it's good.  But you probably have to annoy them if you
want to get anything done.  The mildest seeming people, if they
want to do real work, all have a certain degree of ruthlessness
when it comes to avoiding errands.<br><br>Some errands, like replying to letters, go away if you
ignore them (perhaps taking friends with them).  Others, like mowing
the lawn, or filing tax returns, only get worse if you put them
off.  In principle it shouldn't work to put off the second kind of
errand.  You're going to have to do whatever it is eventually.  Why
not (as past-due notices are always saying) do it now?<br><br>The reason it pays to put off even those errands is that real work
needs two things errands don't: big chunks of time, and the
right mood.  If you get inspired by some project, it can be a net
win to blow off everything you were supposed to do for the next few
days to work on it.  Yes, those errands may cost you more time when
you finally get around to them.  But if you get a lot done during
those few days, you will be net more productive.<br><br>In fact, it may not be a difference in degree, but a difference in
kind.  There may be types of work that can only be done in long,
uninterrupted stretches, when inspiration hits, rather than dutifully
in scheduled little slices.  Empirically it seems to be so.  When
I think of the people I know who've done great things, I don't
imagine them dutifully crossing items off to-do lists.  I imagine
them sneaking off to work on some new idea.<br><br>Conversely, forcing someone to perform errands synchronously is
bound to limit their productivity.  The cost of an interruption is
not just the time it takes, but that it breaks the time on either
side in half.  You probably only have to interrupt someone a couple
times a day before they're unable to work on hard problems at all.<br><br>I've wondered a lot about why 
<a href="start.html">startups</a> are most productive at the
very beginning, when they're just a couple guys in an apartment.
The main reason may be that there's no one to interrupt them yet.
In theory it's good when the founders finally get enough money to
hire people to do some of the work for them.  But it may be better
to be overworked than interrupted.  Once you dilute a startup with
ordinary office workers—with type-B procrastinators—the whole
company starts to resonate at their frequency.  They're interrupt-driven,
and soon you are too.<br><br>Errands are so effective at killing great projects that a lot of
people use them for that purpose.  Someone who has decided to write
a novel, for example, will suddenly find that the house needs
cleaning. People who fail to write novels don't do it by sitting
in front of a blank page for days without writing anything.  They
do it by feeding the cat, going out to buy something they need for
their apartment, meeting a friend for coffee, checking email.  "I
don't have time to work," they say.  And they don't; they've made
sure of that.<br><br>(There's also a variant where one has no place to work.  The cure
is to visit the places where famous people worked, and see how
unsuitable they were.)<br><br>I've used both these excuses at one time or another.  I've learned
a lot of tricks for making myself work over the last 20 years, but
even now I don't win consistently.  Some days I get real work done.
Other days are eaten up by errands.  And I know it's usually my
fault: I <i>let</i> errands eat up the day, to avoid
facing some hard problem.<br><br>The most dangerous form of procrastination is unacknowledged type-B
procrastination, because it doesn't feel like procrastination.
You're "getting things done."  Just the wrong things.<br><br>Any advice about procrastination that concentrates on crossing
things off your to-do list is not only incomplete, but positively
misleading, if it doesn't consider the possibility that the to-do
list is itself a form of type-B procrastination.  In fact, possibility
is too weak a word.  Nearly everyone's is.  Unless you're working
on the biggest things you could be working on, you're type-B
procrastinating, no matter how much you're getting done.<br><br>In his famous essay <a href="hamming.html">You and Your Research</a> 
(which I recommend to
anyone ambitious, no matter what they're working on), Richard Hamming
suggests that you ask yourself three questions:
<ol>
<li> What are the most important problems in your field?<br><br></li><li> Are you working on one of them?<br><br></li><li> Why not?
</li></ol>
Hamming was at Bell Labs when he started asking such questions.  In
principle anyone there ought to have been able to work on the most
important problems in their field.  Perhaps not everyone can make
an equally dramatic mark on the world; I don't know; but whatever
your capacities, there are projects that stretch them.  So Hamming's
exercise can be generalized to:
<blockquote>
  What's the best thing you could be working on, and why aren't
  you?
</blockquote>
Most people will shy away from this question.  I shy away from it
myself; I see it there on the page and quickly move on to the next
sentence.  Hamming used to go around actually asking people this,
and it didn't make him popular.  But it's a question anyone ambitious
should face.<br><br>The trouble is, you may end up hooking a very big fish with this
bait.  To do good work, you need to do more than find good projects.
Once you've found them, you have to get yourself to work on them,
and that can be hard.  The bigger the problem, the harder it is to
get yourself to work on it.<br><br>Of course, the main reason people find it difficult to work on a
particular problem is that they don't 
<a href="hs.html">enjoy</a> it.  When you're young,
especially, you often find yourself working on stuff you don't
really like-- because it seems impressive, for example, or because
you've been assigned to work on it.  Most grad students are stuck
working on big problems they don't really like, and grad school is
thus synonymous with procrastination.<br><br>But even when you like what you're working on, it's easier to get
yourself to work on small problems than big ones.  Why?  Why is it
so hard to work on big problems?  One reason is that you may not
get any reward in the forseeable future.  If you work on something
you can finish in a day or two, you can expect to have a nice feeling
of accomplishment fairly soon.  If the reward is indefinitely far
in the future, it seems less real.<br><br>Another reason people don't work on big projects is, ironically,
fear of wasting time.  What if they fail?  Then all the time they
spent on it will be wasted.  (In fact it probably won't be, because
work on hard projects almost always leads somewhere.)<br><br>But the trouble with big problems can't be just that they promise
no immediate reward and might cause you to waste a lot of time.  If
that were all, they'd be no worse than going to visit your in-laws.
There's more to it than that.  Big problems are <i>terrifying</i>.
There's an almost physical pain in facing them.  It's like having
a vacuum cleaner hooked up to your imagination.   All your initial
ideas get sucked out immediately, and you don't have any more, and
yet the vacuum cleaner is still sucking.<br><br>You can't look a big problem too directly in the eye. You have to
approach it somewhat obliquely.  But you have to adjust the angle
just right: you have to be facing the big problem directly enough
that you catch some of the excitement radiating from it, but not
so much that it paralyzes you.  You can tighten the angle once you
get going, just as a sailboat can sail closer to the wind once it
gets underway.<br><br>If you want to work on big things, you seem to have to trick yourself
into doing it.  You have to work on small things that could grow
into big things, or work on successively larger things, or split
the moral load with collaborators.  It's not a sign of weakness to
depend on such tricks.  The very best work has been done this way.<br><br>When I talk to people who've managed to make themselves work on big
things, I find that all blow off errands, and all feel guilty about
it.  I don't think they should feel guilty.  There's more to do
than anyone could.  So someone doing the best work they can is
inevitably going to leave a lot of errands undone.  It seems a
mistake to feel bad about that.<br><br>I think the way to "solve" the problem of procrastination is to let
delight pull you instead of making a to-do list push you.  Work on
an ambitious project you really enjoy, and sail as close to the
wind as you can, and you'll leave the right things undone.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert

<p>
January 2006<br><br>To do something well you have to like it.   That idea is not exactly
novel.  We've got it down to four words: "Do what you love."  But
it's not enough just to tell people that.  Doing what you love is
complicated.<br><br>The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids.  When I
was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition.
Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do
things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could
do what you wanted, and that was called playing.  Occasionally the
things adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing
wasn't — for example, if you fell and hurt yourself.  But except
for these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as
not-fun.<br><br>And it did not seem to be an accident. School, it was implied, was
tedious <i>because</i> it was preparation for grownup work.<br><br>The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids.
Grownups, like some kind of cursed race, had to work.  Kids didn't,
but they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of
work meant to prepare us for the real thing.  Much as we disliked
school, the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, and
that we had it easy.<br><br>Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work
was not fun.  Which is not surprising: work wasn't fun for most of
them.  Why did we have to memorize state capitals instead of playing
dodgeball?  For the same reason they had to watch over a bunch of
kids instead of lying on a beach.  You couldn't just do what you
wanted.<br><br>I'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want.
They may have to be made to work on certain things.  But if we make
kids work on dull stuff, it might be wise to tell them that tediousness
is not the defining quality of work, and indeed that the reason
they have to work on dull stuff now is so they can work on more
interesting stuff later.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever
I wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it.  I remember that
precisely because it seemed so anomalous.  It was like being told
to use dry water.  Whatever I thought he meant, I didn't think he
meant work could <i>literally</i> be fun — fun like playing.  It
took me years to grasp that.<br><br><b>Jobs</b><br><br>By high school, the prospect of an actual job was on the horizon.
Adults would sometimes come to speak to us about their work, or we
would go to see them at work.  It was always understood that they
enjoyed what they did.  In retrospect I think one may have: the
private jet pilot.  But I don't think the bank manager really did.<br><br>The main reason they all acted as if they enjoyed their work was
presumably the upper-middle class convention that you're supposed
to.  It would not merely be bad for your career to say that you
despised your job, but a social faux-pas.<br><br>Why is it conventional to pretend to like what you do?  The first
sentence of this essay explains that.  If you have to like something
to do it well, then the most successful people will all like what
they do.  That's where the upper-middle class tradition comes from.
Just as houses all over America are full of 
<a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=louis%20xv%20chair">chairs</a>
that are, without
the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of chairs designed
250 years ago for French kings, conventional attitudes about work
are, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of
the attitudes of people who've done great things.<br><br>What a recipe for alienation.  By the time they reach an age to
think about what they'd like to do, most kids have been thoroughly
misled about the idea of loving one's work.  School has trained
them to regard work as an unpleasant duty.  Having a job is said
to be even more onerous than schoolwork.  And yet all the adults
claim to like what they do.  You can't blame kids for thinking "I
am not like these people; I am not suited to this world."<br><br>Actually they've been told three lies: the stuff they've been taught
to regard as work in school is not real work; grownup work is not
(necessarily) worse than schoolwork; and many of the adults around
them are lying when they say they like what they do.<br><br>The most dangerous liars can be the kids' own parents.  If you take
a boring job to give your family a high standard of living, as so
many people do, you risk infecting your kids with the idea that
work is boring. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>
Maybe it would be better for kids in this one
case if parents were not so unselfish.  A parent who set an example
of loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive
house.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>It was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally broke
free from the idea of making a living.  Then the important question
became not how to make money, but what to work on.  Ideally these
coincided, but some spectacular boundary cases (like Einstein in
the patent office) proved they weren't identical.<br><br>The definition of work was now to make some original contribution
to the world, and in the process not to starve.  But after the habit
of so many years my idea of work still included a large component
of pain.  Work still seemed to require discipline, because only
hard problems yielded grand results, and hard problems couldn't
literally be fun.   Surely one had to force oneself to work on them.<br><br>If you think something's supposed to hurt, you're less likely to
notice if you're doing it wrong.  That about sums up my experience
of graduate school.<br><br><b>Bounds</b><br><br><i>How much</i> are you supposed to like what you do?  Unless you
know that, you don't know when to stop searching. And if, like most
people, you underestimate it, you'll tend to stop searching too
early.  You'll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents,
or the desire to make money, or prestige — or sheer inertia.<br><br>Here's an upper bound: Do what you love doesn't mean, do what you
would like to do most <i>this second</i>.  Even Einstein probably
had moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told himself
he ought to finish what he was working on first.<br><br>It used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what they
did so much that there was nothing they'd rather do.  There didn't
seem to be any sort of work I liked <i>that</i> much.  If I had a
choice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b)
be teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was
there any sort of work I'd prefer?  Honestly, no.<br><br>But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment,
float about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious
food, than work on hard problems.  The rule about doing what you
love assumes a certain length of time.  It doesn't mean, do what
will make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest
over some longer period, like a week or a month.<br><br>Unproductive pleasures pall eventually.  After a while you get tired
of lying on the beach.  If you want to stay happy, you have to do
something.<br><br>As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive
pleasure.  You have to like what you do enough that the concept of
"spare time" seems mistaken.  Which is not to say you have to spend
all your time working.  You can only work so much before you get
tired and start to screw up.  Then you want to do something else
— even something mindless.  But you don't regard this time as the
prize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn
it.<br><br>I put the lower bound there for practical reasons.  If your work
is not your favorite thing to do, you'll have terrible problems
with procrastination.  You'll have to force yourself to work,  and
when you resort to that the results are distinctly inferior.<br><br>To be happy I think you have to be doing something you not only
enjoy, but admire.  You have to be able to say, at the end, wow,
that's pretty cool.  This doesn't mean you have to make something.
If you learn how to hang glide, or to speak a foreign language
fluently, that will be enough to make you say, for a while at least,
wow, that's pretty cool.  What there has to be is a test.<br><br>So one thing that falls just short of the standard, I think, is
reading books.  Except for some books in math and the hard sciences,
there's no test of how well you've read a book, and that's why
merely reading books doesn't quite feel like work.  You have to do
something with what you've read to feel productive.<br><br>I think the best test is one Gino Lee taught me: to try to do things
that would make your friends say wow.  But it probably wouldn't
start to work properly till about age 22, because most people haven't
had a big enough sample to pick friends from before then.<br><br><b>Sirens</b><br><br>What you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of
anyone beyond your friends.  You shouldn't worry about prestige.
Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world.  When you can ask
the opinions of people whose judgement you respect, what does it
add to consider the opinions of people you don't even know? 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>This is easy advice to give.  It's hard to follow, especially when
you're young.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font>
Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps
even your beliefs about what you enjoy.  It causes you to work not
on what you like, but what you'd like to like.<br><br>That's what leads people to try to write novels, for example.  They
like reading novels.  They notice that people who write them win
Nobel prizes.  What could be more wonderful, they think, than to
be a novelist?  But liking the idea of being a novelist is not
enough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you're
going to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate lies.<br><br>Prestige is just fossilized inspiration.  If you do anything well
enough, you'll <i>make</i> it prestigious.  Plenty of things we now
consider prestigious were anything but at first.  Jazz comes to
mind — though almost any established art form would do.   So just
do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself.<br><br>Prestige is especially dangerous to the ambitious.  If you want to
make ambitious people waste their time on errands, the way to do
it is to bait the hook with prestige.  That's the recipe for getting
people to give talks, write forewords, serve on committees, be
department heads, and so on.  It might be a good rule simply to
avoid any prestigious task. If it didn't suck, they wouldn't have
had to make it prestigious.<br><br>Similarly, if you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is more
prestigious, you should probably choose the other.  Your opinions
about what's admirable are always going to be slightly influenced
by prestige, so if the two seem equal to you, you probably have
more genuine admiration for the less prestigious one.<br><br>The other big force leading people astray is money.  Money by itself
is not that dangerous.  When something pays well but is regarded
with contempt, like telemarketing, or prostitution, or personal
injury litigation, ambitious people aren't tempted by it.  That
kind of work ends up being done by people who are "just trying to
make a living."  (Tip: avoid any field whose practitioners say
this.)  The danger is when money is combined with prestige, as in,
say, corporate law, or medicine.  A comparatively safe and prosperous
career with some automatic baseline prestige is dangerously tempting
to someone young, who hasn't thought much about what they really
like.<br><br>The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do
it even if they weren't paid for it — even if they had to work at
another job to make a living.  How many corporate lawyers would do
their current work if they had to do it for free, in their spare
time, and take day jobs as waiters to support themselves?<br><br>This test is especially helpful in deciding between different kinds
of academic work, because fields vary greatly in this respect.  Most
good mathematicians would work on math even if there were no jobs
as math professors, whereas in the departments at the other end of
the spectrum, the availability of teaching jobs is the driver:
people would rather be English professors than work in ad agencies,
and publishing papers is the way you compete for such jobs.  Math
would happen without math departments, but it is the existence of
English majors, and therefore jobs teaching them, that calls into
being all those thousands of dreary papers about gender and identity
in the novels of Conrad.  No one does 
<a href="http://www.google.com/scholar?q=gender+identity+narrative+discourse+transcend">that</a> 
kind of thing for fun.<br><br>The advice of parents will tend to err on the side of money.  It
seems safe to say there are more undergrads who want to be novelists
and whose parents want them to be doctors than who want to be doctors
and whose parents want them to be novelists.  The kids think their
parents are "materialistic." Not necessarily.  All parents tend to
be more conservative for their kids than they would for themselves,
simply because, as parents, they share risks more than rewards.  If
your eight year old son decides to climb a tall tree, or your teenage
daughter decides to date the local bad boy, you won't get a share
in the excitement, but if your son falls, or your daughter gets
pregnant, you'll have to deal with the consequences.<br><br><b>Discipline</b><br><br>With such powerful forces leading us astray, it's not surprising
we find it so hard to discover what we like to work on.  Most people
are doomed in childhood by accepting the axiom that work = pain.
Those who escape this are nearly all lured onto the rocks by prestige
or money.  How many even discover something they love to work on?
A few hundred thousand, perhaps, out of billions.<br><br>It's hard to find work you love; it must be, if so few do.  So don't
underestimate this task.  And don't feel bad if you haven't succeeded
yet.  In fact, if you admit to yourself that you're discontented,
you're a step ahead of most people, who are still in denial.  If
you're surrounded by colleagues who claim to enjoy work that you
find contemptible, odds are they're lying to themselves.  Not
necessarily, but probably.<br><br>Although doing great work takes less discipline than people think — because the way to do great work is to find something you like so
much that you don't have to force yourself to do it — <i>finding</i>
work you love does usually require discipline.   Some people are
lucky enough to know what they want to do when they're 12, and just
glide along as if they were on railroad tracks.  But this seems the
exception.  More often people who do great things have careers with
the trajectory of a ping-pong ball.  They go to school to study A,
drop out and get a job doing B, and then become famous for C after
taking it up on the side.<br><br>Sometimes jumping from one sort of work to another is a sign of
energy, and sometimes it's a sign of laziness.  Are you dropping
out, or boldly carving a new path?  You often can't tell yourself.
Plenty of people who will later do great things seem to be disappointments
early on, when they're trying to find their niche.<br><br>Is there some test you can use to keep yourself honest?  One is to
try to do a good job at whatever you're doing, even if you don't
like it.  Then at least you'll know you're not using dissatisfaction
as an excuse for being lazy.  Perhaps more importantly, you'll get
into the habit of doing things well.<br><br>Another test you can use is: always produce.  For example, if you
have a day job you don't take seriously because you plan to be a
novelist, are you producing?  Are you writing pages of fiction,
however bad?  As long as you're producing, you'll know you're not
merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write
one day as an opiate.  The view of it will be obstructed by the all
too palpably flawed one you're actually writing.<br><br>"Always produce" is also a heuristic for finding the work you love.
If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically
push you away from things you think you're supposed to work on,
toward things you actually like.  "Always produce" will discover
your life's work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the
hole in your roof.<br><br>Of course, figuring out what you like to work on doesn't mean you
get to work on it.  That's a separate question.  And if you're
ambitious you have to keep them separate: you have to make a conscious
effort to keep your ideas about what you want from being contaminated
by what seems possible. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>It's painful to keep them apart, because it's painful to observe
the gap between them. So most people pre-emptively lower their
expectations.  For example, if you asked random people on the street
if they'd like to be able to draw like Leonardo, you'd find most
would say something like "Oh, I can't draw."  This is more a statement
of intention than fact; it means, I'm not going to try.  Because
the fact is, if you took a random person off the street and somehow
got them to work as hard as they possibly could at drawing for the
next twenty years, they'd get surprisingly far.  But it would require
a great moral effort; it would mean staring failure in the eye every
day for years.  And so to protect themselves people say "I can't."<br><br>Another related line you often hear is that not everyone can do
work they love — that someone has to do the unpleasant jobs.  Really?
How do you make them?  In the US the only mechanism for forcing
people to do unpleasant jobs is the draft, and that hasn't been
invoked for over 30 years.  All we can do is encourage people to
do unpleasant work, with money and prestige.<br><br>If there's something people still won't do, it seems as if society
just has to make do without.  That's what happened with domestic
servants.  For millennia that was the canonical example of a job
"someone had to do."  And yet in the mid twentieth century servants
practically disappeared in rich countries, and the rich have just
had to do without.<br><br>So while there may be some things someone has to do, there's a good
chance anyone saying that about any particular job is mistaken.
Most unpleasant jobs would either get automated or go undone if no
one were willing to do them.<br><br><b>Two Routes</b><br><br>There's another sense of "not everyone can do work they love"
that's all too true, however.  One has to make a living, and it's
hard to get paid for doing work you love.  There are two routes to
that destination:
</p><blockquote>
  The organic route: as you become more eminent, gradually to
  increase the parts of your job that you like at the expense of
  those you don't.<br><br>The two-job route: to work at things you don't like to get money
  to work on things you do.
</blockquote>
The organic route is more common.  It happens naturally to anyone
who does good work.  A young architect has to take whatever work
he can get, but if he does well he'll gradually be in a position
to pick and choose among projects.  The disadvantage of this route
is that it's slow and uncertain.  Even tenure is not real freedom.<br><br>The two-job route has several variants depending on how long you
work for money at a time.  At one extreme is the "day job," where
you work regular hours at one job to make money, and work on what
you love in your spare time.  At the other extreme you work at
something till you make <a href="wealth.html">enough</a> not to 
have to work for money again.<br><br>The two-job route is less common than the organic route, because
it requires a deliberate choice.  It's also more dangerous.  Life
tends to get more expensive as you get older, so it's easy to get
sucked into working longer than you expected at the money job.
Worse still, anything you work on changes you.  If you work too
long on tedious stuff, it will rot your brain.  And the best paying
jobs are most dangerous, because they require your full attention.<br><br>The advantage of the two-job route is that it lets you jump over
obstacles.  The landscape of possible jobs isn't flat; there are
walls of varying heights between different kinds of work.

The trick of maximizing the parts of your job that you like can get you
from architecture to product design, but not, probably, to music.
If you make money doing one thing and then work on another, you
have more freedom of choice.<br><br>Which route should you take?  That depends on how sure you are of
what you want to do, how good you are at taking orders, how much
risk you can stand, and the odds that anyone will pay (in your
lifetime) for what you want to do.  If you're sure of the general
area you want to work in and it's something people are likely to
pay you for, then you should probably take the organic route.  But
if you don't know what you want to work on, or don't like to take
orders, you may want to take the two-job route, if you can stand
the risk.<br><br>Don't decide too soon.  Kids who know early what they want to do
seem impressive, as if they got the answer to some math question
before the other kids.  They have an answer, certainly, but odds
are it's wrong.<br><br>A friend of mine who is a quite successful doctor complains constantly
about her job.  When people applying to medical school ask her for
advice, she wants to shake them and yell "Don't do it!"  (But she
never does.) How did she get into this fix?  In high school she
already wanted to be a doctor.  And she is so ambitious and determined
that she overcame every obstacle along the way — including,
unfortunately, not liking it.<br><br>Now she has a life chosen for her by a high-school kid.<br><br>When you're young, you're given the impression that you'll get
enough information to make each choice before you need to make it.
But this is certainly not so with work.  When you're deciding what
to do, you have to operate on ridiculously incomplete information.
Even in college you get little idea what various types of work are
like.  At best you may have a couple internships, but not all jobs
offer internships, and those that do don't teach you much more about
the work than being a batboy teaches you about playing baseball.<br><br>In the design of lives, as in the design of most other things, you
get better results if you use flexible media.  So unless you're
fairly sure what you want to do, your best bet may be to choose a
type of work that could turn into either an organic or two-job
career.  That was probably part of the reason I chose computers.
You can be a professor, or make a lot of money, or morph it into
any number of other kinds of work.<br><br>It's also wise, early on, to seek jobs that let you do many different
things, so you can learn faster what various kinds of work are like.
Conversely, the extreme version of the two-job route is dangerous
because it teaches you so little about what you like.  If you work
hard at being a bond trader for ten years, thinking that you'll
quit and write novels when you have enough money, what happens when
you quit and then discover that you don't actually like writing
novels?<br><br>Most people would say, I'd take that problem.  Give me a million
dollars and I'll figure out what to do.  But it's harder than it
looks.  Constraints give your life shape.  Remove them and most
people have no idea what to do: look at what happens to those who
win lotteries or inherit money.  Much as everyone thinks they want
financial security, the happiest people are not those who have it,
but those who like what they do.  So a plan that promises freedom
at the expense of knowing what to do with it may not be as good as
it seems.<br><br>Whichever route you take, expect a struggle.  Finding work you love
is very difficult.  Most people fail.  Even if you succeed, it's
rare to be free to work on what you want till your thirties or
forties.  But if you have the destination in sight you'll be more
likely to arrive at it.  If you know you can love work, you're in
the home stretch, and if you know what work you love, you're
practically there.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Currently we do the opposite: when we make kids do boring work,
like arithmetic drills, instead of admitting frankly that it's
boring, we try to disguise it with superficial decorations.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
One father told me about a related phenomenon: he found himself
concealing from his family how much he liked his work.  When he
wanted to go to work on a saturday, he found it easier to say that
it was because he "had to" for some reason, rather than admitting
he preferred to work than stay home with them.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Something similar happens with suburbs.  Parents move to suburbs
to raise their kids in a safe environment, but suburbs are so dull
and artificial that by the time they're fifteen the kids are convinced
the whole world is boring.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
I'm not saying friends should be the only audience for your
work.  The more people you can help, the better.  But friends should
be your compass.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Donald Hall said young would-be poets were mistaken to be so
obsessed with being published.  But you can imagine what it would
do for a 24 year old to get a poem published in <i>The New Yorker</i>.
Now to people he meets at parties he's a real poet.  Actually he's
no better or worse than he was before, but to a clueless audience
like that, the approval of an official authority makes all the
difference.   So it's a harder problem than Hall realizes.  The
reason the young care so much about prestige is that the people
they want to impress are not very discerning.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
This is isomorphic to the principle that you should prevent
your beliefs about how things are from being contaminated by how
you wish they were.  Most people let them mix pretty promiscuously.
The continuing popularity of religion is the most visible index of
that.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
A more accurate metaphor would be to say that the graph of jobs
is not very well connected.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Dan Friedman, Sarah Harlin,

<a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y
Combinator</a>.  Or more precisely, he asked if we'd started YC mainly
for fun.<br><br>Kind of, but not quite.  It is enormously fun to be able to work
with Rtm and Trevor again.  I missed that after we sold Viaweb, and
for all the years after I always had a background process running,
looking for something we could do together.  There is definitely
an aspect of a band reunion to Y Combinator.  Every couple days I
slip and call it "Viaweb."<br><br>Viaweb we started very explicitly to make money.  I was sick of
living from one freelance project to the next, and decided to just
work as hard as I could till I'd made enough to solve the problem
once and for all.  Viaweb was sometimes fun, but it wasn't designed
for fun, and mostly it wasn't.  I'd be surprised if any startup is.
All startups are mostly schleps.<br><br>The real reason we started Y Combinator is neither selfish nor
virtuous.  We didn't start it mainly to make money; we have no idea
what our average returns might be, and won't know for years.  Nor
did we start YC mainly to help out young would-be founders, though
we do like the idea, and comfort ourselves occasionally with the
thought that if all our investments tank, we will thus have been
doing something unselfish.  (It's oddly nondeterministic.)<br><br>The real reason we started Y Combinator is one probably only a
<a href="gba.html">hacker</a> would understand.  We did it because it seems such a great
hack.  There are thousands of smart people who could start companies
and don't, and with a relatively small amount of force applied at
just the right place, we can spring on the world a stream of new
startups that might otherwise not have existed.<br><br>In a way this is virtuous, because I think startups are a good
thing.  But really what motivates us is the completely amoral desire
that would motivate any hacker who looked at some complex device
and realized that with a tiny tweak he could make it run more
efficiently.  In this case, the device is the world's economy, which
fortunately happens to be open source.<br><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><br><br></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

It issued in 2003, but no one told me.  I wouldn't know about it
now except that a few months ago, while visiting Yahoo, I happened
to run into a Big Cheese I knew from working there in the late
nineties.  He brought up something called Revenue Loop, which Viaweb
had been working on when they bought us.<br><br>The idea is basically that you sort search results not in order of
textual "relevance" (as search engines did then) nor in order of
how much advertisers bid (as Overture did) but in order of the bid
times the number of transactions.  Ordinarily you'd do this for
shopping searches, though in fact one of the features of our scheme
is that it automatically detects which searches are shopping searches.<br><br>If you just order the results in order of bids, you can make the
search results useless, because the first results could be dominated
by lame sites that had bid the most.  But if you order results by
bid multiplied by transactions, far from selling out, you're getting
a <i>better</i> measure of relevance.  What could be a better sign that
someone was satisfied with a search result than going to the site
and buying something?<br><br>And, of course, this algorithm automatically maximizes the revenue
of the search engine.<br><br>Everyone is focused on this type of approach now, but few were in
1998.  In 1998 it was all about selling banner ads.  We didn't know
that, so we were pretty excited when we figured out what seemed to
us the optimal way of doing shopping searches.<br><br>When Yahoo was thinking of buying us, we had a meeting with Jerry
Yang in New York.  For him, I now realize, this was supposed to be
one of those meetings when you check out a company you've pretty
much decided to buy, just to make sure they're ok guys.  We weren't
expected to do more than chat and seem smart and reasonable.  He
must have been dismayed when I jumped up to the whiteboard and
launched into a presentation of our exciting new technology.<br><br>I was just as dismayed when he didn't seem to care at all about it.
At the time I thought, "boy, is this guy poker-faced.  We present
to him what has to be the optimal way of sorting product search
results, and he's not even curious."  I didn't realize till much later
why he didn't care.  In 1998, advertisers were overpaying enormously
for ads on web sites.  
In 1998, if advertisers paid the maximum that traffic was worth to
them, Yahoo's revenues would have <i>decreased.</i><br><br>Things are different now, of course.  Now this sort of thing is all
the rage.  So when I ran into the Yahoo exec I knew from the old
days in the Yahoo cafeteria a few months ago, the first thing he
remembered was not (fortunately) all the fights I had with him, but
Revenue Loop.<br><br>"Well," I said, "I think we actually applied for a patent on it.
I'm not sure what happened to the application after I left."<br><br>"Really?  That would be an important patent."<br><br>So someone investigated, and sure enough, that patent application
had continued in the pipeline for several years after, and finally
issued in 2003.<br><br>The main thing that struck me on reading it, actually, is that
lawyers at some point messed up my nice clear writing.  Some clever
person with a spell checker reduced one section to Zen-like incomprehensibility:
<blockquote>
  Also, common spelling errors will tend to get fixed. For example,
  if users searching for "compact disc player" end up spending
  considerable money at sites offering compact disc players, then
  those pages will have a higher relevance for that search phrase,
  even though the phrase "compact disc player" is not present on
  those pages.
</blockquote>
(That "compat disc player" wasn't a typo, guys.)<br><br>For the fine prose of the original, see the provisional application
of February 1998, back when we were still Viaweb and couldn't afford
to pay lawyers to turn every "a lot of" into "considerable."<br><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><br><br></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

March 2006<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at Google.)</i><br><br>A few weeks ago I found to my surprise that I'd been granted four <a href="http://paulgraham.infogami.com/blog/morepatents">patents</a>.  
This was all the more surprising
because I'd only applied for three.  The patents aren't mine, of
course.  They were assigned to Viaweb, and became Yahoo's when they
bought us.  But the news set me thinking about the question of
software patents generally.<br><br>Patents are a hard problem.  I've had to advise most of the startups
we've funded about them, and despite years of experience I'm still
not always sure I'm giving the right advice.<br><br>One thing I do feel pretty certain of is that if you're against
software patents, you're against patents in general.  Gradually our
machines consist more and more of software.  Things that used to
be done with levers and cams and gears are now done with loops and
trees and closures.  There's nothing special about physical embodiments
of control systems that should make them patentable, and the software
equivalent not.<br><br>Unfortunately, patent law is inconsistent on this point.  Patent
law in most countries says that algorithms aren't patentable.  This
rule is left over from a time when "algorithm" meant something like
the Sieve of Eratosthenes.  In 1800, people could not see as readily
as we can that a great many patents on mechanical objects were
really patents on the algorithms they embodied.<br><br>Patent lawyers still have to pretend that's what they're doing when
they patent algorithms.  You must not use the word "algorithm" in
the title of a patent application, just as you must not use the
word "essays" in the title of a book.  If you want to patent an
algorithm, you have to frame it as a computer system executing that algorithm.
Then it's mechanical; phew.  The default euphemism for algorithm
is "system and method."  Try a patent search for that phrase and
see how many results you get.<br><br>Since software patents are no different from hardware patents,
people who say "software patents are evil" are saying simply "patents
are evil."  So why do so many people complain about software patents
specifically?<br><br>I think the problem is more with the patent office than the concept
of software patents.  Whenever software meets government, bad things
happen, because software changes fast and government changes slow.
The patent office has been overwhelmed by both the volume and the
novelty of applications for software patents, and as a result they've
made a lot of mistakes.<br><br>The most common is to grant patents that shouldn't be granted.  To
be patentable, an invention has to be more than new.  It also has
to be non-obvious.  And this, especially, is where the USPTO has
been dropping the ball. Slashdot has an icon that expresses the
problem vividly: a knife and fork with the words "patent pending"
superimposed.<br><br>The scary thing is, this is the <i>only</i> icon they have for
patent stories.  Slashdot readers now take it for granted that a
story about a patent will be about a bogus patent.
That's how bad the problem has become.<br><br>The problem with Amazon's notorious one-click patent, for example,
is not that it's a software patent, but that it's obvious.  Any
online store that kept people's shipping addresses would have
implemented this.  The reason Amazon did it first was not that they
were especially smart, but because they were one of the earliest
sites with enough clout to force customers to log in before they
could buy something. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>We, as hackers, know the USPTO is letting people patent the knives
and forks of our world.  The problem is, the USPTO are not hackers.
They're probably good at judging new inventions for casting steel
or grinding lenses, but they don't understand software yet.<br><br>At this point an optimist would be tempted to add "but they will
eventually."  Unfortunately that might not be true.  The problem
with software patents is an instance of a more general one: the
patent office takes a while to understand new technology.  If so,
this problem will only get worse, because the rate of technological
change seems to be increasing.  In thirty years, the patent office
may understand the sort of things we now patent as software, but
there will be other new types of inventions they understand even
less.<br><br>Applying for a patent is a negotiation.  You generally apply for a
broader patent than you think you'll be granted, and the examiners
reply by throwing out some of your claims and granting others.  So
I don't really blame Amazon for applying for the one-click patent.
The big mistake was the patent office's, for not insisting on
something narrower, with real technical content.  By granting such
an over-broad patent, the USPTO in effect slept with Amazon on the
first date.  Was Amazon supposed to say no?<br><br>Where Amazon went over to the dark side was not in applying for the
patent, but in enforcing it.  A lot of companies (Microsoft, for
example) have been granted large numbers of preposterously over-broad
patents,  but they keep them mainly for defensive purposes.  Like
nuclear weapons, the main role of big companies' patent portfolios
is to threaten anyone who attacks them with a counter-suit.  Amazon's
suit against Barnes &amp; Noble was thus the equivalent of a nuclear
first strike.<br><br>That suit probably hurt Amazon more than it helped them.  Barnes &amp;
Noble was a lame site; Amazon would have crushed them anyway.  To
attack a rival they could have ignored, Amazon put a lasting black
mark on their own reputation.  Even now I think if you asked hackers
to free-associate about Amazon, the one-click patent would turn up
in the first ten topics.<br><br>Google clearly doesn't feel that merely holding patents is evil.
They've applied for a lot of them.  Are they hypocrites?  Are patents
evil?<br><br>There are really two variants of that question, and people answering
it often aren't clear in their own minds which they're answering.
There's a narrow variant: is it bad, given the current legal system,
to apply for patents? and also a broader one: is it bad that the
current legal system allows patents?<br><br>These are separate questions.  For example, in preindustrial societies
like medieval Europe, when someone attacked you, you didn't call
the police.  There were no police.  When attacked, you were supposed
to fight back, and there were conventions about how to do it.  Was
this wrong?  That's two questions: was it wrong to take justice
into your own hands, and was it wrong that you had to?  We tend to
say yes to the second, but no to the first.  If no one else will
defend you, you have to defend yourself.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The situation with patents is similar.  Business is a kind of
ritualized warfare.  Indeed, it evolved from actual warfare: most
early traders switched on the fly from merchants to pirates depending
on how strong you seemed.  In business there are certain rules
describing how companies may and may not compete with one another,
and someone deciding that they're going to play by their own rules
is missing the point.  Saying "I'm not going to apply for patents
just because everyone else does" is not like saying "I'm not going
to lie just because everyone else does."  It's more like saying
"I'm not going to use TCP/IP just because everyone else does." Oh
yes you are.<br><br>A closer comparison might be someone seeing a hockey game for the
first time, realizing with shock that the players were <i>deliberately</i>
bumping into one another, and deciding that one would on no account
be so rude when playing hockey oneself.<br><br>Hockey allows checking.  It's part of the game.  If your team refuses
to do it, you simply lose.  So it is in business.  Under the present
rules, patents are part of the game.<br><br>What does that mean in practice?  We tell the startups we fund not
to worry about infringing patents, because startups rarely get sued
for patent infringement.  There are only two reasons someone might
sue you: for money, or to prevent you from competing with them.
Startups are too poor to be worth suing for money. And in practice
they don't seem to get sued much by competitors, either.  They don't
get sued by other startups because (a) patent suits are an expensive
distraction, and (b) since the other startups are as young as they
are, their patents probably haven't issued yet. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
Nor do startups,
at least in the software business, seem to get sued much by established
competitors.  Despite all the patents Microsoft holds, I don't know
of an instance where they sued a startup for patent infringement.
Companies like Microsoft and Oracle don't win by winning lawsuits.
That's too uncertain.  They win by locking competitors out of their
sales channels.  If you do manage to threaten them, they're more
likely to buy you than sue you.<br><br>When you read of big companies filing patent suits against smaller
ones, it's usually a big company on the way down, grasping at
straws.  For example, Unisys's attempts to enforce their patent on
LZW compression.  When you see a big company threatening patent
suits, sell.  When a company starts fighting over IP, it's a sign
they've lost the real battle, for users.<br><br>A company that sues competitors for patent infringement is like
a defender who has been beaten so thoroughly that he turns to plead
with the referee.  You don't do that if you can still reach the
ball, even if you genuinely believe you've been fouled.  So a company
threatening patent suits is a company in <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/15/azul_sues_sun/">trouble</a>.<br><br>When we were working on Viaweb, a bigger company in the e-commerce
business was granted a patent on online ordering, or something like
that.  I got a call from a VP there asking if we'd like to license
it.  I replied that I thought the patent was completely bogus, and
would never hold up in court.  "Ok," he replied.  "So, are you guys
hiring?"<br><br>If your startup grows big enough, however, you'll start to get sued,
no matter what you do.  If you go public, for example, you'll be
sued by multiple patent trolls who hope you'll pay them off to go
away.  More on them later.<br><br>In other words, no one will sue you for patent infringement till
you have money, and once you have money, people will sue you whether
they have grounds to or not.  So I advise fatalism.  Don't waste
your time worrying about patent infringement.  You're probably
violating a patent every time you tie your shoelaces.  At the start,
at least, just worry about making something great and getting lots
of users.  If you grow to the point where anyone considers you worth
attacking, you're doing well.<br><br>We do advise the companies we fund to apply for patents, but not
so they can sue competitors.  Successful startups either get bought
or grow into big companies.  If a startup wants to grow into a big
company, they should apply for patents to build up the patent
portfolio they'll need to maintain an armed truce with other big
companies.  If they want to get bought, they should apply for patents
because patents are part of the mating dance with acquirers.<br><br>Most startups that succeed do it by getting bought, and most acquirers
care about patents.  Startup acquisitions are usually a build-vs-buy
decision for the acquirer.  Should we buy this little startup or
build our own?  And two things, especially, make them decide not
to build their own: if you already have a large and rapidly growing
user base, and if you have a fairly solid patent application on
critical parts of your software.<br><br>There's a third reason big companies should prefer buying to building:
that if they built their own, they'd screw it up.  But few big
companies are smart enough yet to admit this to themselves.  It's
usually the acquirer's engineers who are asked how hard it would
be for the company to build their own, and they overestimate their
abilities.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
A patent seems to change the balance.  It gives the
acquirer an excuse to admit they couldn't copy what you're doing.
It may also help them to grasp what's special about your technology.<br><br>Frankly, it surprises me how small a role patents play in the
software business.  It's kind of ironic, considering all the dire
things experts say about software patents stifling innovation, but
when one looks closely at the software business, the most striking
thing is how little patents seem to matter.<br><br>In other fields, companies regularly sue competitors for patent
infringement.  For example, the airport baggage scanning business
was for many years a cozy duopoly shared between two companies,
InVision and L-3.  In 2002 a startup called Reveal appeared, with
new technology that let them build scanners a third the size.  They
were sued for patent infringement before they'd even released a
product.<br><br>You rarely hear that kind of story in our world.  The one example
I've found is, embarrassingly enough, Yahoo, which filed a patent
suit against a gaming startup called Xfire in 2005.  Xfire doesn't
seem to be a very big deal, and it's hard to say why Yahoo felt
threatened.  Xfire's VP of engineering had worked at Yahoo on similar
stuff-- in fact, he was listed as an inventor on the patent Yahoo
sued over-- so perhaps there was something personal about it.  My
guess is that someone at Yahoo goofed.  At any rate they didn't
pursue the suit very vigorously.<br><br>Why do patents play so small a role in software?  I can think of
three possible reasons.<br><br>One is that software is so complicated that patents by themselves
are not worth very much.  I may be maligning other fields here, but
it seems that in most types of engineering you can hand the details
of some new technique to a group of medium-high quality people and
get the desired result.  For example, if someone develops a new
process for smelting ore that gets a better yield, and you assemble
a team of qualified experts and tell them about it, they'll be able
to get the same yield.  This doesn't seem to work in software.
Software is so subtle and unpredictable that "qualified experts"
don't get you very far.<br><br>That's why we rarely hear phrases like "qualified expert" in the
software business.  What that level of ability can get you is, say,
to make your software compatible with some other piece of software--
in eight months, at enormous cost.  To do anything harder you need
individual brilliance.  If you assemble a team of qualified experts
and tell them to make a new web-based email program, they'll get
their asses kicked by a team of inspired nineteen year olds.<br><br>Experts can implement, but they can't <a href="taste.html">design</a>.
Or rather, expertise in implementation is the only kind most people,
including the experts themselves, can measure. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>But design is a definite skill.  It's not just an airy intangible.
Things always seem intangible when you don't understand them.
Electricity seemed an airy intangible to most people in 1800.  Who
knew there was so much to know about it?  So it is with design.
Some people are good at it and some people are bad at it, and there's
something very tangible they're good or bad at.<br><br>The reason design counts so much in software is probably that there
are fewer constraints than on physical things.  Building physical
things is expensive and dangerous.  The space of possible choices
is smaller; you tend to have to work as part of a larger group; and
you're subject to a lot of regulations.  You don't have any of that
if you and a couple friends decide to create a new web-based
application.<br><br>Because there's so much scope for design in software, a successful
application tends to be way more than the sum of its patents.  What
protects little companies from being copied by bigger competitors
is not just their patents, but the thousand little things the big
company will get wrong if they try.<br><br>The second reason patents don't count for much in our world is that
startups rarely attack big companies head-on, the way Reveal did.
In the software business, startups beat established companies by
transcending them.  Startups don't build desktop word processing
programs to compete with Microsoft Word. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font>
They build Writely.
If this paradigm is crowded, just wait for the next one; they run
pretty frequently on this route.<br><br>Fortunately for startups, big companies are extremely good at denial.
If you take the trouble to attack them from an oblique angle, they'll
meet you half-way and maneuver to keep you in their blind spot.  To
sue a startup would mean admitting it was dangerous, and that often
means seeing something the big company doesn't want to see.  IBM
used to sue its mainframe competitors regularly, but they didn't
bother much about the microcomputer industry because they didn't
want to see the threat it posed.  Companies building web based apps
are similarly protected from Microsoft, which even now doesn't want
to imagine a world in which Windows is irrelevant.<br><br>The third reason patents don't seem to matter very much in software
is public opinion-- or rather, hacker opinion.  In a recent <a href="http://www.computing.co.uk/forbes/news/2152720/interview-steve-ballmer-linux">interview</a>,
Steve Ballmer coyly left open the possibility of attacking Linux
on patent grounds.  But I doubt Microsoft would ever be so stupid.
They'd face the mother of all boycotts.  And not just from the
technical community in general; a lot of their own people would
rebel.<br><br>Good hackers care a lot about matters of principle, and they are
highly mobile.  If a company starts misbehaving, smart people won't
work there.  For some reason this seems to be more true in software
than other businesses.  I don't think it's because hackers have
intrinsically higher principles so much as that their skills are
easily transferrable.  Perhaps we can split the difference and say
that mobility gives hackers the luxury of being principled.<br><br>Google's "don't be evil" policy may for this reason be the most
valuable thing they've discovered.  It's very constraining in some
ways.  If Google does do something evil, they get doubly whacked
for it: once for whatever they did, and again for hypocrisy.  But
I think it's worth it.  It helps them to hire the best people, and
it's better, even from a purely selfish point of view, to be
constrained by principles than by stupidity.<br><br>(I wish someone would get this point across to the present
administration.)<br><br>I'm not sure what the proportions are of the preceding three
ingredients, but the custom among the big companies seems to be not
to sue the small ones, and the startups are mostly too busy and too
poor to sue one another.  So despite the huge number of software
patents there's not a lot of suing going on.  With one exception:
patent trolls.<br><br>Patent trolls are companies consisting mainly of lawyers whose whole
business is to accumulate patents and threaten to sue companies who
actually make things.  Patent trolls, it seems safe to say, are
evil.  I feel a bit stupid saying that, because when you're saying
something that Richard Stallman and Bill Gates would both agree
with, you must be perilously close to tautologies.<br><br>The CEO of Forgent, one of the most notorious patent trolls, says
that what his company does is "the American way." Actually that's
not true. The American way is to make money by <a href="wealth.html">creating wealth</a>, not by suing people. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font>
What companies like Forgent do is actually the proto-industrial
way.  In the period just before the industrial revolution, some of
the greatest fortunes in countries like England and France were
made by courtiers who extracted some lucrative right from the crown--
like the right to collect taxes on the import of silk-- and then
used this to squeeze money from the merchants in that business.  So
when people compare patent trolls to the mafia, they're more right
than they know, because the mafia too are not merely bad, but bad
specifically in the sense of being an obsolete business model.<br><br>Patent trolls seem to have caught big companies by surprise.  In
the last couple years they've extracted hundreds of millions of
dollars from them.  Patent trolls are hard to fight precisely because
they create nothing.  Big companies are safe from being sued by
other big companies because they can threaten a counter-suit.  But
because patent trolls don't make anything, there's nothing they can
be sued for.  I predict this loophole will get closed fairly quickly,
at least by legal standards.  It's clearly an abuse of the system,
and the victims are powerful.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>But evil as patent trolls are, I don't think they hamper innovation
much.  They don't sue till a startup has made money, and by that
point the innovation that generated it has already happened.  I
can't think of a startup that avoided working on some problem because
of patent trolls.<br><br>So much for hockey as the game is played now.  What about the more
theoretical question of whether hockey would be a better game without
checking?  Do patents encourage or discourage innovation?<br><br>This is a very hard question to answer in the general case.  People
write whole books on the topic.  One of my main hobbies is the
history of technology, and even though I've studied the subject for
years, it would take me several weeks of research to be able to say
whether patents have in general been a net win.<br><br>One thing I can say is that 99.9% of the people who express opinions
on the subject do it not based on such research, but out of a kind
of religious conviction.  At least, that's the polite way of putting
it; the colloquial version involves speech coming out of organs not
designed for that purpose.<br><br>Whether they encourage innovation or not, patents were at least
intended to.  You don't get a patent for nothing.  In return for
the exclusive right to use an idea, you have to <i>publish</i> it,
and it was largely to encourage such openness that patents were
established.<br><br>Before patents, people protected ideas by keeping them secret.  With
patents, central governments said, in effect, if you tell everyone
your idea, we'll protect it for you.  There is a parallel here to
the rise of civil order, which happened at roughly the same time.
Before central governments were powerful enough to enforce order,
rich people had private armies.  As governments got more powerful,
they gradually compelled magnates to cede most responsibility for
protecting them.  (Magnates still have bodyguards, but no longer
to protect them from other magnates.)<br><br>Patents, like police, are involved in many abuses.  But in both
cases the default is something worse. The choice is not "patents
or freedom?" any more than it is "police or freedom?" The actual
questions are respectively "patents or secrecy?" and "police or
gangs?"<br><br>As with gangs, we have some idea what secrecy would be like, because
that's how things used to be.  The economy of medieval Europe was
divided up into little tribes, each jealously guarding their
privileges and secrets.  In Shakespeare's time, "mystery" was
synonymous with "craft."   Even today we can see an echo of the
secrecy of medieval guilds, in the now pointless secrecy of the
Masons.<br><br>The most memorable example of medieval industrial secrecy is probably
Venice, which forbade glassblowers to leave the city, and sent
assassins after those who tried.  We might like to think we wouldn't
go so far, but the movie industry has already tried to pass <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1026_3-5106684.html">laws</a>
prescribing three year prison terms just for putting movies on
public networks.  Want to try a frightening thought experiment? If
the movie industry could have any law they wanted, where would they
stop?  Short of the death penalty, one assumes, but how close would
they get?<br><br>Even worse than the spectacular abuses might be the overall decrease
in efficiency that would accompany increased secrecy.  As anyone
who has dealt with organizations that operate on a "need to know"
basis can attest, dividing information up into little cells is
terribly inefficient.  The flaw in the "need to know" principle is
that you don't <i>know</i> who needs to know something.  An idea
from one area might spark a great discovery in another.  But the
discoverer doesn't know he needs to know it.<br><br>If secrecy were the only protection for ideas, companies wouldn't
just have to be secretive with other companies; they'd have to be
secretive internally.  This would encourage what is already the
worst trait of big companies.<br><br>I'm not saying secrecy would be worse than patents, just that we
couldn't discard patents for free.  Businesses would become more
secretive to compensate, and in some fields this might get ugly.
Nor am I defending the current patent system.  There is clearly a
lot that's broken about it.   But the breakage seems to affect
software less than most other fields.<br><br>In the software business I know from experience whether patents
encourage or discourage innovation, and the answer is the type that
people who like to argue about public policy least like to hear:
they don't affect innovation much, one way or the other.  Most
innovation in the software business happens in startups, and startups
should simply ignore other companies' patents.  At least, that's
what we advise, and we bet money on that advice.<br><br>The only real role of patents, for most startups, is as an element
of the mating dance with acquirers.  There patents do help a little.
And so they do encourage innovation indirectly, in that they give
more power to startups, which is where, pound for pound, the most
innovation happens.  But even in the mating dance, patents are of
secondary importance.  It matters more to make something great and
get a lot of users.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
You have to be careful here, because a great discovery often
seems obvious in retrospect.  One-click ordering, however, is not
such a discovery.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
"Turn the other cheek" skirts the issue; the critical question
is not how to deal with slaps, but sword thrusts.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Applying for a patent is now very slow, but it might actually
be bad if that got fixed.  At the moment the time it takes to get
a patent is conveniently just longer than the time it takes a startup
to succeed or fail.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Instead of the canonical "could you build this?" maybe the corp
dev guys should be asking "will you build this?" or even "why haven't
you already built this?"<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Design ability is so hard to measure that you can't even trust
the design world's internal standards.  You can't assume that someone
with a degree in design is any good at design, or that an eminent
designer is any better than his peers.  If that worked, any company
could build products as good as Apple's just by hiring 
sufficiently qualified designers.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
If anyone wanted to try, we'd be interested to hear from them.
I suspect it's one of those things that's not as hard as everyone
assumes.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Patent trolls can't even claim, like speculators, that they
"create" liquidity.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
If big companies don't want to wait for the government to take
action, there is a way to fight back themselves.  For a long time
I thought there wasn't, because there was nothing to grab onto.
But there is one resource patent trolls need: lawyers.  Big technology
companies between them generate a lot of legal business.  If they
agreed among themselves never to do business with any firm employing
anyone who had worked for a patent troll, either as an employee or
as outside counsel, they could probably starve the trolls of the
lawyers they need.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Dan Bloomberg, Paul Buchheit, Sarah Harlin,

living."  Part of what he meant was that the proper role of humans is to
think, just as the proper role of anteaters is to poke their noses
into anthills.<br><br>A lot of ancient philosophy had the quality — and I
don't mean this in an insulting way — of the kind of conversations
freshmen have late at night in common rooms:
<blockquote>
What is our purpose?  Well, we humans are
as conspicuously different from other animals as the anteater.
In our case the distinguishing feature is the ability to reason.
So obviously that is what we should be doing, and a human who
doesn't is doing a bad job of being human — is no better than an
animal.
</blockquote>
Now we'd give a different answer.  At least, someone Socrates's age
would.  We'd ask why we even suppose we have a "purpose" in life.
We may be better adapted for some things than others; we
may be happier doing things we're adapted for; but why assume
purpose?<br><br>The history of ideas
is a history of gradually discarding the assumption that it's all
about us.  No, it turns out, the earth is not the center of the
universe — not even the center of the solar system.  No, it turns
out, humans are not created by God in his own image; they're just
one species among many, descended not merely from apes, but from
microorganisms.  Even the concept of "me" turns out to be fuzzy
around the edges if you examine it closely.<br><br>The idea that we're the center of things is difficult to discard.
So difficult that there's probably room to discard more.  Richard
Dawkins made another step in that direction only in the last several
decades, with the idea of the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene">selfish gene</a>.   
No, it turns
out, we're not even the protagonists: we're just the latest model
vehicle our genes have constructed to travel around in.  And having
kids is our genes heading for the lifeboats.  Reading
that book snapped my brain out of its previous way of thinking the
way Darwin's must have when it first appeared.<br><br>(Few people can experience now what Darwin's contemporaries did
when <i>The Origin of Species</i> was first published, because everyone
now is raised either to take evolution for granted, or to regard
it as a heresy. No one encounters the idea of natural selection for
the first time as an adult.)<br><br>So if you want to discover things that have been overlooked till
now, one really good place to look is in our blind spot: in our
natural, naive belief that it's all about us.  And expect to encounter
ferocious opposition if you do.<br><br>Conversely, if you have to choose between two theories, prefer the
one that doesn't center on you.<br><br>This principle isn't only for big ideas.  It works in everyday life,
too.  For example, suppose you're saving a piece of cake in the fridge, and you
come home one day to find your housemate has eaten
it.  Two possible theories:
<blockquote>
a) Your housemate did it deliberately to upset you.  He <i>knew</i>
you were saving that piece of cake.<br><br>b) Your housemate was hungry.
</blockquote>
I say pick b.  No one knows who said "never attribute to malice what
can be explained by incompetence," but it is a powerful idea.
Its more general version is our answer to the Greeks:

<a href="http://startupschool.org">Startup School</a>.)</i><br><br>The startups we've funded so far are pretty quick, but they seem
quicker to learn some lessons than others.  I think it's because
some things about startups are kind of counterintuitive.<br><br>We've now 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com">invested</a> 
in enough companies that I've learned a trick
for determining which points are the counterintuitive ones:
they're the ones I have to keep repeating.<br><br>So I'm going to number these points, and maybe with future startups
I'll be able to pull off a form of Huffman coding. I'll make them
all read this, and then instead of nagging them in detail, I'll
just be able to say: <i>number four!</i><br><br>
<b>1. Release Early.</b><br><br>The thing I probably repeat most is this recipe for a startup: get
a version 1 out fast, then improve it based on users' reactions.<br><br>By "release early" I don't mean you should release something full
of bugs, but that you should release something minimal.  Users hate
bugs, but they don't seem to mind a minimal version 1, if there's
more coming soon.<br><br>There are several reasons it pays to get version 1 done fast.  One
is that this is simply the right way to write software, whether for
a startup or not.  I've been repeating that since 1993, and I haven't seen much since to
contradict it.  I've seen a lot of startups die because they were
too slow to release stuff, and none because they were too quick.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>One of the things that will surprise you if you build something
popular is that you won't know your users.  <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> now has almost half a million
unique visitors a month.  Who are all those people?  They have no
idea.  No web startup does.  And since you don't know your users,
it's dangerous to guess what they'll like.  Better to release
something and let them tell you.<br><br><a href="http://wufoo.com">Wufoo</a> took this to heart and released
their form-builder before the underlying database.  You can't even
drive the thing yet, but 83,000 people came to sit in the driver's
seat and hold the steering wheel.  And Wufoo got valuable feedback
from it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so they
rewrote their software not to.  If they'd waited to release everything
at once, they wouldn't have discovered this problem till it was
more deeply wired in.<br><br>Even if you had no users, it would still be important to release
quickly, because for a startup the initial release acts as a shakedown
cruise.  If anything major is broken-- if the idea's no good,
for example, or the founders hate one another-- the stress of getting
that first version out will expose it.  And if you have such problems
you want to find them early.<br><br>Perhaps the most important reason to release early, though, is that
it makes you work harder.  When you're working on something that
isn't released, problems are intriguing.  In something that's out
there, problems are alarming.  There is a lot more urgency once you
release.  And I think that's precisely why people put it off.  They
know they'll have to work a lot harder once they do. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>2. Keep Pumping Out Features.</b><br><br>Of course, "release early" has a second component, without which
it would be bad advice.  If you're going to start with something
that doesn't do much, you better improve it fast.<br><br>What I find myself repeating is "pump out features."  And this rule
isn't just for the initial stages.  This is something all startups
should do for as long as they want to be considered startups.<br><br>I don't mean, of course, that you should make your application ever
more complex.  By "feature" I mean one unit of hacking-- one quantum
of making users' lives better.<br><br>As with exercise, improvements beget improvements.  If you run every
day, you'll probably feel like running tomorrow.  But if you skip
running for a couple weeks, it will be an effort to drag yourself
out.  So it is with hacking: the more ideas you implement, the more
ideas you'll have.  You should make your system better at least in
some small way every day or two.<br><br>This is not just a good way to get development done; it is also a
form of marketing.  Users love a site that's constantly improving.
In fact, users expect a site to improve.  Imagine if you visited a
site that seemed very good, and then returned two months later and
not one thing had changed.  Wouldn't it start to seem lame? 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>They'll like you even better when you improve in response to their
comments, because customers are used to companies ignoring them.
If you're the rare exception-- a company that actually listens--
you'll generate fanatical loyalty.  You won't need to advertise,
because your users will do it for you.<br><br>This seems obvious too, so why do I have to keep repeating it?  I
think the problem here is that people get used to how things are.
Once a product gets past the stage where it has glaring flaws, you
start to get used to it, and gradually whatever features it happens
to have become its identity.  For example, I doubt many people at
Yahoo (or Google for that matter) realized how much better web mail
could be till Paul Buchheit showed them.<br><br>I think the solution is to assume that anything you've made is far
short of what it could be.  Force yourself, as a sort of intellectual
exercise, to keep thinking of improvements.  Ok, sure, what you
have is perfect.  But if you had to change something, what would
it be?<br><br>If your product seems finished, there are two possible explanations:
(a) it is finished, or (b) you lack imagination.  Experience suggests
(b) is a thousand times more likely.<br><br>
<b>3. Make Users Happy.</b><br><br>Improving constantly is an instance of a more general rule: make
users happy.  One thing all startups have in common is that they
can't force anyone to do anything.  They can't force anyone to use
their software, and they can't force anyone to do deals with them.
A startup has to sing for its supper.  That's why the successful
ones make great things.  They have to, or die.<br><br>When you're running a startup you feel like a little bit of debris
blown about by powerful winds.  The most powerful wind is users.
They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky, as they did
with Google, or leave you flat on the pavement, as they do with
most startups.  Users are a fickle wind, but more powerful than any
other.  If they take you up, no competitor can keep you down.<br><br>As a little piece of debris, the rational thing for you to do is
not to lie flat, but to curl yourself into a shape the wind will
catch.<br><br>I like the wind metaphor because it reminds you how impersonal the
stream of traffic is.  The vast majority of people who visit your
site will be casual visitors.  It's them you have to design your
site for.  The people who really care will find what they want by
themselves.<br><br>The median visitor will arrive with their finger poised on the Back
button.  Think about your own experience: most links you
follow lead to something lame.  Anyone who has used the web for
more than a couple weeks has been <i>trained</i> to click on Back after
following a link.  So your site has to say "Wait!  Don't click on
Back.  This site isn't lame.  Look at this, for example."<br><br>There are two things you have to do to make people pause.  The most
important is to explain, as concisely as possible, what the hell
your site is about.  How often have you visited a site that seemed
to assume you already knew what they did?  For example, the corporate
<xa href="http://www.interwoven.com/company/">site that says the
company makes
<blockquote>
  enterprise content management solutions for business that enable
  organizations to unify people, content and processes to minimize
  business risk, accelerate time-to-value and sustain lower total
  cost of ownership.
</blockquote>
An established company may get away with such an opaque description,
but no startup can.  A startup
should be able to explain in one or two sentences exactly what it
does. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
And not just to users.  You need this for everyone:
investors, acquirers, partners, reporters, potential employees, and
even current employees.  You probably shouldn't even start a company
to do something that can't be described compellingly in one or two
sentences.<br><br>The other thing I repeat is to give people everything you've got,
right away.  If you have something impressive, try to put it on the
front page, because that's the only one most visitors will see.
Though indeed there's a paradox here: the more you push the good
stuff toward the front, the more likely visitors are to explore
further. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>In the best case these two suggestions get combined: you tell
visitors what your site is about by <i>showing</i> them.  One of the
standard pieces of advice in fiction writing is "show, don't tell."
Don't say that a character's angry; have him grind his teeth, or
break his pencil in half.  Nothing will explain what your site does
so well as using it.<br><br>The industry term here is "conversion."  The job of your site is
to convert casual visitors into users-- whatever your definition
of a user is.  You can measure this in your growth rate.  Either
your site is catching on, or it isn't, and you must know which.  If
you have decent growth, you'll win in the end, no matter how obscure
you are now.  And if you don't, you need to fix something.<br><br>
<b>4. Fear the Right Things.</b><br><br>Another thing I find myself saying a lot is "don't worry."  Actually,
it's more often "don't worry about this; worry about that instead."
Startups are right to be paranoid, but they sometimes fear the wrong
things.<br><br>Most visible disasters are not so alarming as they seem.  Disasters
are normal in a startup: a founder quits, you discover a patent
that covers what you're doing, your servers keep crashing, you run
into an insoluble technical problem, you have to change your name,
a deal falls through-- these are all par for the course.  They won't
kill you unless you let them.<br><br>Nor will most competitors.  A lot of startups worry "what if Google
builds something like us?"  Actually big companies are not the ones
you have to worry about-- not even Google.  The people at Google
are smart, but no smarter than you; they're not as motivated, because
Google is not going to go out of business if this one product fails;
and even at Google they have a lot of bureaucracy to slow them down.<br><br>What you should fear, as a startup, is not the established players,
but other startups you don't know exist yet.  They're way more
dangerous than Google because, like you, they're cornered animals.<br><br>Looking just at existing competitors can give you a false sense of
security.  You should compete against what someone else <i>could</i> be
doing, not just what you can see people doing.  A corollary is that
you shouldn't relax just because you have no visible competitors
yet.  No matter what your idea, there's someone else out there
working on the same thing.<br><br>That's the downside of it being easier to start a startup: more people
are doing it.  But I disagree with Caterina Fake when she says that
makes this a bad time to start a startup.  More people are starting
startups, but not as many more as could.  Most college graduates
still think they have to get a job.  The average person can't ignore
something that's been beaten into their head since they were three
just because serving web pages recently got a lot cheaper.<br><br>And in any case, competitors are not the biggest threat.  Way more
startups hose themselves than get crushed by competitors.  There
are a lot of ways to do it, but the three main ones are internal
disputes, inertia, and ignoring users.  Each is, by itself, enough
to kill you.  But if I had to pick the worst, it would be ignoring
users.  If you want a recipe for a startup that's going to die,
here it is: a couple of founders who have some great idea they know
everyone is going to love, and that's what they're going to build,
no matter what.<br><br>Almost everyone's initial plan is broken.  If companies stuck to
their initial plans, Microsoft would be selling programming languages,
and Apple would be selling printed circuit boards.  In both cases
their customers told them what their business should be-- and they
were smart enough to listen.<br><br>As Richard Feynman said, the imagination of nature is greater than
the imagination of man.  You'll find more interesting things by
looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking.
This principle is very powerful.  It's why the best abstract painting
still falls short of Leonardo, for example.  And it applies to
startups too.  No idea for a product could ever be so clever as the
ones you can discover by smashing a beam of prototypes into a beam
of users.<br><br>
<b>5. Commitment Is a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.</b><br><br>I now have enough experience with startups to be able to say what
the most important quality is in a startup founder, and it's not
what you might think.  The most important quality in a startup
founder is determination.  Not intelligence-- determination.<br><br>This is a little depressing.  I'd like to believe Viaweb succeeded
because we were smart, not merely determined.  A lot of people in
the startup world want to believe that.  Not just founders, but
investors too.  They like the idea of inhabiting a world ruled by
intelligence.  And you can tell they really believe this, because
it affects their investment decisions.<br><br>Time after time VCs invest in startups founded by eminent professors.
This may work in biotech, where a lot of startups simply commercialize
existing research, but in software you want to invest in students,
not professors.  Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google were all founded by
people who dropped out of school to do it.  What students lack in
experience they more than make up in dedication.<br><br>Of course, if you want to get rich, it's not enough merely to be
determined.  You have to be smart too, right?  I'd like to think
so, but I've had an experience that convinced me otherwise: I spent
several years living in New York.<br><br>You can lose quite a lot in the brains department and it won't kill
you.  But lose even a little bit in the commitment department, and
that will kill you very rapidly.<br><br>Running a startup is like walking on your hands: it's possible, but
it requires extraordinary effort.  If an ordinary employee were
asked to do the things a startup founder has to, he'd be very
indignant.  Imagine if you were hired at some big company, and in
addition to writing software ten times faster than you'd ever had
to before, they expected you to answer support calls, administer
the servers, design the web site, cold-call customers, find the
company office space, and go out and get everyone lunch.<br><br>And to do all this not in the calm, womb-like atmosphere of a big
company, but against a backdrop of constant disasters.  That's the
part that really demands determination.  In a startup, there's
always some disaster happening.  So if you're the least bit inclined
to find an excuse to quit, there's always one right there.<br><br>But if you lack commitment, chances are it will have been hurting
you long before you actually quit.  Everyone who deals with startups
knows how important commitment is, so if they sense you're ambivalent,
they won't give you much attention.  If you lack commitment, you'll
just find that for some mysterious reason good things happen to
your competitors but not to you.  If you lack commitment, it will
seem to you that you're unlucky.<br><br>Whereas if you're determined to stick around, people will pay
attention to you, because odds are they'll have to deal with you
later.  You're a local, not just a tourist, so everyone has to come
to terms with you.<br><br>At Y Combinator we sometimes mistakenly fund teams who have the
attitude that they're going to give this startup thing a shot for
three months, and if something great happens, they'll stick with
it-- "something great" meaning either that someone wants to buy
them or invest millions of dollars in them.  But if this is your
attitude, "something great" is very unlikely to happen to you,
because both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of
commitment.<br><br>If an acquirer thinks you're going to stick around no matter what,
they'll be more likely to buy you, because if they don't and you
stick around, you'll probably grow, your price will go up, and
they'll be left wishing they'd bought you earlier.  Ditto for
investors.  What really motivates investors, even big VCs, is not
the hope of good returns, but the fear of missing out. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font>
So if
you make it clear you're going to succeed no matter what, and the only
reason you need them is to make it happen a little faster, you're
much more likely to get money.<br><br>You can't fake this.  The only way to convince everyone that you're
ready to fight to the death is actually to be ready to.<br><br>You have to be the right kind of determined, though.  I carefully
chose the word determined rather than stubborn, because stubbornness
is a disastrous quality in a startup.  You have to be determined,
but flexible, like a running back.  A successful running back doesn't
just put his head down and try to run through people.  He improvises:
if someone appears in front of him, he runs around them; if someone
tries to grab him, he spins out of their grip; he'll even run in
the wrong direction briefly if that will help.  The one thing he'll
never do is stand still. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>6. There Is Always Room.</b><br><br>I was talking recently to a startup founder about whether it might
be good to add a social component to their software.  He said he
didn't think so, because the whole social thing was tapped out.
Really?  So in a hundred years the only social networking sites
will be the Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, and Del.icio.us?  Not likely.<br><br>There is always room for new stuff.  At every point in history,
even the darkest bits of the dark ages, people were discovering
things that made everyone say "why didn't anyone think of that
before?"  We know this continued to be true up till 2004, when the
Facebook was founded-- though strictly speaking someone else did
think of that.<br><br>The reason we don't see the opportunities all around us is that we
adjust to however things are, and assume that's how things have to
be.  For example, it would seem crazy to most people to try to make
a better search engine than Google.  Surely that field, at least,
is tapped out.  Really?  In a hundred years-- or even twenty-- are
people still going to search for information using something like
the current Google?  Even Google probably doesn't think that.<br><br>In particular, I don't think there's any limit to the number of
startups.  Sometimes you hear people saying "All these guys starting
startups now are going to be disappointed. How many little startups
are Google and Yahoo going to buy, after all?" That sounds cleverly
skeptical, but I can prove it's mistaken.  No one proposes that
there's some limit to the number of people who can be employed in
an economy consisting of big, slow-moving companies with a couple
thousand people each.  Why should there be any limit to the number
who could be employed by small, fast-moving companies with ten each?
It seems to me the only limit would be the number of people who
want to work that hard.<br><br>The limit on the number of startups is not the number that can get
acquired by Google and Yahoo-- though it seems even that should
be unlimited, if the startups were actually worth buying-- but the
amount of wealth that can be created.  And I don't think there's
any limit on that, except cosmological ones.<br><br>So for all practical purposes, there is no limit to the number of
startups.  Startups make wealth, which means they make things people
want, and if there's a limit on the number of things people want,
we are nowhere near it.  I still don't even have a flying car.<br><br>
<b>7. Don't Get Your Hopes Up.</b><br><br>This is another one I've been repeating since long before Y Combinator.
It was practically the corporate motto at Viaweb.<br><br>Startup founders are naturally optimistic.  They wouldn't do it
otherwise.  But you should treat your optimism the way you'd treat
the core of a nuclear reactor: as a source of power that's also
very dangerous.  You have to build a shield around it, or it will
fry you.<br><br>The shielding of a reactor is not uniform; the reactor would be
useless if it were.  It's pierced in a few places to let pipes in.
An optimism shield has to be pierced too.  I think the place to
draw the line is between what you expect of yourself, and what you
expect of other people.  It's ok to be optimistic about what you
can do, but assume the worst about machines and other people.<br><br>This is particularly necessary in a startup, because you tend to
be pushing the limits of whatever you're doing.  So things don't
happen in the smooth, predictable way they do in the rest of the
world.  Things change suddenly, and usually for the worse.<br><br>Shielding your optimism is nowhere more important than with deals.
If your startup is doing a deal, just assume it's not going to
happen.  The VCs who say they're going to invest in you aren't.
The company that says they're going to buy you isn't.  The big
customer who wants to use your system in their whole company won't.
Then if things work out you can be pleasantly surprised.<br><br>The reason I warn startups not to get their hopes up is not to save
them from being <i>disappointed</i> when things fall through.  It's
for a more practical reason: to prevent them from leaning their
company against something that's going to fall over, taking them
with it.<br><br>For example, if someone says they want to invest in you, there's a
natural tendency to stop looking for other investors.  That's why
people proposing deals seem so positive: they <i>want</i> you to
stop looking.  And you want to stop too, because doing deals is a
pain.  Raising money, in particular, is a huge time sink.  So you
have to consciously force yourself to keep looking.<br><br>Even if you ultimately do the first deal, it will be to your advantage
to have kept looking, because you'll get better terms.  Deals are
dynamic; unless you're negotiating with someone unusually honest,
there's not a single point where you shake hands and the deal's
done. There are usually a lot of subsidiary questions to be cleared
up after the handshake, and if the other side senses weakness-- if
they sense you need this deal-- they will be very tempted to screw
you in the details.<br><br>VCs and corp dev guys are professional negotiators.  They're trained
to take advantage of weakness. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font>
So while they're often nice
guys, they just can't help it.  And as pros they do this more than
you.  So don't even try to bluff them.  The only way a startup can
have any leverage in a deal is genuinely not to need it.  And if
you don't believe in a deal, you'll be less likely to depend on it.<br><br>So I want to plant a hypnotic suggestion in your heads: when you
hear someone say the words "we want to invest in you" or "we want
to acquire you," I want the following phrase to appear automatically
in your head: <i>don't get your hopes up.</i>  Just continue running
your company as if this deal didn't exist.  Nothing is more likely
to make it close.<br><br>The way to succeed in a startup is to focus on the goal of getting
lots of users, and keep walking swiftly toward it while investors
and acquirers scurry alongside trying to wave money in your face.<br><br>
<b>Speed, not Money</b><br><br>The way I've described it, starting a startup sounds pretty stressful.
It is.  When I talk to the founders of the companies we've funded,
they all say the same thing: I knew it would be hard, but I didn't
realize it would be this hard.<br><br>So why do it?  It would be worth enduring a lot of pain and stress
to do something grand or heroic, but just to make money?  Is making
money really that important?<br><br>No, not really.  It seems ridiculous to me when people take business
too seriously.  I regard making money as a boring errand to be got
out of the way as soon as possible.  There is nothing grand or
heroic about starting a startup per se.<br><br>So why do I spend so much time thinking about startups?  I'll tell
you why.  Economically, a startup is best seen not as a way to get
rich, but as a way to work faster.  You have to make a living, and
a startup is a way to get that done quickly, instead of letting it
drag on through your whole life.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>We take it for granted most of the time, but human life is fairly
miraculous.  It is also palpably short.  You're given this marvellous
thing, and then poof, it's taken away.  You can see why people
invent gods to explain it.  But even to people who don't believe
in gods, life commands respect.  There are times in most of our
lives when the days go by in a blur, and almost everyone has a
sense, when this happens, of wasting something precious.  As Ben
Franklin said, if you love life, don't waste time, because time is
what life is made of.<br><br>So no, there's nothing particularly grand about making money.  That's
not what makes startups worth the trouble.  What's important about
startups is the speed.  By compressing the dull but necessary task
of making a living into the smallest possible time, you show respect
for life, and there is something grand about that.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Startups can die from releasing something full of bugs, and not
fixing them fast enough, but I don't know of any that died from
releasing something stable but minimal very early, then promptly
improving it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
I know this is why I haven't released Arc.  The moment I do,
I'll have people nagging me for features.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
A web site is different from a book or movie or desktop application
in this respect.  Users judge a site not as a single snapshot, but
as an animation with multiple frames.  Of the two, I'd say the rate of
improvement is more important to users than where you currently
are.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
It should not always tell this to users, however.  For example,
MySpace is basically a replacement mall for mallrats.  But it was
wiser for them, initially, to pretend that the site was about bands.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Similarly, don't make users register to try your site.  Maybe
what you have is so valuable that visitors should gladly register
to get at it.  But they've been trained to expect the opposite.
Most of the things they've tried on the web have sucked-- and
probably especially those that made them register.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
VCs have rational reasons for behaving this way. They don't
make their money (if they make money) off their median investments.
In a typical fund, half the companies fail, most of the rest generate
mediocre returns, and one or two "make the fund" by succeeding
spectacularly.  So if they miss just a few of the most promising
opportunities, it could hose the whole fund.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
The attitude of a running back doesn't translate to soccer.
Though it looks great when a forward dribbles past multiple defenders,
a player who persists in trying such things will do worse in the
long term than one who passes.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
The reason Y Combinator never negotiates valuations
is that we're not professional negotiators, and don't want to turn
into them.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
There are two ways to do 
<a href="love.html">work you love</a>: (a) to make money, then work
on what you love, or (b) to get a job where you get paid to work on
stuff you love.  In practice the first phases of both
consist mostly of unedifying schleps, and in (b) the second phase is less
secure.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Beau Hartshorne, Jessica

unique about it?<br><br>It wouldn't be surprising if it were hard to reproduce in other
countries, because you couldn't reproduce it in most of the US
either.  What does it take to make a silicon valley even here?<br><br>What it takes is the right people.  If you could get the right ten
thousand people to move from Silicon Valley to Buffalo, Buffalo
would become Silicon Valley.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>That's a striking departure from the past.  Up till a couple decades
ago, geography was destiny for cities.  All great cities were located
on waterways, because cities made money by trade, and water was the
only economical way to ship.<br><br>Now you could make a great city anywhere, if you could get the right
people to move there.  So the question of how to make a silicon
valley becomes: who are the right people, and how do you get them
to move?<br><br><b>Two Types</b><br><br>I think you only need two kinds of people to create a technology
hub: rich people and nerds.  They're the limiting reagents in the
reaction that produces startups, because they're the only ones
present when startups get started.  Everyone else will move.<br><br>Observation bears this out: within the US, towns have become startup
hubs if and only if they have both rich people and nerds.  Few
startups happen in Miami, for example, because although it's full
of rich people, it has few nerds.  It's not the kind of place nerds
like.<br><br>Whereas Pittsburgh has the opposite problem: plenty of nerds, but
no rich people.  The top US Computer Science departments are said
to be MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, and Carnegie-Mellon.  MIT yielded
Route 128.  Stanford and Berkeley yielded Silicon Valley.  But
Carnegie-Mellon?  The record skips at that point.  Lower down the
list, the University of Washington yielded a high-tech community
in Seattle, and the University of Texas at Austin yielded one in
Austin.  But what happened in Pittsburgh?  And in Ithaca, home of
Cornell, which is also high on the list?<br><br>I grew up in Pittsburgh and went to college at Cornell, so I can
answer for both.  The weather is terrible,  particularly in winter,
and there's no interesting old city to make up for it, as there is
in Boston.  Rich people don't want to live in Pittsburgh or Ithaca.
So while there are plenty of hackers who could start startups,
there's no one to invest in them.<br><br><b>Not Bureaucrats</b><br><br>Do you really need the rich people?  Wouldn't it work to have the
government invest in the nerds?  No, it would not.  Startup investors
are a distinct type of rich people.  They tend to have a lot of
experience themselves in the technology business.  This (a) helps
them pick the right startups, and (b) means they can supply advice
and connections as well as money.  And the fact that they have a
personal stake in the outcome makes them really pay attention.<br><br>Bureaucrats by their nature are the exact opposite sort of people
from startup investors. The idea of them making startup investments
is comic.  It would be like mathematicians running <i>Vogue</i>-- or
perhaps more accurately, <i>Vogue</i> editors running a math journal.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Though indeed, most things bureaucrats do, they do badly.   We just
don't notice usually, because they only have to compete against
other bureaucrats.  But as startup investors they'd have to compete
against pros with a great deal more experience and motivation.<br><br>Even corporations that have in-house VC groups generally forbid
them to make their own investment decisions.  Most are only allowed
to invest in deals where some reputable private VC firm is willing
to act as lead investor.<br><br><b>Not Buildings</b><br><br>If you go to see Silicon Valley, what you'll see are buildings.
But it's the people that make it Silicon Valley, not the buildings.
I read occasionally about attempts to set up "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=technology+park">technology
parks</a>" in other places, as if the active ingredient of Silicon
Valley were the office space.  An article about Sophia Antipolis
bragged that companies there included Cisco, Compaq, IBM, NCR, and
Nortel.  Don't the French realize these aren't startups?<br><br>Building office buildings for technology companies won't get you a
silicon valley, because the key stage in the life of a startup
happens before they want that kind of space.  The key stage is when
they're three guys operating out of an apartment.  Wherever the
startup is when it gets funded, it will stay.  The defining quality
of Silicon Valley is not that Intel or Apple or Google have offices
there, but that they were <i>started</i> there.<br><br>So if you want to reproduce Silicon Valley, what you need to reproduce
is those two or three founders sitting around a kitchen table
deciding to start a company.  And to reproduce that you need those
people.<br><br><b>Universities</b><br><br>The exciting thing is, <i>all</i> you need are the people.  If you could
attract a critical mass of nerds and investors to live somewhere,
you could reproduce Silicon Valley.  And both groups are highly
mobile.  They'll go where life is good.  So what makes a place good
to them?<br><br>What nerds like is other nerds.  Smart people will go wherever other
smart people are.  And in particular, to great universities.  In
theory there could be other ways to attract them, but so far
universities seem to be indispensable.  Within the US, there are
no technology hubs without first-rate universities-- or at least,
first-rate computer science departments.<br><br>So if you want to make a silicon valley, you not only need a
university, but one of the top handful in the world.  It has to be
good enough to act as a magnet, drawing the best people from thousands
of miles away.  And that means it has to stand up to existing magnets
like MIT and Stanford.<br><br>This sounds hard.  Actually it might be easy.  My professor friends,
when they're deciding where they'd like to work, consider one thing
above all: the quality of the other faculty.  What attracts professors
is good colleagues.  So if you managed to recruit, en masse, a
significant number of the best young researchers, you could create
a first-rate university from nothing overnight.  And you could do
that for surprisingly little.  If you paid 200 people hiring bonuses
of $3 million apiece, you could put together a faculty that would
bear comparison with any in the world.  And from that point the
chain reaction would be self-sustaining.  So whatever it costs to
establish a mediocre university, for an additional half billion or
so you could have a great one.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Personality</b><br><br>However, merely creating a new university would not be enough to
start a silicon valley. The university is just the seed.  It has
to be planted in the right soil, or it won't germinate.  Plant it
in the wrong place, and you just create Carnegie-Mellon.<br><br>To spawn startups, your university has to be in a town that has
attractions other than the university.  It has to be a place where
investors want to live, and students want to stay after they graduate.<br><br>The two like much the same things, because most startup investors
are nerds themselves.  So what do nerds look for in a town?  Their
tastes aren't completely different from other people's, because a
lot of the towns they like most in the US are also big tourist
destinations: San Francisco, Boston, Seattle.   But their tastes
can't be quite mainstream either, because they dislike other big
tourist destinations, like New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.<br><br>There has been a lot written lately about the "creative class." The
thesis seems to be that as wealth derives increasingly from ideas,
cities will prosper only if they attract those who have them.  That
is certainly true; in fact it was the basis of Amsterdam's prosperity
400 years ago.<br><br>A lot of nerd tastes they share with the creative class in general.
For example, they like well-preserved old neighborhoods instead of
cookie-cutter suburbs, and locally-owned shops and restaurants
instead of national chains.  Like the rest of the creative class,
they want to live somewhere with personality.<br><br>What exactly is personality?  I think it's the feeling that each
building is the work of a distinct group of people.  A town with
personality is one that doesn't feel mass-produced.  So if you want
to make a startup hub-- or any town to attract the "creative class"--
you probably have to ban large development projects.
When a large tract has been developed by a single organization, you
can always tell. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Most towns with personality are old, but they don't have to be.
Old towns have two advantages: they're denser, because they were
laid out before cars, and they're more varied, because they were
built one building at a time.  You could have both now.  Just have
building codes that ensure density, and ban large scale developments.<br><br>A corollary is that you have to keep out the biggest developer of
all: the government.  A government that asks "How can we build a
silicon valley?" has probably ensured failure by the way they framed
the question.  You don't build a silicon valley; you let one grow.<br><br><b>Nerds</b><br><br>If you want to attract nerds, you need more than a town with
personality.  You need a town with the right personality.  Nerds
are a distinct subset of the creative class, with different tastes
from the rest.  You can see this most clearly in New York, which
attracts a lot of creative people, but few nerds. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>What nerds like is the kind of town where people walk around smiling.
This excludes LA, where no one walks at all, and also New York,
where people walk, but not smiling. When I was in grad school in
Boston, a friend came to visit from New York.  On the subway back
from the airport she asked "Why is everyone smiling?"  I looked and
they weren't smiling.  They just looked like they were compared to
the facial expressions she was used to.<br><br>If you've lived in New York, you know where these facial expressions
come from.  It's the kind of place where your mind may be excited,
but your body knows it's having a bad time.  People don't so much
enjoy living there as endure it for the sake of the excitement.
And if you like certain kinds of excitement, New York is incomparable.
It's a hub of glamour, a magnet for all the shorter half-life
isotopes of style and fame.<br><br>Nerds don't care about glamour, so to them the appeal of New York
is a mystery.  People who like New York will pay a fortune for a
small, dark, noisy apartment in order to live in a town where the
cool people are really cool.  A nerd looks at that deal and sees
only: pay a fortune for a small, dark, noisy apartment.<br><br>Nerds <i>will</i> pay a premium to live in a town where the smart people
are really smart, but you don't have to pay as much for that.  It's
supply and demand: glamour is popular, so you have to pay a lot for
it.<br><br>Most nerds like quieter pleasures.  They like cafes instead of
clubs; used bookshops instead of fashionable clothing shops; hiking
instead of dancing; sunlight instead of tall buildings.  A nerd's
idea of paradise is Berkeley or Boulder.<br><br><b>Youth</b><br><br>It's the young nerds who start startups, so it's those specifically
the city has to appeal to.  The startup hubs in the US are all
young-feeling towns.  This doesn't mean they have to be new.
Cambridge has the oldest town plan in America, but it feels young
because it's full of students.<br><br>What you can't have, if you want to create a silicon valley, is a
large, existing population of stodgy people.  It would be a waste
of time to try to reverse the fortunes of a declining industrial town
like Detroit or Philadelphia by trying to encourage startups.  Those
places have too much momentum in the wrong direction.  You're better
off starting with a blank slate in the form of a small town.  Or
better still, if there's a town young people already flock to, that
one.<br><br>The Bay Area was a magnet for the young and optimistic for decades
before it was associated with technology.  It was a place people
went in search of something new.  And so it became synonymous with
California nuttiness.  There's still a lot of that there.  If you
wanted to start a new fad-- a new way to focus one's "energy," for
example, or a new category of things not to eat-- the Bay Area would
be the place to do it.  But a place that tolerates oddness in the
search for the new is exactly what you want in a startup hub, because
economically that's what startups are.  Most good startup ideas
seem a little crazy; if they were obviously good ideas, someone
would have done them already.<br><br>(How many people are going to want computers in their <i>houses</i>?
What, <i>another</i> search engine?)<br><br>That's the connection between technology and liberalism.  Without
exception the high-tech cities in the US are also the most liberal.
But it's not because liberals are smarter that this is so.  It's
because liberal cities tolerate odd ideas, and smart people by
definition have odd ideas.<br><br>Conversely, a town that gets praised for being "solid" or representing
"traditional values" may be a fine place to live, but it's never
going to succeed as a startup hub.  The 2004 presidential election,
though a disaster in other respects, conveniently supplied us with
a county-by-county <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2004/countymaplinearlarge.png">
map</a> of such places.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>To attract the young, a town must have an intact center.  In most
American cities the center has been abandoned, and the growth, if
any, is in the suburbs.  Most American cities have been turned
inside out. But none of the startup hubs has: not San Francisco,
or Boston, or Seattle.  They all have intact centers.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font>
My guess is that no city with a dead center could be turned into a
startup hub.  Young people don't want to live in the suburbs.<br><br>Within the US, the two cities I think could most easily be turned
into new silicon valleys are Boulder and Portland.  Both have the
kind of effervescent feel that attracts the young.  They're each
only a great university short of becoming a silicon valley, if they
wanted to.<br><br><b>Time</b><br><br>A great university near an attractive town.  Is that all it takes?
That was all it took to make the original Silicon Valley.  Silicon
Valley traces its origins to William Shockley, one of the inventors
of the transistor.  He did the research that won him the Nobel Prize
at Bell Labs, but when he started his own company in 1956 he moved
to Palo Alto to do it.   At the time that was an odd thing to do.
Why did he?  Because he had grown up there and remembered how nice
it was.  Now Palo Alto is suburbia, but then it was a charming
college town-- a charming college town with perfect weather and San
Francisco only an hour away.<br><br>The companies that rule Silicon Valley now are all descended in
various ways from Shockley Semiconductor.  Shockley was a difficult
man, and in 1957 his top people-- "the traitorous eight"-- left to
start a new company, Fairchild Semiconductor.  Among them were
Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, who went on to found Intel, and
Eugene Kleiner, who founded the VC firm Kleiner Perkins.  Forty-two
years later, Kleiner Perkins funded Google, and the partner responsible
for the deal was John Doerr, who came to Silicon Valley in 1974 to
work for Intel.<br><br>So although a lot of the newest companies in Silicon Valley don't
make anything out of silicon, there always seem to be multiple links
back to Shockley.  There's a lesson here: startups beget startups.
People who work for startups start their own.  People who get rich
from startups fund new ones.  I suspect this kind of organic growth
is the only way to produce a startup hub, because it's the only way
to grow the expertise you need.<br><br>That has two important implications.  The first is that you need
time to grow a silicon valley.  The university you could create in
a couple years, but the startup community around it has to grow
organically.   The cycle time is limited by the time it takes a
company to succeed, which probably averages about five years.<br><br>The other implication of the organic growth hypothesis is that you
can't be somewhat of a startup hub.  You either have a self-sustaining
chain reaction, or not.  Observation confirms this too: cities
either have a startup scene, or they don't.  There is no middle
ground.  Chicago has the third largest metropolitan area in America.
As a source of startups it's negligible compared to Seattle, number 15.<br><br>The good news is that the initial seed can be quite small.  Shockley
Semiconductor, though itself not very successful, was big enough.
It brought a critical mass of experts in an important new technology
together in a place they liked enough to stay.<br><br><b>Competing</b><br><br>Of course, a would-be silicon valley faces an obstacle the original
one didn't: it has to compete with Silicon Valley.  Can that be
done?  Probably.<br><br>One of Silicon Valley's biggest advantages is its venture capital
firms.  This was not a factor in Shockley's day, because VC funds
didn't exist.  In fact, Shockley Semiconductor and Fairchild
Semiconductor were not startups at all in our sense.  They were
subsidiaries-- of Beckman Instruments and Fairchild Camera and
Instrument respectively.  Those companies were apparently willing
to establish subsidiaries wherever the experts wanted to live.<br><br>Venture investors, however, prefer to fund startups within an hour's
drive.  For one, they're more likely to notice startups nearby.
But when they do notice startups in other towns they prefer them
to move.  They don't want to have to travel to attend board meetings,
and in any case the odds of succeeding are higher in a startup hub.<br><br>The centralizing effect of venture firms is a double one: they cause
startups to form around them, and those draw in more startups through
acquisitions.  And although the first may be weakening because it's
now so cheap to start some startups, the second seems as strong as ever.
Three of the most admired
"Web 2.0" companies were started outside the usual startup hubs,
but two of them have already been reeled in through acquisitions.<br><br>Such centralizing forces make it harder for new silicon valleys to
get started.  But by no means impossible.  Ultimately power rests
with the founders.  A startup with the best people will beat one
with funding from famous VCs, and a startup that was sufficiently
successful would never have to move.  So a town that
could exert enough pull over the right people could resist and
perhaps even surpass Silicon Valley.<br><br>For all its power, Silicon Valley has a great weakness: the paradise
Shockley found in 1956 is now one giant parking lot.  San Francisco
and Berkeley are great, but they're forty miles away.  Silicon
Valley proper is soul-crushing suburban <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/caterina/34637/">sprawl</a>.  It
has fabulous weather, which makes it significantly better than the
soul-crushing sprawl of most other American cities.  But a competitor
that managed to avoid sprawl would have real leverage.  All a city
needs is to be the kind of place the next traitorous eight look at
and say "I want to stay here," and that would be enough to get the
chain reaction started.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
It's interesting to consider how low this number could be
made.  I suspect five hundred would be enough, even if they could
bring no assets with them.  Probably just thirty, if I could pick them, 
would be enough to turn Buffalo into a significant startup hub.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Bureaucrats manage to allocate research funding moderately
well, but only because (like an in-house VC fund) they outsource
most of the work of selection.  A professor at a famous university
who is highly regarded by his peers will get funding, pretty much
regardless of the proposal.  That wouldn't work for startups, whose
founders aren't sponsored by organizations, and are often unknowns.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
You'd have to do it all at once, or at least a whole department
at a time, because people would be more likely to come if they
knew their friends were.  And you should probably start from scratch,
rather than trying to upgrade an existing university, or much energy
would be lost in friction.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Hypothesis: Any plan in which multiple independent buildings
are gutted or demolished to be "redeveloped" as a single project
is a net loss of personality for the city, with the exception of
the conversion of buildings not previously public, like warehouses.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
A few startups get started in New York, but less
than a tenth as many per capita as in Boston, and mostly
in less nerdy fields like finance and media.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Some blue counties are false positives (reflecting the
remaining power of Democractic party machines), but there are no
false negatives.  You can safely write off all the red counties.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Some "urban renewal" experts took a shot at destroying Boston's
in the 1960s, leaving the area around city hall a bleak <a href="http://www.pps.org/great_public_spaces/one?public_place_id=148">wasteland</a>,
but most neighborhoods successfully resisted them.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Chris Anderson, Trevor Blackwell, Marc Hedlund,

There are a lot of them in Silicon
Valley and Boston, and few in Chicago or Miami.  A country that
wants startups will probably also have to reproduce whatever makes
these clusters form.<br><br>I've claimed that the <a href="siliconvalley.html">recipe</a> is a
great university near a town smart
people like.  If you set up those conditions within the US, startups
will form as inevitably as water droplets condense on a cold piece
of metal.  But when I consider what it would take to reproduce
Silicon Valley in another country, it's clear the US is a particularly
humid environment.  Startups condense more easily here.<br><br>It is by no means a lost cause to try to create a silicon valley
in another country.  There's room not merely to equal Silicon Valley,
but to surpass it.  But if you want to do that, you have to
understand the advantages startups get from being in America.<br><br><b>1. The US Allows Immigration.</b><br><br>For example, I doubt it would be possible to reproduce Silicon
Valley in Japan, because one of Silicon Valley's most distinctive
features is immigration.  Half the people there speak with accents.
And the Japanese don't like immigration.  When they think about how
to make a Japanese silicon valley, I suspect they unconsciously
frame it as how to make one consisting only of Japanese people.
This way of framing the question probably guarantees failure.<br><br>A silicon valley has to be a mecca for the smart and the ambitious,
and you can't have a mecca if you don't let people into it.<br><br>Of course, it's not saying much that America is more open to
immigration than Japan.  Immigration policy is one area where a
competitor could do better.<br><br><b>2. The US Is a Rich Country.</b><br><br>I could see India one day producing a rival to Silicon Valley.
Obviously they have the right people: you can tell that by the
number of Indians in the current Silicon Valley.  The problem with
India itself is that it's still so poor.<br><br>In poor countries, things we take for granted are missing.  A friend
of mine visiting India sprained her ankle falling down the steps
in a railway station.  When she turned to see what had happened,
she found the steps were all different heights.  In industrialized
countries we walk down steps our whole lives and never think about
this, because there's an infrastructure that prevents such a staircase
from being built.<br><br>The US has never been so poor as some countries are now.  There
have never been swarms of beggars in the streets of American cities.
So we have no data about what it takes to get from the swarms-of-beggars
stage to the silicon-valley stage.  Could you have both at once,
or does there have to be some baseline prosperity before you get a
silicon valley?<br><br>I suspect there is some speed limit to the evolution
of an economy.  Economies are made out of people, and attitudes can
only change a certain amount per generation.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>3. The US Is Not (Yet) a Police State.</b><br><br>Another country I could see wanting to have a silicon valley is
China.  But I doubt they could do it yet either.  China still seems
to be a police state, and although present rulers seem enlightened
compared to the last, even enlightened despotism can probably only
get you part way toward being a great economic power.<br><br>It can get you factories for building things designed elsewhere.
Can it get you the designers, though?  Can imagination flourish
where people can't criticize the government?  Imagination means
having odd ideas, and it's hard to have odd ideas about technology
without also having odd ideas about politics.  And in any case,
many technical ideas do have political implications.  So if you
squash dissent, the back pressure will propagate into technical
fields. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Singapore would face a similar problem.  Singapore seems very aware
of the importance of encouraging startups.  But while energetic
government intervention may be able to make a port run efficiently,
it can't coax startups into existence.  A state that bans chewing
gum has a long way to go before it could create a San Francisco.<br><br>Do you need a San Francisco?  Might there not be an alternate route
to innovation that goes through obedience and cooperation instead
of individualism?  Possibly, but I'd bet not.  Most imaginative
people seem to share a certain prickly <a href="gba.html">independence</a>,
whenever and wherever they lived.  You see it in Diogenes telling
Alexander to get out of his light and two thousand years later in
Feynman breaking into safes at Los Alamos.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
Imaginative people
don't want to follow or lead.  They're most productive when everyone
gets to do what they want.<br><br>Ironically, of all rich countries the US has lost the most civil
liberties recently.  But I'm not too worried yet.  I'm hoping once
the present administration is out, the natural openness of American
culture will reassert itself.<br><br><b>4. American Universities Are Better.</b><br><br>You need a great university to seed a silicon valley, and so far
there are few outside the US.  I asked a handful of American computer
science professors which universities in Europe were most admired,
and they all basically said "Cambridge" followed by a long pause
while they tried to think of others.  There don't seem to be many
universities elsewhere that compare with the best in America, at
least in technology.<br><br>In some countries this is the result of a deliberate policy.  The
German and Dutch governments, perhaps from fear of elitism, try to
ensure that all universities are roughly equal in quality.  The
downside is that none are especially good.   The best professors
are spread out, instead of being concentrated as they are in the
US.  This probably makes them less productive, because they don't
have good colleagues to inspire them.  It also means no one university
will be good enough to act as a mecca, attracting talent from abroad
and causing startups to form around it.<br><br>The case of Germany is a strange one.  The Germans invented the
modern university, and up till the 1930s theirs were the best in
the world.  Now they have none that stand out.  As I was mulling
this over, I found myself thinking: "I can understand why German
universities declined in the 1930s, after they excluded Jews.  But
surely they should have bounced back by now."  Then I realized:
maybe not.  There are few Jews left in Germany and most Jews I know
would not want to move there.  And if you took any great American
university and removed the Jews, you'd have some pretty big gaps.
So maybe it would be a lost cause trying to create a silicon valley
in Germany, because you couldn't establish the level of university
you'd need as a seed.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>It's natural for US universities to compete with one another because
so many are private.  To reproduce the quality of American universities
you probably also have to reproduce this.  If universities are
controlled by the central government, log-rolling will pull them
all toward the mean: the new Institute of X will end up at the
university in the district of a powerful politician, instead of
where it should be.<br><br><b>5. You Can Fire People in America.</b><br><br>I think one of the biggest obstacles to creating startups in Europe
is the attitude toward employment.  The famously rigid labor laws
hurt every company, but startups especially, because startups have
the least time to spare for bureaucratic hassles.<br><br>The difficulty of firing people is a particular problem for startups
because they have no redundancy.  Every person has to do their
job well.<br><br>But the problem is more than just that some startup might have a
problem firing someone they needed to.  Across industries and
countries, there's a strong inverse correlation between performance
and job security.  Actors and directors are fired at the end of
each film, so they have to deliver every time.  Junior professors
are fired by default after a few years unless the university chooses
to grant them tenure.  Professional athletes know they'll be pulled
if they play badly for just a couple games.  At the other end of
the scale (at least in the US) are auto workers, New York City
schoolteachers, and civil servants, who are all nearly impossible
to fire.  The trend is so clear that you'd have to be willfully
blind not to see it.<br><br>Performance isn't everything, you say?  Well, are auto workers,
schoolteachers, and civil servants <i>happier</i> than actors,
professors, and professional athletes?<br><br>European public opinion will apparently tolerate people being fired
in industries where they really care about performance.  Unfortunately
the only industry they care enough about so far is soccer.  But
that is at least a precedent.<br><br><b>6. In America Work Is Less Identified with Employment.</b><br><br>The problem in more traditional places like Europe and Japan goes
deeper than the employment laws.  More dangerous is the attitude
they reflect: that an employee is a kind of servant, whom the
employer has a duty to protect.  It used to be that way in America
too.  In 1970 you were still supposed to get a job with a big
company, for whom ideally you'd work your whole career.  In return
the company would take care of you: they'd try not to fire you,
cover your medical expenses, and support you in old age.<br><br>Gradually employment has been shedding such paternalistic overtones
and becoming simply an economic exchange.  But the importance of
the new model is not just that it makes it easier for startups to
grow.  More important, I think, is that it it makes it easier for
people to <i>start</i> startups.<br><br>Even in the US most kids graduating from college still think they're
supposed to get jobs, as if you couldn't be productive without being
someone's employee.  But the less you identify work with employment,
the easier it becomes to start a startup.  When you see your career
as a series of different types of work, instead of a lifetime's
service to a single employer, there's less risk in starting your
own company, because you're only replacing one segment instead of
discarding the whole thing.<br><br>The old ideas are so powerful that even the most successful startup
founders have had to struggle against them.  A year after the
founding of Apple, Steve Wozniak still hadn't quit HP.  He still
planned to work there for life.  And when Jobs found someone to
give Apple serious venture funding, on the condition that Woz quit,
he initially refused, arguing that he'd designed both the Apple I
and the Apple II while working at HP, and there was no reason he
couldn't continue.<br><br><b>7.  America Is Not Too Fussy.</b><br><br>If there are any laws regulating businesses, you can assume larval
startups will break most of them, because they don't know what the
laws are and don't have time to find out.<br><br>For example, many startups in America begin in places where it's
not really legal to run a business.  Hewlett-Packard, Apple, and
Google were all run out of garages.  Many more startups, including
ours, were initially run out of apartments.  If the laws against
such things were actually enforced, most startups wouldn't happen.<br><br>That could be a problem in fussier countries.  If Hewlett and Packard
tried running an electronics company out of their garage in
Switzerland, the old lady next door would report them to the municipal
authorities.<br><br>But the worst problem in other countries is probably the effort
required just to start a company.  A friend of mine started a company
in Germany in the early 90s, and was shocked to discover, among
many other regulations, that you needed $20,000 in capital to
incorporate.  That's one reason I'm not typing this on an Apfel
laptop.  Jobs and Wozniak couldn't have come up with that kind of
money in a company financed by selling a VW bus and an HP calculator.
We couldn't have started Viaweb either.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Here's a tip for governments that want to encourage startups: read
the stories of existing startups, and then try to simulate what
would have happened in your country.  When you hit something that
would have killed Apple, prune it off.<br><br><i>Startups are <a href="marginal.html">marginal</a>.</i>  
They're started by the poor and the
timid; they begin in marginal space and spare time; they're started
by people who are supposed to be doing something else; and though
businesses, their founders often know nothing about business.  Young
startups are fragile.  A society that trims its margins sharply
will kill them all.<br><br><b>8. America Has a Large Domestic Market.</b><br><br>What sustains a startup in the beginning is the prospect of getting
their initial product out.  The successful ones therefore make the
first version as simple as possible.  In the US they usually begin
by making something just for the local market.<br><br>This works in America, because the local market is 300 million
people.  It wouldn't work so well in Sweden.  In a small country,
a startup has a harder task: they have to sell internationally from
the start.<br><br>The EU was designed partly to simulate a single, large domestic
market.  The problem is that the inhabitants still speak many
different languages.  So a software startup in Sweden is still at
a disadvantage relative to one in the US, because they have to deal
with internationalization from the beginning.  It's significant
that the most famous recent startup in Europe, Skype, worked on a
problem that was intrinsically international.<br><br>However, for better or worse it looks as if Europe will in a few
decades speak a single language.  When I was a student in Italy in
1990, few Italians spoke English.  Now all educated people seem to
be expected to-- and Europeans do not like to seem uneducated.  This
is presumably a taboo subject, but if present trends continue,
French and German will eventually go the way of Irish and Luxembourgish:
they'll be spoken in homes and by eccentric nationalists.<br><br><b>9. America Has Venture Funding.</b><br><br>Startups are easier to start in America because funding is easier
to get.  There are now a few VC firms outside the US, but startup
funding doesn't only come from VC firms.  A more important source,
because it's more personal and comes earlier in the process, is
money from individual angel investors.  Google might never have got
to the point where they could raise millions from VC funds if they
hadn't first raised a hundred thousand from Andy Bechtolsheim.  And
he could help them because he was one of the founders of Sun.  This
pattern is repeated constantly in startup hubs.  It's this pattern
that <i>makes</i> them startup hubs.<br><br>The good news is, all you have to do to get the process rolling is
get those first few startups successfully launched.  If they stick
around after they get rich, startup founders will almost automatically
fund and encourage new startups.<br><br>The bad news is that the cycle is slow.  It probably takes five
years, on average, before a startup founder can make angel investments.
And while governments <i>might</i> be able to set up local VC funds
by supplying the money themselves and recruiting people from existing
firms to run them, only organic growth can produce angel investors.<br><br>Incidentally, America's private universities are one reason there's
so much venture capital.  A lot of the money in VC funds comes from
their endowments.  So another advantage of private universities is
that a good chunk of the country's wealth is managed by enlightened
investors.<br><br><b>10. America Has Dynamic Typing for Careers.</b><br><br>Compared to other industrialized countries the US is disorganized
about routing people into careers.  For example, in America people
often don't decide to go to medical school till they've finished
college.  In Europe they generally decide in high school.<br><br>The European approach reflects the old idea that each person has a
single, definite occupation-- which is not far from the idea that
each person has a natural "station" in life.  If this were true,
the most efficient plan would be to discover each person's station
as early as possible, so they could receive the training appropriate
to it.<br><br>In the US things are more haphazard.  But that turns out to be an
advantage as an economy gets more liquid, just as dynamic typing
turns out to work better than static for ill-defined problems.  This
is particularly true with startups.  "Startup founder" is not the
sort of career a high school student would choose.  If you ask at
that age, people will choose conservatively.  They'll choose
well-understood occupations like engineer, or doctor, or lawyer.<br><br>Startups are the kind of thing people don't plan, so you're more
likely to get them in a society where it's ok to make career decisions
on the fly.<br><br>For example, in theory the purpose of a PhD program is to train you
to do research.  But fortunately in the US this is another rule
that isn't very strictly enforced.  In the US most people in CS PhD
programs are there simply because they wanted to learn more.  They
haven't decided what they'll do afterward.  So American grad schools
spawn a lot of startups, because students don't feel they're failing
if they don't go into research.<br><br>Those worried about America's "competitiveness" often suggest
spending more on public schools.  But perhaps America's lousy public
schools have a hidden advantage.  Because they're so bad, the kids
adopt an attitude of waiting for college.  I did; I knew I was
learning so little that I wasn't even learning what the choices
were, let alone which to choose.  This is demoralizing, but it does
at least make you keep an open mind.<br><br>Certainly if I had to choose between bad high schools and good
universities, like the US, and good high schools and bad universities,
like most other industrialized countries, I'd take the US system.
Better to make everyone feel like a late bloomer than a failed child
prodigy.<br><br><b>Attitudes</b><br><br>There's one item conspicuously missing from this list: American
attitudes.  Americans are said to be more entrepreneurial, and less
afraid of risk.  But America has no monopoly on this.  Indians and
Chinese seem plenty entrepreneurial, perhaps more than Americans.<br><br>Some say Europeans are less energetic, but I don't believe it.  I
think the problem with Europe is not that they lack balls, but that
they lack examples.<br><br>Even in the US, the most successful startup founders are often
technical people who are quite timid, initially, about the idea of
starting their own company. Few are the sort of backslapping
extroverts one thinks of as typically American.  They can usually
only summon up the activation energy to start a startup when they
meet people who've done it and realize they could too.<br><br>I think what holds back European hackers is simply that they don't
meet so many people who've done it. You see that variation even
within the US.  Stanford students are more entrepreneurial than
Yale students, but not because of some difference in their characters;
the Yale students just have fewer examples.<br><br>I admit there seem to be different attitudes toward ambition in
Europe and the US.  In the US it's ok to be overtly ambitious, and
in most of Europe it's not.  But this can't be an intrinsically
European quality; previous generations of Europeans were as ambitious
as Americans.  What happened?  My hypothesis is that ambition was
discredited by the terrible things ambitious people did in the first
half of the twentieth century.  Now swagger is out. (Even now the
image of a very ambitious German presses a button or two, doesn't
it?)<br><br>It would be surprising if European attitudes weren't affected by
the disasters of the twentieth century.  It takes a while to be
optimistic after events like that.  But ambition is human nature.
Gradually it will re-emerge.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>How To Do Better</b><br><br>I don't mean to suggest by this list that America is the perfect
place for startups.  It's the best place so far, but the sample
size is small, and "so far" is not very long.   On historical time 
scales, what we have now is just a
prototype.<br><br>So let's look at Silicon Valley the way you'd look at a product
made by a competitor.  What weaknesses could you exploit?  How could
you make something users would like better?  The users in this case
are those critical few thousand people you'd like to move to your
silicon valley.<br><br>To start with, Silicon Valley is too far from San Francisco.  Palo
Alto, the original ground zero, is about thirty miles away, and the
present center more like forty.  So people who come to work in
Silicon Valley face an unpleasant choice: either live in the boring
sprawl of the valley proper, or live in San Francisco and endure
an hour commute each way.<br><br>The best thing would be if the silicon valley were not merely closer
to the interesting city, but interesting itself.  And there is a
lot of room for improvement here.  Palo Alto is not so bad, but
everything built since is the worst sort of strip development.  You
can measure how demoralizing it is by the number of people who will
sacrifice two hours a day commuting rather than live there.<br><br>Another area in which you could easily surpass Silicon Valley is
public transportation.  There is a train running the length of it,
and by American standards it's not bad.  Which is to say that to
Japanese or Europeans it would seem like something out of the third
world.<br><br>The kind of people you want to attract to your silicon valley like
to get around by train, bicycle, and on foot.  So if you want to
beat America, design a town that puts cars last.  It will be a while
before any American city can bring itself to do that.<br><br><b>Capital Gains</b><br><br>There are also a couple things you could do to beat America at the
national level.  One would be to have lower capital gains taxes.
It doesn't seem critical to have the lowest <i>income</i> taxes,
because to take advantage of those, people have to move.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font>
But
if capital gains rates vary, you move assets, not yourself, so
changes are reflected at market speeds.  The lower the rate, the
cheaper it is to buy stock in growing companies as opposed to real
estate, or bonds, or stocks bought for the dividends they pay.<br><br>So if you want to encourage startups you should have a low rate on
capital gains.  Politicians are caught between a rock and a hard
place here, however: make the capital gains rate low and be accused
of creating "tax breaks for the rich," or make it high and starve
growing companies of investment capital.   As Galbraith said,
politics is a matter of choosing between the unpalatable and the
disastrous.  A lot of governments experimented with the disastrous
in the twentieth century; now the trend seems to be toward the
merely unpalatable.<br><br>Oddly enough, the leaders now are European countries like Belgium,
which has a capital gains tax rate of zero.<br><br><b>Immigration</b><br><br>The other place you could beat the US would be with smarter immigration
policy.  There are huge gains to be made here.  Silicon valleys are
made of people, remember.<br><br>Like a company whose software runs on Windows, those in the current
Silicon Valley are all too aware of the shortcomings of the INS,
but there's little they can do about it.  They're hostages of the
platform.<br><br>America's immigration system has never been well run, and since
2001 there has been an additional admixture of paranoia.  What
fraction of the smart people who want to come to America can even
get in?  I doubt even half.  Which means if you made a competing
technology hub that let in all smart people, you'd immediately get
more than half the world's top talent, for free.<br><br>US immigration policy is particularly ill-suited to startups, because
it reflects a model of work from the 1970s.  It assumes good technical
people have college degrees, and that work means working for a big
company.<br><br>If you don't have a college degree you can't get an H1B visa, the
type usually issued to programmers.  But a test that excludes Steve
Jobs, Bill Gates, and Michael Dell can't be a good one.  Plus you
can't get a visa for working on your own company, only for working
as an employee of someone else's.  And if you want to apply for
citizenship you daren't work for a startup at all, because if your
sponsor goes out of business, you have to start over.<br><br>American immigration policy keeps out most smart people, and channels
the rest into unproductive jobs.  It would be easy to do better.
Imagine if, instead, you treated immigration like recruiting-- if
you made a conscious effort to seek out the smartest people and get
them to come to your country.<br><br>A country that got immigration right would have a huge advantage.
At this point you could become a mecca for smart people simply by
having an immigration system that let them in.<br><br><b>A Good Vector</b><br><br>If you look at the kinds of things you have to do to create an
environment where startups condense, none are great sacrifices.
Great universities?  Livable towns?  Civil liberties?  Flexible
employment laws?  Immigration policies that let in smart people?
Tax laws that encourage growth?  It's not as if you have to risk
destroying your country to get a silicon valley; these are all good
things in their own right.<br><br>And then of course there's the question, can you afford not to?  I
can imagine a future in which the default choice of ambitious young
people is to start their <a href="hiring.html">own</a> company
rather than work for someone else's.  I'm not sure that will happen,
but it's where the trend points now.  And if that is the future,
places that don't have startups will be a whole step behind,
like those that missed the Industrial Revolution.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
On the verge of the Industrial Revolution, England was already
the richest country in the world.  As far as such things can be
compared, per capita income in England in 1750 was higher than
India's in 1960.<br><br>Deane, Phyllis, <i>The First Industrial Revolution</i>, Cambridge
University Press, 1965.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]

Dynasty, when the country turned its back on industrialization at
the command of the court.  One of Europe's advantages was that it
had no government powerful enough to do that.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]

For similar reasons it might be a lost cause to try to establish
a silicon valley in Israel.  Instead of no Jews moving there, only
Jews would move there, and I don't think you could build a silicon
valley out of just Jews any more than you could out of just Japanese.<br><br>(This is not a remark about the qualities of these groups, just their
sizes.  Japanese are only about 2% of the world population, and
Jews about .2%.)<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]

For most of the twentieth century, Europeans looked back on
the summer of 1914 as if they'd been living in a dream world.  It
seems more accurate (or at least, as accurate) to call the years
after 1914 a nightmare than to call those before a dream.  A lot
of the optimism Europeans consider distinctly American is simply
what they too were feeling in 1914.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
The point where things start to go wrong seems to be about
50%.  Above that people get serious about tax avoidance.  The reason
is that the payoff for avoiding tax grows hyperexponentially (x/1-x
for 0 &lt; x &lt; 1).  If your income tax rate is 10%, moving to Monaco
would only give you 11% more income, which wouldn't even cover the
extra cost.  If it's 90%, you'd get ten times as much income.  And
at 98%, as it was briefly in Britain in the 70s, moving to Monaco
would give you fifty times as much income.  It seems quite likely
that European governments of the 70s never drew this curve.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Matthias Felleisen, Jessica

<p>
June 2006<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from talks at Usenix 2006 and
Railsconf 2006.)</i><br><br>A couple years ago my friend Trevor and I went to look at the Apple
garage.  As we stood there, he said that as a kid growing up in
Saskatchewan he'd been amazed at the dedication Jobs and Wozniak
must have had to work in a garage.<br><br>"Those guys must have been
freezing!"<br><br>That's one of California's hidden advantages: the mild climate means
there's lots of marginal space.  In cold places that margin gets
trimmed off.  There's a sharper line between outside and inside,
and only projects that are officially sanctioned — by organizations,
or parents, or wives, or at least by oneself — get proper indoor
space.  That raises the activation energy for new ideas.  You can't
just tinker. You have to justify.<br><br>Some of Silicon Valley's most famous companies began in garages:
Hewlett-Packard in 1938, Apple in 1976, Google in 1998.  In Apple's
case the garage story is a bit of an urban legend.  Woz says all
they did there was assemble some computers, and that he did all the
actual design of the Apple I and Apple II in his apartment or his
cube at HP.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font>
This was apparently too marginal even for Apple's PR
people.<br><br>By conventional standards, Jobs and Wozniak were marginal people
too.  Obviously they were smart, but they can't have looked good
on paper.  They were at the time a pair of college dropouts with
about three years of school between them, and hippies to boot.
Their previous business experience consisted of making "blue boxes"
to hack into the phone system, a business with the rare distinction
of being both illegal and unprofitable.<br><br><b>Outsiders</b><br><br>Now a startup operating out of a garage in Silicon Valley would
feel part of an exalted tradition, like the poet in his garret, or
the painter who can't afford to heat his studio and thus has to
wear a beret indoors.  But in 1976 it didn't seem so cool.  The
world hadn't yet realized that starting a computer company was in
the same category as being a writer or a painter. It hadn't been
for long.  Only in the preceding couple years had the dramatic fall
in the cost of hardware allowed outsiders to compete.<br><br>In 1976, everyone looked down on a company operating out of a garage,
including the founders.  One of the first things Jobs did when they
got some money was to rent office space.  He wanted Apple to seem
like a real company.<br><br>They already had something few real companies ever have: a fabulously well
designed product.  You'd think they'd have had more confidence.
But I've talked to a lot of startup founders, and it's always this
way.  They've built something that's going to change the world, and
they're worried about some nit like not having proper business
cards.<br><br>That's the paradox I want to explore: great new things often come
from the margins, and yet the people who discover them are looked
down on by everyone, including themselves.<br><br>It's an old idea that new things come from the margins. I want to
examine its internal structure.  Why do great ideas come from the
margins?  What kind of ideas?  And is there anything we can do to
encourage the process?<br><br><b>Insiders</b><br><br>One reason so many good ideas come from the margin is simply that
there's so much of it. There have to be more outsiders than insiders,
if insider means anything.  If the number of outsiders is huge it
will always seem as if a lot of ideas come from them, even if few
do per capita.  But I think there's more going on than this.  There
are real disadvantages to being an insider, and in some kinds of
work they can outweigh the advantages.<br><br>Imagine, for example, what would happen if the government decided
to commission someone to write an official Great American Novel.
First there'd be a huge ideological squabble over who to choose.
Most of the best writers would be excluded for having offended one
side or the other.  Of the remainder, the smart ones would refuse
such a job, leaving only a few with the wrong sort of ambition.
The committee would choose one at the height of his career — that
is, someone whose best work was behind him — and hand over the
project with copious free advice about how the book should show in
positive terms the strength and diversity of the American people,
etc, etc.<br><br>The unfortunate writer would then sit down to work with a huge
weight of expectation on his shoulders.  Not wanting to blow such
a public commission, he'd play it safe.  This book had better command
respect, and the way to ensure that would be to make it a tragedy.
Audiences have to be enticed to laugh, but if you kill people they
feel obliged to take you seriously.  As everyone knows, America
plus tragedy equals the Civil War, so that's what it would have to
be about. When finally
completed twelve years later, the book would be a 900-page pastiche
of existing popular novels — roughly <i>Gone with the Wind</i> plus
<i>Roots</i>.  But its bulk and celebrity would make it a bestseller
for a few months, until blown out of the water by a talk-show host's
autobiography.  The book would be made into a movie and thereupon
forgotten, except by the more waspish sort of reviewers, among whom
it would be a byword for bogusness like Milli Vanilli or <i>Battlefield
Earth</i>.<br><br>Maybe I got a little carried away with this example.  And yet is
this not at each point the way such a project would play out?  The
government knows better than to get into the novel business, but
in other fields where they have a natural monopoly, like nuclear
waste dumps, aircraft carriers, and regime change, you'd find plenty
of projects isomorphic to this one — and indeed, plenty that were
less successful.<br><br>This little thought experiment suggests a few of the disadvantages
of insider projects: the selection of the wrong kind of people, the
excessive scope, the inability to take risks, the need to seem
serious, the weight of expectations, the power of vested interests,
the undiscerning audience, and perhaps most dangerous, the tendency
of such work to become a duty rather than a pleasure.<br><br><b>Tests</b><br><br>A world with outsiders and insiders implies some kind of test for
distinguishing between them.  And the trouble with most tests for
selecting elites is that there are two ways to pass them: to be
good at what they try to measure, and to be good at hacking the
test itself.<br><br>So the first question to ask about a field is how honest its tests
are, because this tells you what it means to be an outsider.  This
tells you how much to trust your instincts when you disagree with
authorities, whether it's worth going through the usual channels
to become one yourself, and perhaps whether you want to work in
this field at all.<br><br>Tests are least hackable when there are consistent standards for
quality, and the people running the test really care about its
integrity.  Admissions to PhD programs in the hard sciences are
fairly honest, for example.  The professors will get whoever they
admit as their own grad students, so they try hard to choose well,
and they have a fair amount of data to go on.  Whereas undergraduate
admissions seem to be much more hackable.<br><br>One way to tell whether a field has consistent standards is the
overlap between the leading practitioners and the people who teach
the subject in universities.  At one end of the scale you have
fields like math and physics, where nearly all the teachers are
among the best practitioners.  In the middle are medicine, law,
history, architecture, and computer science, where many are.  At
the bottom are business, literature, and the visual arts, where
there's almost no overlap between the teachers and the leading
practitioners.  It's this end that gives rise to phrases like "those
who can't do, teach."<br><br>Incidentally, this scale might be helpful in deciding what to study
in college.  When I was in college the rule seemed to be that you
should study whatever you were most interested in.  But in retrospect
you're probably better off studying something moderately interesting
with someone who's good at it than something very interesting with
someone who isn't.  You often hear people say that you shouldn't
major in business in college, but this is actually an instance of
a more general rule: don't learn things from teachers who are bad
at them.<br><br>How much you should worry about being an outsider depends on the
quality of the insiders.  If you're an amateur mathematician and
think you've solved a famous open problem, better go back and check.
When I was in grad school, a friend in the math department had the
job of replying to people who sent in proofs of Fermat's last theorem
and so on, and it did not seem as if he saw it as a valuable source
of tips — more like manning a mental health hotline.  Whereas if
the stuff you're writing seems different from what English professors
are interested in, that's not necessarily a problem.<br><br><b>Anti-Tests</b><br><br>Where the method of selecting the elite is thoroughly corrupt, most
of the good people will be outsiders.  In art, for example, the
image of the poor, misunderstood genius is not just one possible
image of a great artist: it's the <i>standard</i> image.  I'm not
saying it's correct, incidentally, but it is telling how well this
image has stuck.  You couldn't make a rap like that stick to math
or medicine.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>If it's corrupt enough, a test becomes an anti-test, filtering out
the people it should select by making them to do things only the
wrong people would do.  <a href="nerds.html">Popularity</a> in high school
seems to be such a test.  There are plenty of similar ones in the grownup
world.  For example, rising up through the hierarchy of the average
big company demands an attention to politics few thoughtful people
could spare.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
Someone like Bill Gates can grow a company under
him, but it's hard to imagine him having the patience to climb the
corporate ladder at General Electric — or Microsoft, actually.<br><br>It's kind of strange when you think about it, because lord-of-the-flies
schools and bureaucratic companies are both the default.  There are
probably a lot of people who go from one to the other and never
realize the whole world doesn't work this way.<br><br>I think that's one reason big companies are so often blindsided by
startups.  
People at big companies don't realize the extent to which
they live in an environment that is one large, ongoing test for the
wrong qualities.<br><br>If you're an outsider, your best chances for beating insiders are
obviously in fields where corrupt tests select a lame elite.  But
there's a catch: if the tests are corrupt, your victory won't be
recognized, at least in your lifetime.  You may feel you don't need
that, but history suggests it's dangerous to work in fields with
corrupt tests.  You may beat the insiders, and yet not do as good
work, on an absolute scale, as you would in a field that was more
honest.<br><br>Standards in art, for example, were almost as corrupt in the first
half of the eighteenth century as they are today.  This was the era
of those fluffy idealized portraits of countesses with their lapdogs.
<a href="largilliere-chardin.html">Chardin</a> 
decided to skip all that and paint ordinary things as he
saw them.  He's now considered the best of that period — and yet
not the equal of Leonardo or Bellini or Memling, who all had the
additional encouragement of honest standards.<br><br>It can be worth participating in a corrupt contest, however, if
it's followed by another that isn't corrupt.  For example, it would
be worth competing with a company that can spend more than you on
marketing, as long as you can survive to the next round, when
customers compare your actual products.  Similarly, you shouldn't
be discouraged by the comparatively corrupt test of college admissions,
because it's followed immediately by less hackable tests.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Risk</b><br><br>Even in a field with honest tests, there are still advantages to
being an outsider.  The most obvious is that outsiders have nothing
to lose.  They can do risky things, and if they fail, so what?  Few
will even notice.<br><br>The eminent, on the other hand, are weighed down by their eminence.
Eminence is like a suit: it impresses the wrong people, and it
constrains the wearer.<br><br>Outsiders should realize the advantage they have here.  Being able
to take risks is hugely valuable.  Everyone values safety too much,
both the obscure and the eminent.  No one wants to look like a fool.
But it's very useful to be able to.  If most of your ideas aren't
stupid, you're probably being too conservative.  You're not bracketing
the problem.<br><br>Lord Acton said we should judge talent at its best and character
at its worst.  For example, if you write one great book and ten bad
ones, you still count as a great writer — or at least, a better
writer than someone who wrote eleven that were merely good.  Whereas
if you're a quiet, law-abiding citizen most of the time but
occasionally cut someone up and bury them in your backyard, you're
a bad guy.<br><br>Almost everyone makes the mistake of treating ideas as if they were
indications of character rather than talent — as if having a stupid
idea made you stupid.   There's a huge weight of tradition advising
us to play it safe.  "Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps
silent," says the Old Testament (Proverbs 17:28).<br><br>Well, that may be fine advice for a bunch of goatherds in Bronze
Age Palestine.  There conservatism would be the order of the day.
But times have changed.  It might still be reasonable to stick with
the Old Testament in political questions, but materially the world
now has a lot more state.  Tradition is less of a guide, not just
because things change faster, but because the space of possibilities
is so large.   The more complicated the world gets, the more valuable
it is to be willing to look like a fool.<br><br><b>Delegation</b><br><br>And yet the more successful people become, the more heat they get
if they screw up — or even seem to screw up.  In this respect, as
in many others, the eminent are prisoners of their own success.  So
the best way to understand the advantages of being an outsider may
be to look at the disadvantages of being an insider.<br><br>If you ask eminent people what's wrong with their lives, the first
thing they'll complain about is the lack of time.  A friend of mine
at Google is fairly high up in the company and went to work for
them long before they went public.  In other words, he's now rich
enough not to have to work.  I asked him if he could still endure
the annoyances of having a job, now that he didn't have to.  And
he said that there weren't really any annoyances, except — and he
got a wistful look when he said this — that he got <i>so much
email</i>.<br><br>The eminent feel like everyone wants to take a bite out of them.
The problem is so widespread that people pretending to be eminent
do it by pretending to be overstretched.<br><br>The lives of the eminent become scheduled, and that's not good for
thinking.  One of the great advantages of being an outsider is long,
uninterrupted blocks of time.  That's what I remember about grad
school: apparently endless supplies of time, which I spent worrying
about, but not writing, my dissertation.  Obscurity is like health
food — unpleasant, perhaps, but good for you.  Whereas fame tends
to be like the alcohol produced by fermentation. When it reaches
a certain concentration, it kills off the yeast that produced it.<br><br>The eminent generally respond to the shortage of time by turning
into managers.  They don't have time to work.  They're surrounded
by junior people they're supposed to help or supervise.  The obvious
solution is to have the junior people do the work.  Some good
stuff happens this way, but there are problems it doesn't work so
well for: the kind where it helps to have everything in one head.<br><br>For example, it recently emerged that the famous glass artist Dale
Chihuly hasn't actually blown glass for 27 years.  He has assistants
do the work for him.  But one of the most valuable sources of ideas
in the visual arts is the resistance of the medium.  That's why oil
paintings look so different from watercolors.  In principle you
could make any mark in any medium; in practice the medium steers
you.  And if you're no longer doing the work yourself, you stop
learning from this.<br><br>So if you want to beat those eminent enough to delegate, one way
to do it is to take advantage of direct contact with the medium.
In the arts it's obvious how: blow your own glass, edit your own
films, stage your own plays.  And in the process pay close attention
to accidents and to new ideas you have on the fly.  This technique
can be generalized to any sort of work: if you're an outsider, don't
be ruled by plans.  Planning is often just a weakness forced on
those who delegate.<br><br>Is there a general rule for finding problems best solved in one
head?  Well, you can manufacture them by taking any project usually
done by multiple people and trying to do it all yourself.  Wozniak's
work was a classic example: he did everything himself, hardware and
software, and the result was miraculous.  He claims not one bug was
ever found in the Apple II, in either hardware or software.<br><br>Another way to find good problems to solve in one head is to focus
on the grooves in the chocolate bar — the places where tasks are
divided when they're split between several people.  If you want to
beat delegation, focus on a vertical slice: for example, be both
writer and editor, or both design buildings and construct them.<br><br>One especially good groove to span is the one between tools and
things made with them.  For example, programming languages and
applications are usually written by different people, and this is
responsible for a lot of the worst flaws in 
<a href="hundred.html">programming languages</a>.
I think every language should be designed simultaneously with a
large application written in it, the way C was with Unix.<br><br>Techniques for competing with delegation translate well into business,
because delegation is endemic there.  Instead of avoiding it as a
drawback of senility, many companies embrace it as a sign of maturity.
In big companies software is often designed, implemented, and sold
by three separate types of people.  In startups one person may have
to do all three.  And though this feels stressful, it's one reason
startups win.  The needs of customers and the means of satisfying
them are all in one head.<br><br><b>Focus</b><br><br>The very skill of insiders can be a weakness.  Once someone is good
at something, they tend to spend all their time doing that.  This
kind of focus is very valuable, actually.  Much of the skill of
experts is the ability to ignore false trails.  But focus has
drawbacks: you don't learn from other fields, and when a new approach
arrives, you may be the last to notice.<br><br>For outsiders this translates into two ways to win.  One is to work
on a variety of things.  Since you can't derive as much benefit
(yet) from a narrow focus, you may as well cast a wider net and
derive what benefit you can from similarities between fields.  Just
as you can compete with delegation by working on larger vertical
slices, you can compete with specialization by working on larger
horizontal slices — by both writing and illustrating your book, for
example.<br><br>The second way to compete with focus is to see what focus overlooks.
In particular, new things.  So if you're not good at anything yet,
consider working on something so new that no one else is either.
It won't have any prestige yet, if no one is good at it, but you'll
have it all to yourself.<br><br>The potential of a new medium is usually underestimated, precisely
because no one has yet explored its possibilities.  Before 
<a href="pilate.html">Durer</a>
tried making engravings, no one took them very seriously.  Engraving
was for making little devotional images — basically fifteenth century
baseball cards of saints.  Trying to make masterpieces in this
medium must have seemed to Durer's contemporaries the way that,
say, making masterpieces in 
<a href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/artist/clowes/clowes.html">comics</a> 
might seem to the average person
today.<br><br>In the computer world we get not new mediums but new platforms: the
minicomputer, the microprocessor, the web-based application.  At
first they're always dismissed as being unsuitable for real work.
And yet someone always decides to try anyway, and it turns out you
can do more than anyone expected.  So in the future when you hear
people say of a new platform: yeah, it's popular and cheap, but not
ready yet for real work, jump on it.<br><br>As well as being more comfortable working on established lines,
insiders generally have a vested interest in perpetuating them.
The professor who made his reputation by discovering some new idea
is not likely to be the one to discover its replacement.  This is
particularly true with companies, who have not only skill and pride
anchoring them to the status quo, but money as well. The Achilles
heel of successful companies is their inability to cannibalize
themselves.  Many innovations consist of replacing something with
a cheaper alternative, and companies just don't want to see a path
whose immediate effect is to cut an existing source of revenue.<br><br>So if you're an outsider you should actively seek out contrarian
projects.  Instead of working on things the eminent have made
prestigious, work on things that could steal that prestige.<br><br>The really juicy new approaches are not the ones insiders reject
as impossible, but those they ignore as undignified.  For example,
after Wozniak designed the Apple II he offered it first to his
employer, HP.  They passed.  One of the reasons was that, to save
money, he'd designed the Apple II to use a TV as a monitor, and HP
felt they couldn't produce anything so declasse.<br><br><b>Less</b><br><br>Wozniak used a TV as a monitor for the simple reason that he couldn't
afford a monitor.  Outsiders are not merely free but compelled to
make things that are cheap and lightweight.  And both are good bets
for growth: cheap things spread faster, and lightweight things
evolve faster.<br><br>The eminent, on the other hand, are almost forced to work on a large
scale.  Instead of garden sheds they must design huge art museums.
One reason they work on big things is that they can: like our
hypothetical novelist, they're flattered by such opportunities.
They also know that big projects will by their sheer bulk impress
the audience.  A garden shed, however lovely, would be easy to
ignore; a few might even snicker at it.  You can't snicker at a
giant museum, no matter how much you dislike it.  And finally, there
are all those people the eminent have working for them; they have
to choose projects that can keep them all busy.<br><br>Outsiders are free of all this.  They can work on small things, and
there's something very pleasing about small things.  Small things
can be perfect; big ones always have something wrong with them.
But there's a 
<a href="isetta.html">magic</a> 
in small things that goes beyond such rational
explanations.  All kids know it.  Small things have more personality.<br><br>Plus making them is more fun.  You can do what you want; you don't
have to satisfy committees.  And perhaps most important, small
things can be done fast.  The prospect of seeing the finished project
hangs in the air like the smell of dinner cooking.  If you work
fast, maybe you could have it done tonight.<br><br>Working on small things is also a good way to learn.  The most
important kinds of learning happen one project at a time.  ("Next
time, I won't...")  The faster you cycle through projects, the
faster you'll evolve.<br><br>Plain materials have a charm like small scale.  And in addition
there's the challenge of making do with less.  Every designer's
ears perk up at the mention of that game, because it's a game you
can't lose.  Like the JV playing the varsity, if you even tie, you
win.  So paradoxically there are cases where fewer resources yield
better results, because the designers' pleasure at their own ingenuity
more than compensates.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>So if you're an outsider, take advantage of your ability to make
small and inexpensive things.  Cultivate the pleasure and simplicity
of that kind of work; one day you'll miss it.<br><br><b>Responsibility</b><br><br>When you're old and eminent, what will you miss about being young
and obscure?  What people seem to miss most is the lack of
responsibilities.<br><br>Responsibility is an occupational disease of eminence.  In principle
you could avoid it, just as in principle you could avoid getting
fat as you get old, but few do.  I sometimes suspect that responsibility
is a trap and that the most virtuous route would be to shirk it,
but regardless it's certainly constraining.<br><br>When you're an outsider you're constrained too, of course.  You're
short of money, for example.  But that constrains you in different
ways.  How does responsibility constrain you?  The worst thing is
that it allows you not to focus on real work.  Just as the most
dangerous forms of 
<a href="procrastination.html">procrastination</a> 
are those that seem like work,
the danger of responsibilities is not just that they can consume a
whole day, but that they can do it without setting off the
kind of alarms you'd set off if you spent a whole day sitting on a
park bench.<br><br>A lot of the pain of being an outsider is being aware of one's own
procrastination.  But this is actually a good thing.  You're at
least close enough to work that the smell of it makes you hungry.<br><br>As an outsider, you're just one step away from getting things done.
A huge step, admittedly, and one that most people never seem to
make, but only one step.  If you can summon up the energy to get
started, you can work on projects with an intensity (in both senses)
that few insiders can match.  For insiders work turns into a duty,
laden with responsibilities and expectations.  It's never so pure
as it was when they were young.<br><br>Work like a dog being taken for a walk, instead of an ox being yoked
to the plow.  That's what they miss.<br><br><b>Audience</b><br><br>A lot of outsiders make the mistake of doing the opposite; they
admire the eminent so much that they copy even their flaws.  Copying
is a good way to learn, but copy the right things.  When I was in
college I imitated the pompous diction of famous professors.  But
this wasn't what <i>made</i> them eminent — it was more a flaw their
eminence had allowed them to sink into.   Imitating it was like
pretending to have gout in order to seem rich.<br><br>Half the distinguishing qualities of the eminent are actually
disadvantages.  Imitating these is not only a waste of time, but
will make you seem a fool to your models, who are often well aware
of it.<br><br>What are the genuine advantages of being an insider?  The greatest
is an audience.  It often seems to outsiders that the great advantage
of insiders is money — that they have the resources to do what they
want.  But so do people who inherit money, and that doesn't seem
to help, not as much as an audience.  It's good for morale to know
people want to see what you're making; it draws work out of you.<br><br>If I'm right that the defining advantage of insiders is an audience,
then we live in exciting times, because just in the last ten years
the Internet has made audiences a lot more liquid.  Outsiders don't
have to content themselves anymore with a proxy audience of a few
smart friends.  Now, thanks to the Internet, they can start to grow
themselves actual audiences.  This is great news for the marginal,
who retain the advantages of outsiders while increasingly being
able to siphon off what had till recently been the prerogative of
the elite.<br><br>Though the Web has been around for more than ten years, I think
we're just beginning to see its democratizing effects.  Outsiders
are still learning how to steal audiences.  But more importantly,
audiences are still learning how to be stolen — they're still just
beginning to realize how much 
<a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2004/03/15/lott_case.html">deeper</a> bloggers can dig than
journalists, how much
<a href="http://reddit.com">more interesting</a> 
a democratic news site can be than a
front page controlled by editors, and how much
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLbFDMplZDs">funnier</a>
a bunch of kids
with webcams can be than mass-produced sitcoms.<br><br>The big media companies shouldn't worry that people will post their
copyrighted material on YouTube.  They should worry that people
will post their own stuff on YouTube, and audiences will watch that
instead.<br><br><b>Hacking</b><br><br>If I had to condense the power of the marginal into one sentence
it would be: just try hacking something together.  That phrase draws
in most threads I've mentioned here.   Hacking something together
means deciding what to do as you're doing it, not a subordinate
executing the vision of his boss.  It implies the result won't
be pretty, because it will be made quickly out of inadequate
materials.  It may work, but it won't be the sort of thing the
eminent would want to put their name on.  Something hacked together
means something that barely solves the problem, or maybe doesn't
solve the problem at all, but another you discovered en route.  But
that's ok, because the main value of that initial version is not the
thing itself, but what it leads to.  Insiders who daren't walk
through the mud in their nice clothes will never make it to the
solid ground on the other side.<br><br>The word "try" is an especially valuable component.  I disagree
here with Yoda, who said there is no try.  There is try.  It implies
there's no punishment if you fail.  You're driven by curiosity
instead of duty.  That means the wind of procrastination will be
in your favor: instead of avoiding this work, this will be what you
do as a way of avoiding other work.  And when you do it, you'll be
in a better mood.  The more the work depends on imagination, the
more that matters, because most people have more ideas when they're
happy.<br><br>If I could go back and redo my twenties, that would be one thing
I'd do more of: just try hacking things together.  Like many people
that age, I spent a lot of time worrying about what I should do.
I also spent some time trying to build stuff.  I should have spent
less time worrying and more time building.  If you're not sure what
to do, make something.<br><br>Raymond Chandler's advice to thriller writers was "When in doubt,
have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand."  He followed
that advice.  Judging from his books, he was often in doubt.  But
though the result is occasionally cheesy, it's never boring.  In
life, as in books, action is underrated.<br><br>Fortunately the number of things you can just hack together keeps
increasing.   People fifty years ago would be astonished that one
could just hack together a movie, for example.  Now you can even
hack together distribution.  Just make stuff and put it online.<br><br><b>Inappropriate</b><br><br>If you really want to score big, the place to focus is the margin
of the margin: the territories only recently captured from the
insiders.  That's where you'll find the juiciest projects still
undone, either because they seemed too risky, or simply because
there were too few insiders to explore everything.<br><br>This is why I spend most of my time writing 
<a href="essay.html">essays</a> lately.  The
writing of essays used to be limited to those who could get them
published.  In principle you could have written them and just shown
them to your friends; in practice that didn't work.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font>
An
essayist needs the resistance of an audience, just as an engraver
needs the resistance of the plate.<br><br>Up till a few years ago, writing essays was the ultimate insider's
game.  Domain experts were allowed to publish essays about their
field, but the pool allowed to write on general topics was about
eight people who went to the right parties in New York.  Now the
reconquista has overrun this territory, and, not surprisingly, found
it sparsely cultivated.  There are so many essays yet unwritten.
They tend to be the naughtier ones; the insiders have pretty much
exhausted the motherhood and apple pie topics.<br><br>This leads to my final suggestion: a technique for determining when
you're on the right track.  You're on the right track when people
complain that you're unqualified, or that you've done something
inappropriate.  If people are complaining, that means you're doing
something rather than sitting around, which is the first step.  And
if they're driven to such empty forms of complaint, that means
you've probably done something good.<br><br>If you make something and people complain that it doesn't <i>work</i>,
that's a problem.  But if the worst thing they can hit you with is
your own status as an outsider, that implies that in every other
respect you've succeeded.  Pointing out that someone is unqualified
is as desperate as resorting to racial slurs. It's just a legitimate
sounding way of saying: we don't like your type around here.<br><br>But the best thing of all is when people call what you're doing
inappropriate.  I've been hearing this word all my life and I only
recently realized that it is, in fact, the sound of the homing
beacon.  "Inappropriate" is the null criticism.  It's merely the
adjective form of "I don't like it."<br><br>So that, I think, should be the highest goal for the marginal.  Be
inappropriate.  When you hear people saying that, you're golden.
And they, incidentally, are busted.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
The facts about Apple's early history are from an interview 
with <a href="http://foundersatwork.com/steve-wozniak.html">Steve

As usual the popular image is several decades behind reality.
Now the misunderstood artist is not a chain-smoking drunk who pours
his soul into big, messy canvases that philistines see and say
"that's not art" because it isn't a picture of anything.  The
philistines have now been trained that anything hung on a wall
is art.  Now the misunderstood artist is a coffee-drinking vegan
cartoonist whose work they see and say "that's not art" because it
looks like stuff they've seen in the Sunday paper.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
In fact this would do fairly well as a definition of politics:
what determines rank in the absence of objective tests.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
In high school you're led to believe your whole future depends
on where you go to college, but it turns out only to buy you a couple
years. By your mid-twenties the people worth impressing
already judge you more by what
you've done than where you went to school.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Managers are presumably wondering, how can I make this miracle
happen?  How can I make the people working for me do more with less?
Unfortunately the constraint probably has to be self-imposed.  If
you're <i>expected</i> to do more with less, then you're being
starved, not eating virtuously.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Without the prospect of publication, the closest most people
come to writing essays is to write in a journal.  I find I never
get as deeply into subjects as I do in proper essays.  As the name
implies, you don't go back and rewrite journal entries over
and over for two weeks.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Sarah

to.  Imagine you were going to spend the weekend at a friend's house
on a little island off the coast of Maine.  There are no shops on
the island and you won't be able to leave while you're there.  Also,
you've never been to this house before, so you can't assume it will
have more than any house might.<br><br>What, besides clothes and toiletries, do you make a point of packing?
That's what you're addicted to.  For example, if you find yourself
packing a bottle of vodka (just in case), you may want to stop and
think about that.<br><br>For me the list is four things: books, earplugs, a notebook, and a
pen.<br><br>There are other things I might bring if I thought of it, like music,
or tea, but I can live without them.  I'm not so addicted to caffeine
that I wouldn't risk the house not having any tea, just for a
weekend.<br><br>Quiet is another matter.  I realize it seems a bit eccentric to
take earplugs on a trip to an island off the coast of Maine.  If
anywhere should be quiet, that should.  But what if the person in
the next room snored?  What if there was a kid playing basketball?
(Thump, thump, thump... thump.)  Why risk it?  Earplugs are small.<br><br>Sometimes I can think with noise.  If I already have momentum on
some project, I can work in noisy places.  I can edit an essay or
debug code in an airport.  But airports are not so bad: most of the
noise is whitish.  I couldn't work with the sound of a sitcom coming
through the wall, or a car in the street playing thump-thump music.<br><br>And of course there's another kind of thinking, when you're starting
something new, that requires complete quiet.   You never
know when this will strike. It's just as well to carry plugs.<br><br>The notebook and pen are professional equipment, as it were.  Though
actually there is something druglike about them, in the sense that
their main purpose is to make me feel better.  I hardly ever go
back and read stuff I write down in notebooks.  It's just that if
I can't write things down, worrying about remembering one idea gets
in the way of having the next.  Pen and paper wick ideas.<br><br>The best notebooks I've found are made by a company called Miquelrius.
I use their smallest size, which is about 2.5 x 4 in.
The secret to writing on such
narrow pages is to break words only when you run out of space, like
a Latin inscription.  I use the cheapest plastic Bic ballpoints,
partly because their gluey ink doesn't seep through pages, and
partly so I don't worry about losing them.<br><br>I only started carrying a notebook about three years ago.  Before
that I used whatever scraps of paper I could find.  But the problem
with scraps of paper is that they're not ordered.  In a notebook
you can guess what a scribble means by looking at the pages
around it.  In the scrap era I was constantly finding notes I'd
written years before that might say something I needed to remember,
if I could only figure out what.<br><br>As for books, I know the house would probably have something to
read.  On the average trip I bring four books and only read one of
them, because I find new books to read en route.  Really bringing
books is insurance.<br><br>I realize this dependence on books is not entirely good—that what
I need them for is distraction.  The books I bring on trips are
often quite virtuous, the sort of stuff that might be assigned
reading in a college class.  But I know my motives aren't virtuous.
I bring books because if the world gets boring I need to be able
to slip into another distilled by some writer.  It's like eating
jam when you know you should be eating fruit.<br><br>There is a point where I'll do without books.  I was walking in
some steep mountains once, and decided I'd rather just think, if I
was bored, rather than carry a single unnecessary ounce.  It wasn't
so bad.  I found I could entertain myself by having ideas instead

When I was in high school I spent a lot of time imitating bad
writers.  What we studied in English classes was mostly fiction,
so I assumed that was the highest form of writing.  Mistake number
one.  The stories that seemed to be most admired were ones in which
people suffered in complicated ways.  Anything funny or
gripping was ipso facto suspect, unless it was old enough to be hard to
understand, like Shakespeare or Chaucer.  Mistake number two.  The
ideal medium seemed the short story, which I've since learned had
quite a brief life, roughly coincident with the peak of magazine
publishing.  But since their size made them perfect for use in
high school classes, we read a lot of them, which gave us the
impression the short story was flourishing.  Mistake number three.
And because they were so short, nothing really had to happen; you
could just show a randomly truncated slice of life, and that was
considered advanced.  Mistake number four.  The result was that I
wrote a lot of stories in which nothing happened except that someone
was unhappy in a way that seemed deep.<br><br>For most of college I was a philosophy major.  I was very impressed
by the papers published in philosophy journals.  They were so
beautifully typeset, and their tone was just captivating—alternately
casual and buffer-overflowingly technical.  A fellow would be walking
along a street and suddenly modality qua modality would spring upon
him.  I didn't ever quite understand these papers, but I figured
I'd get around to that later, when I had time to reread them more
closely.  In the meantime I tried my best to imitate them.  This
was, I can now see, a doomed undertaking, because they weren't
really saying anything.  No philosopher ever refuted another, for
example, because no one said anything definite enough to refute.
Needless to say, my imitations didn't say anything either.<br><br>In grad school I was still wasting time imitating the wrong things.
There was then a fashionable type of program called an expert system,
at the core of which was something called an inference engine.  I
looked at what these things did and thought "I could write that in
a thousand lines of code."  And yet eminent professors were writing
books about them, and startups were selling them for a year's salary
a copy.  What an opportunity, I thought; these impressive things
seem easy to me; I must be pretty sharp.  Wrong.  It was simply a
fad.  The books the professors wrote about expert systems are now
ignored.  They were not even on a <i>path</i> to anything interesting.
And the customers paying so much for them were largely the same
government agencies that paid thousands for screwdrivers and toilet
seats.<br><br>How do you avoid copying the wrong things?  Copy only what you
genuinely like.  That would have saved me in all three cases.  I
didn't enjoy the short stories we had to read in English classes;
I didn't learn anything from philosophy papers; I didn't use expert
systems myself.  I believed these things were good because they
were admired.<br><br>It can be hard to separate the things you like from the things
you're impressed with.  One trick is to ignore presentation.  Whenever
I see a painting impressively hung in a museum, I ask myself: how
much would I pay for this if I found it at a garage sale, dirty and
frameless, and with no idea who painted it?  If you walk around a
museum trying this experiment, you'll find you get some truly
startling results.  Don't ignore this data point just because it's
an outlier.<br><br>Another way to figure out what you like is to look at what you enjoy
as guilty pleasures.  Many things people like, especially if they're
young and ambitious, they like largely for the feeling of virtue
in liking them.  99% of people reading <i>Ulysses</i> are thinking
"I'm reading <i>Ulysses</i>" as they do it. A guilty pleasure is
at least a pure one.  What do you read when you don't feel up to being
virtuous?  What kind of book do you read and feel sad that there's
only half of it left, instead of being impressed that you're half
way through?  That's what you really like.<br><br>Even when you find genuinely good things to copy, there's another
pitfall to be avoided.  Be careful to copy what makes them good,
rather than their flaws.  It's easy to be drawn into imitating
flaws, because they're easier to see, and of course easier to copy
too.  For example, most painters in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries used brownish colors.  They were imitating the great
painters of the Renaissance, whose paintings by that time were brown
with dirt.  Those paintings have since been cleaned, revealing
brilliant colors; their imitators are of course still brown.<br><br>It was painting, incidentally, that cured me of copying the wrong
things.  Halfway through grad school I decided I wanted to try being
a painter, and the art world was so manifestly corrupt that it
snapped the leash of credulity.  These people made philosophy
professors seem as scrupulous as mathematicians.  It was so clearly
a choice of doing good work xor being an insider that I was forced
to see the distinction.  It's there to some degree in almost every
field, but I had till then managed to avoid facing it.<br><br>That was one of the most valuable things I learned from painting:
you have to figure out for yourself what's 
<a href="taste.html">good</a>.  You can't trust
authorities. They'll lie to you on this one.<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="http://reddit.com"><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/0f994f8dada972cb7d444e80cdecbc7d.png" border="0"></a>

August 2006, rev. April 2007, September 2010<br><br>In a few days it will be Demo Day, when the startups we funded
this summer present to investors.  Y Combinator funds startups twice
a year, in January and June.  Ten weeks later we invite all the
investors we know to hear them present what they've built so far.<br><br>Ten weeks is not much time.  The average startup probably doesn't
have much to show for itself after ten weeks.  But the average
startup fails.  When you look at the ones that went on to do great
things, you find a lot that began with someone pounding out a
prototype in a week or two of nonstop work.  Startups are a
counterexample to the rule that haste makes waste.<br><br>(Too much money seems to be as bad for startups as too much time,
so we don't give them much money either.)<br><br>A week before Demo Day, we have a dress rehearsal called Rehearsal Day.
At other Y Combinator events we allow outside guests, but not at
Rehearsal Day.  No one except the other founders gets to see the rehearsals.<br><br>The presentations on Rehearsal Day are often pretty rough.  But this is
to be expected.  We try to pick founders who are good at building
things, not ones who are slick presenters.  Some of the founders
are just out of college, or even still in it, and have never spoken
to a group of people they didn't already know.<br><br>So we concentrate on the basics.  On Demo Day each startup will
only get ten minutes, so we encourage them to focus on just two
goals: (a) explain what you're doing, and (b) explain why users
will want it.<br><br>That might sound easy, but it's not when the speakers have no
experience presenting, and they're explaining technical matters to
an audience that's mostly non-technical.<br><br>This situation is constantly repeated when startups present to
investors: people who are bad at explaining, talking to people who
are bad at understanding.  Practically every successful startup,
including stars like Google, presented at some point to investors
who didn't get it and turned them down.  Was it because the founders
were bad at presenting, or because the investors were obtuse?  It's
probably always some of both.<br><br>At the most recent Rehearsal Day, we four Y Combinator partners found
ourselves saying a lot of the same things we said at the last two.
So at dinner afterward we collected all our tips about presenting
to investors.  Most startups face similar challenges, so we hope
these will be useful to a wider audience.<br><br>
<b>1. Explain what you're doing.</b><br><br>Investors' main question when judging a very early startup is whether
you've made a compelling product.  Before they can judge whether
you've built a good x, they have to understand what kind of x you've
built.  They will get very frustrated if instead of telling them
what you do, you make them sit through some kind of preamble.<br><br>Say what you're doing as soon as possible, preferably in the first
sentence. "We're Jeff and Bob and we've built an easy to use web-based
database.  Now we'll show it to you and explain why people need
this."<br><br>If you're a great public speaker you may be able to violate this
rule.  Last year one founder spent the whole first half of his talk
on a fascinating analysis of the limits of the conventional desktop
metaphor.  He got away with it, but unless you're a captivating
speaker, which most hackers aren't, it's better to play it safe.<br><br><b>2. Get rapidly to demo.</b><br><br><i>This section is now obsolete for YC founders presenting
at Demo Day, because Demo Day presentations are now so short
that they rarely include much if any demo.  They seem to work
just as well without, however, which makes me think I was
wrong to emphasize demos so much before.</i><br><br>A demo explains what you've made more effectively than any verbal
description.  The only thing worth talking about first is the problem
you're trying to solve and why it's important.  But don't spend
more than a tenth of your time on that.  Then demo.<br><br>When you demo, don't run through a catalog of features.  Instead
start with the problem you're solving, and then show how your product
solves it.  Show features in an order driven by some kind of purpose,
rather than the order in which they happen to appear on the screen.<br><br>If you're demoing something web-based, assume that the network
connection will mysteriously die 30 seconds into your presentation,
and come prepared with a copy of the server software running on
your laptop.<br><br><b>3. Better a narrow description than a vague one.</b><br><br>One reason founders resist describing their projects concisely is
that, at this early stage, there are all kinds of possibilities.
The most concise descriptions seem misleadingly narrow.  So for
example a group that has built an easy web-based database might
resist calling their applicaton that, because it could be so much
more.  In fact, it could be anything...<br><br>The problem is, as you approach (in the calculus sense) a description
of something that could be anything, the content of your description
approaches zero.  If you describe your web-based database as "a
system to allow people to collaboratively leverage the value of
information," it will go in one investor ear and out the other.
They'll just discard that sentence as meaningless boilerplate, and
hope, with increasing impatience, that in the next sentence you'll
actually explain what you've made.<br><br>Your primary goal is not to describe everything your system might
one day become, but simply to convince investors you're worth talking
to further.  So approach this like an algorithm that gets the right
answer by successive approximations.  Begin with a description
that's gripping but perhaps overly narrow, then flesh it out to the
extent you can.  It's the same principle as incremental development:
start with a simple prototype, then add features, but at every point
have working code.  In this case, "working code" means a working
description in the investor's head.<br><br><b>4. Don't talk and drive.</b><br><br>Have one person talk while another uses the computer.  If the same
person does both, they'll inevitably mumble downwards at the computer
screen instead of talking clearly at the audience.<br><br>As long as you're standing near the audience and looking at them,
politeness (and habit) compel them to pay attention to you.  Once
you stop looking at them to fuss with something on your computer,
their minds drift off to the errands they have to run later.<br><br><b>5. Don't talk about secondary matters at length.</b><br><br>If you only have a few minutes, spend them explaining what your
product does and why it's great.  Second order issues like competitors
or resumes should be single slides you go through quickly at the
end.  If you have impressive resumes, just flash them on the screen
for 15 seconds and say a few words.  For competitors, list the top
3 and explain in one sentence each what they lack
that you have.  And put this kind of thing at the end, after you've
made it clear what you've built.<br><br><b>6. Don't get too deeply into business models.</b><br><br>It's good to talk about how you plan to make money, but mainly
because it shows you care about that and have thought about it.
Don't go into detail about your business model, because (a) that's
not what smart investors care about in a brief presentation, and
(b) any business model you have at this point is probably wrong
anyway.<br><br>Recently a VC who came to speak at Y Combinator talked about a
company he just invested in.  He said their business model was wrong
and would probably change three times before they got it right.
The founders were experienced guys who'd done startups before and
who'd just succeeded in getting millions from one of the top VC
firms, and even their business model was crap.  (And yet he invested
anyway, because he expected it to be crap at this stage.)<br><br>If you're solving an important problem, you're going to sound a lot
smarter talking about that than the business model.  The business
model is just a bunch of guesses, and guesses about stuff that's
probably not your area of expertise.  So don't spend your precious
few minutes talking about crap when you could be talking about
solid, interesting things you know a lot about: the problem you're
solving and what you've built so far.<br><br>As well as being a bad use of time, if your business model seems
spectacularly wrong, that will push the stuff you want investors
to remember out of their heads.  They'll just remember you as the
company with the boneheaded plan for making money, rather than the
company that solved that important problem.<br><br><b>7. Talk slowly and clearly at the audience.</b><br><br>Everyone at Rehearsal Day could see the difference between the people
who'd been out in the world for a while and had presented to groups,
and those who hadn't.<br><br>You need to use a completely different voice and manner talking to
a roomful of people than you would in conversation.  Everyday life
gives you no practice in this.  If you can't already do it, the
best solution is to treat it as a consciously artificial trick,
like juggling.<br><br>However, that doesn't mean you should talk like some kind of
announcer.  Audiences tune that out.  What you need to do is talk
in this artificial way, and yet make it seem conversational.  (Writing
is the same.  Good writing is an elaborate effort to seem spontaneous.)<br><br>If you want to write out your whole presentation beforehand and
memorize it, that's ok.  That has worked for some groups in the
past.  But make sure to write something that sounds like spontaneous,
informal speech, and deliver it that way too.<br><br>Err on the side of speaking slowly.  At Rehearsal Day, one of the founders
mentioned a rule actors use: if you feel you're speaking too slowly,
you're speaking at about the right speed.<br><br><b>8. Have one person talk.</b><br><br>Startups often want to show that all the founders are equal partners.
This is a good instinct; investors dislike unbalanced teams.  But
trying to show it by partitioning the presentation is going too
far.  It's distracting.  You can demonstrate your respect
for one another in more subtle ways.  For example, when one of the
groups presented at Demo Day, the more extroverted of the two
founders did most of the talking, but he described his co-founder
as the best hacker he'd ever met, and you could tell he meant it.<br><br>Pick the one or at most two best speakers, and have them do most
of the talking.<br><br>Exception: If one of the founders is an expert in some specific
technical field, it can be good for them to talk about that for a
minute or so.  This kind of "expert witness" can add credibility,
even if the audience doesn't understand all the details.  If Jobs
and Wozniak had 10 minutes to present the Apple II, it might be a good plan
to have Jobs speak for 9 minutes and have Woz speak for a minute
in the middle about some of the technical feats he'd pulled off in
the design.  (Though of course if it were actually those two, Jobs
would speak for the entire 10 minutes.)<br><br><b>9. Seem confident.</b><br><br>Between the brief time available and their lack of technical
background, many in the audience will have a hard time evaluating
what you're doing.  Probably the single biggest piece of evidence,
initially, will be your own confidence in it.   You have
to show you're impressed with what you've made.<br><br>And I mean show, not tell.  Never say "we're passionate" or "our
product is great."  People just ignore that—or worse, write you
off as bullshitters.  Such messages must be implicit.<br><br>What you must not do is seem nervous and apologetic.  If you've
truly made something good, you're doing investors a <i>favor</i> by
telling them about it.  If you don't genuinely believe that, perhaps
you ought to change what your company is doing.  If you don't believe
your startup has such promise that you'd be doing them a favor by
letting them invest, why are you investing your time in it?<br><br><b>10. Don't try to seem more than you are.</b><br><br>Don't worry if your company is just a few months old and doesn't
have an office yet, or your founders are technical people with no
business experience.  Google was like that once, and they turned out
ok.  Smart investors can see past such superficial flaws.  They're
not looking for finished, smooth presentations.  They're looking
for raw talent.  All you need to convince them of is that you're
smart and that you're onto something good.  If you try too hard to
conceal your rawness—by trying to seem corporate, or pretending
to know about stuff you don't—you may just conceal your talent.<br><br>You can afford to be candid about what you haven't figured out yet.
Don't go out of your way to bring it up (e.g. by having a slide
about what might go wrong), but don't try to pretend either that
you're further along than you are.  If you're a hacker and you're
presenting to experienced investors, they're probably better at
detecting bullshit than you are at producing it.<br><br><b>11. Don't put too many words on slides.</b><br><br>When there are a lot of words on a slide, people just skip reading
it.  So look at your slides and ask of each word "could I cross
this out?"  This includes gratuitous clip art.  Try to get your
slides under 20 words if you can.<br><br>Don't read your slides.  They should be something in the background
as you face the audience and talk to them, not something you face
and read to an audience sitting behind you.<br><br>Cluttered sites don't do well in demos, especially when they're
projected onto a screen.  At the very least, crank up the font size
big enough to make all the text legible.  But cluttered sites are
bad anyway, so perhaps you should use this opportunity to make your
design simpler.<br><br><b>12. Specific numbers are good.</b><br><br>If you have any kind of data, however preliminary, tell the audience.
Numbers stick in people's heads.  If you can claim that the median
visitor generates 12 page views, that's great.<br><br>But don't give them more than four or five numbers, and only give
them numbers specific to you.  You don't need to tell them the size
of the market you're in.  Who cares, really, if it's 500 million
or 5 billion a year?  Talking about that is like an actor at the
beginning of his career telling his parents how much Tom Hanks
makes.  Yeah, sure, but first you have to become Tom Hanks.  The
important part is not whether he makes ten million a year or a
hundred, but how you get there.<br><br><b>13. Tell stories about users.</b><br><br>The biggest fear of investors looking at early stage startups is
that you've built something based on your own a priori theories of
what the world needs, but that no one will actually want.  So it's
good if you can talk about problems specific users have and how you
solve them.<br><br>Greg Mcadoo said one thing Sequoia looks for is the "proxy for
demand."  What are people doing now, using inadequate tools, that
shows they need what you're making?<br><br>Another sign of user need is when people pay a lot for something.
It's easy to convince investors there will be demand for
a cheaper alternative to something popular, if you preserve
the qualities that made it popular.<br><br>The best stories about user needs are about your own.  A remarkable
number of famous startups grew out of some need the founders had:
Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Google.  Experienced investors know that,
so stories of this type will get their attention.  The next best
thing is to talk about the needs of people you know personally,
like your friends or siblings.<br><br><b>14. Make a soundbite stick in their heads.</b><br><br>Professional investors hear a lot of pitches.  After a while they
all blur together.  The first cut is simply to be one of those
they remember.  And the way to ensure that is to create a descriptive
phrase about yourself that sticks in their heads.<br><br>In Hollywood, these phrases seem to be of the form "x meets y."
<!-- "Brokeback Mountain meets Godzilla."  [Pauses to contemplate this.] -->
In the startup world, they're usually "the x of y" or "the x y."
Viaweb's was "the Microsoft Word of ecommerce."<br><br>Find one and launch it clearly (but apparently casually) in your
talk, preferably near the beginning.<br><br>It's a good exercise for you, too, to sit down and try to figure
out how to describe your startup in one compelling phrase.  If you
can't, your plans may not be sufficiently focused.<br><br><br clear="all"></p></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><a href="startupfunding.html">How to Fund a Startup</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><a href="guidetoinvestors.html">Hackers' Guide to Investors</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><a href="http://www.simpleoption.com/ensayo-como-presentarte-inversores.html">Spanish Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/lionfan/20070130">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><a href="http://www.perevedem.ru/article/investors.htm">Russian Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><br><br>

<p>
October 2006<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at MIT.)</i><br><br>Till recently graduating seniors had two choices: get a job or go
to grad school.  I think there will increasingly be a third option:
to start your own startup.  But how common will that be?<br><br>I'm sure the default will always be to get a job, but starting a
startup could well become as popular as grad school.  In the late
90s my professor friends used to complain that they couldn't get
grad students, because all the undergrads were going to work for
startups.  I wouldn't be surprised if that situation returns, but
with one difference: this time they'll be starting their own
instead of going to work for other people's.<br><br>The most ambitious students will at this point be asking: Why wait
till you graduate?  Why not start a startup while you're in college?
In fact, why go to college at all?  Why not start a startup instead?<br><br>A year and a half ago I gave a <a href="hiring.html">talk</a> 
where I said that the average age of the founders of
Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft was 24, and that if grad students could
start startups, why not undergrads?  I'm glad I phrased that as a
question, because now I can pretend it wasn't merely a rhetorical
one.  At the time I couldn't imagine why there should be any lower
limit for the age of startup founders.  Graduation is a bureaucratic
change, not a biological one.  And certainly there are undergrads
as competent technically as most grad students.  So why shouldn't
undergrads be able to start startups as well as grad students?<br><br>I now realize that something does change at graduation: you lose a
huge excuse for failing.  Regardless of how complex your life is,
you'll find that everyone else, including your family and friends,
will discard all the low bits and regard you as having a single
occupation at any given time.  If you're in college and have a
summer job writing software, you still read as a student.  Whereas
if you graduate and get a job programming, you'll be instantly
regarded by everyone as a programmer.<br><br>The problem with starting a startup while you're still in school
is that there's a built-in escape hatch.  If you start a startup
in the summer between your junior and senior year, it reads to
everyone as a summer job.
So if it goes nowhere, big deal; you return to school in the
fall with all the other seniors; no one regards you as a failure,
because your occupation is student, and you didn't fail at that.
Whereas if you start a startup just one year later, after you
graduate, as long as you're not accepted to grad school in the fall
the startup reads to everyone as your occupation.  You're
now a startup founder, so you have to do well at that.<br><br>For nearly everyone, the opinion of one's peers is the most powerful
motivator of all—more powerful even than the nominal goal of most
startup founders, getting rich.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font>
About a month into each funding
cycle we have an event called Prototype Day where each startup
presents to the others what they've got so far.  You might think
they wouldn't need any more motivation.  They're working on their
cool new idea; they have funding for the immediate future; and
they're playing a game with only two outcomes: wealth or failure.
You'd think that would be motivation enough.  And yet the prospect
of a demo pushes most of them into a
rush of activity.<br><br>Even if you start a startup explicitly to get rich, the money you
might get seems pretty theoretical most of the time.  What drives
you day to day is not wanting to look bad.<br><br>You probably can't change that.  Even if you could, I don't think
you'd want to; someone who really, truly doesn't care what his peers
think of him is probably a psychopath.  So the best you can do is
consider this force like a wind, and set up your boat accordingly.
If you know your peers are going to push you in some direction,
choose good peers, and position yourself so they push you in a
direction you like.<br><br>Graduation changes the prevailing winds, and those make a difference.
Starting a startup is so hard
that it's a close call even for the ones that succeed.  However
high a startup may be flying now, it probably has a few leaves stuck
in the landing gear from those trees it barely cleared at the end
of the runway.  In such a close game, the smallest increase in the
forces against you can be enough to flick you over the edge into
failure.<br><br>When we first started <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> 
we encouraged people to start
startups while they were still in college.  That's partly because
Y Combinator began as a kind of summer program.  We've kept the
program shape—all of us having dinner together once a week turns
out to be a good idea—but we've decided now
that the party line should be to tell people to wait till they
graduate.<br><br>Does that mean you can't start a startup in college?  Not at all.
Sam Altman, the co-founder of <a href="http://loopt.com">Loopt</a>,
had just finished his sophomore year when we funded them, and Loopt
is probably the most promising of all the startups we've funded so
far.  But Sam Altman is a very unusual guy.  Within about three
minutes of meeting him, I remember thinking "Ah, so this is what
Bill Gates must have been like when he was 19."<br><br>If it can work to start a startup during college, why do
we tell people not to?  For the same reason that the probably
apocryphal violinist, whenever he was asked to judge someone's
playing, would always say they didn't have enough talent to make
it as a pro.  Succeeding as a musician takes determination as well
as talent, so this answer works out to be the right advice for
everyone.  The ones who are uncertain believe it and give up, and
the ones who are sufficiently determined think "screw that, I'll
succeed anyway."<br><br>So our official policy now is only to fund undergrads we can't talk
out of it.  And frankly, if you're not certain, you <i>should</i> wait.
It's not as if all the opportunities to start companies are going
to be gone if you don't do it now.  Maybe the window will close on
some idea you're working on, but that won't be the last idea you'll
have.  For every idea that times out, new ones become feasible.
Historically the opportunities to start startups have only increased
with time.<br><br>In that case, you might ask, why not wait longer?  Why not go work
for a while, or go to grad school, and then start a startup?  And
indeed, that might be a good idea.  If I had to pick the sweet spot
for startup founders, based on who we're most excited to see
applications from, I'd say it's probably the mid-twenties.  Why?
What advantages does someone in their mid-twenties have over someone
who's 21?  And why isn't it older?  What can 25 year olds do that
32 year olds can't?  Those turn out to be questions worth examining.<br><br><b>Plus</b><br><br>If you start a startup soon after college, you'll be a young founder
by present standards, so you should know what the relative advantages
of young founders are.  They're not what you might think.  As a
young founder your strengths are: stamina, poverty, rootlessness,
colleagues, and ignorance.<br><br>The importance of stamina shouldn't be surprising.  If you've heard
anything about startups you've probably heard about the long hours.
As far as I can tell these are universal.  I can't think of any
successful startups whose founders worked 9 to 5.  And it's
particularly necessary for younger founders to work long hours
because they're probably not as efficient as they'll be later.<br><br>Your second advantage, poverty, might not sound like an advantage,
but it is a huge one.  Poverty implies you can live cheaply,
and this is critically important for startups.  Nearly every startup
that fails, fails by running out of money.  It's a little misleading
to put it this way, because there's usually some other underlying
cause.  But regardless of the source of your problems, a low burn
rate gives you more opportunity to recover from them.  And since
most startups make all kinds of mistakes at first, room to recover
from mistakes is a valuable thing to have.<br><br>Most startups end up doing something different than they planned.
The way the successful ones find something that works is by trying
things that don't.  So the worst thing you can do in a startup is
to have a rigid, pre-ordained plan and then start spending a lot
of money to implement it.  Better to operate cheaply and give your
ideas time to evolve.<br><br>Recent grads can live on practically nothing, and this gives you
an edge over older founders, because the main cost in software
startups is people.  The guys with kids and mortgages are at a
real disadvantage.  This is one reason I'd bet on the 25 year old
over the 32 year old.  The 32 year old probably is a better programmer,
but probably also has a much more expensive life.  Whereas a 25
year old has some work experience (more on that later) but can live
as cheaply as an undergrad.<br><br>Robert Morris and I were 29 and 30 respectively when we started
Viaweb, but fortunately we still lived like 23 year olds.  We both had
roughly zero assets.  I would have loved to have a mortgage,
since that would have meant I had a <i>house</i>.  But in retrospect
having nothing turned out to be convenient. I wasn't tied down and
I was used to living cheaply.<br><br>Even more important than living cheaply, though, is thinking cheaply.
One reason the Apple II was so popular was that it was cheap.  The
computer itself was cheap, and it used cheap, off-the-shelf peripherals
like a cassette tape recorder for data storage and a TV as a monitor.
And you know why?  Because Woz designed this computer for himself,
and he couldn't afford anything more.<br><br>We benefitted from the same phenomenon.  Our prices were
daringly low for the time.  The top level of service was
$300 a month, which was an order of magnitude below the norm.  In
retrospect this was a smart move, but we didn't do it because we
were smart.  $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.  Like
Apple, we created something inexpensive, and therefore popular,
simply because we were poor.<br><br>A lot of startups have that form: someone comes along and makes
something for a tenth or a hundredth of what it used to cost, and
the existing players can't follow because they don't even want to
think about a world in which that's possible.  Traditional long
distance carriers, for example, didn't even want to think about
VoIP.  (It was coming, all the same.)  Being poor helps in this
game, because your own personal bias points in the same direction
technology evolves in.<br><br>The advantages of rootlessness are similar to those of poverty.
When you're young you're more mobile—not just because you don't
have a house or much stuff, but also because you're less likely to
have serious relationships.  This turns out to be important, because
a lot of startups involve someone moving.<br><br>The founders of Kiko, for example, are now en route to the Bay Area
to start their next startup.  It's a better place for what they
want to do.  And it was easy for them to decide to go, because
neither as far as I know has a serious girlfriend, and everything
they own will fit in one car—or more precisely, will either fit
in one car or is crappy enough that they don't mind leaving it
behind.<br><br>They at least were in Boston.  What if they'd been in Nebraska,
like Evan Williams was at their age?   Someone wrote recently that
the drawback of Y Combinator was that you had to move to participate.
It couldn't be any other way. The kind of conversations we have
with founders, we have to have in person.  We fund a dozen startups
at a time, and we can't be in a dozen places at once.  But even if
we could somehow magically save people from moving, we wouldn't.
We wouldn't be doing founders a favor by letting them stay in
Nebraska.  Places that aren't 
<a href="siliconvalley.html">startup hubs</a> are toxic to startups.
You can tell that from indirect evidence.  You can tell how hard
it must be to start a startup in Houston or Chicago or Miami from
the microscopically small number, per capita, that succeed 
there.  I don't know exactly what's suppressing all the startups in these
towns—probably a hundred subtle little things—but something
must be.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Maybe this will change.  Maybe the increasing cheapness of startups
will mean they'll be able to survive anywhere, instead of only in
the most hospitable environments.  Maybe 37signals is the pattern
for the future.  But maybe not.  Historically there have always
been certain towns that were centers for certain industries, and
if you weren't in one of them you were at a disadvantage.  So my
guess is that 37signals is an anomaly.  We're looking at a pattern
much older than "Web 2.0" here.<br><br>Perhaps the reason more startups per capita happen in the Bay Area
than Miami is simply that there are more founder-type people there.
Successful startups are almost never started by one person.  Usually
they begin with a conversation in which someone mentions that
something would be a good idea for a company, and his friend says,
"Yeah, that is a good idea, let's try it."  If you're missing that
second person who says "let's try it," the startup never happens.
And that is another area where undergrads have an edge.  They're
surrounded by people willing to say that.  At a good college you're
concentrated together with a lot of other ambitious and technically
minded people—probably more concentrated than you'll ever be
again.  If your nucleus spits out a neutron, there's a good chance
it will hit another nucleus.<br><br>The number one question people ask us at Y Combinator is: Where can
I find a co-founder?  That's the biggest problem for someone starting
a startup at 30.  When they were in school they knew a lot of good
co-founders, but by 30 they've either lost touch with them or these
people are tied down by jobs they don't want to leave.<br><br>Viaweb was an anomaly in this respect too.  Though we were comparatively
old, we weren't tied down by impressive jobs.  I was trying to be
an artist, which is not very constraining, and Robert, though 29,
was still in grad school due to a little interruption in his academic
career back in 1988.  So arguably the Worm made Viaweb possible.
Otherwise Robert would have been a junior professor at that age,
and he wouldn't have had time to work on crazy speculative projects
with me.<br><br>Most of the questions people ask Y Combinator we have some kind of
answer for, but not the co-founder question.  There is no good
answer.  Co-founders really should be people you already know.  And
by far the best place to meet them is school. You have a large
sample of smart people; you get to compare how they all perform on
identical tasks; and everyone's life is pretty fluid.  A lot of
startups grow out of schools for this reason.  Google, Yahoo, and
Microsoft, among others, were all founded by people who met in
school.  (In Microsoft's case, it was high school.)<br><br>Many students feel they should wait and get a little more experience
before they start a company.  All other things being equal, they
should.  But all other things are not quite as equal as they look.
Most students don't realize how rich they are in the scarcest
ingredient in startups, co-founders.  If you wait too long, you may
find that your friends are now involved in some project they don't
want to abandon.  The better they are, the more likely this is to
happen.<br><br>One way to mitigate this problem might be to actively plan your
startup while you're getting those n years of experience.  Sure,
go off and get jobs or go to grad school or whatever, but get
together regularly to scheme, so the idea of starting a startup
stays alive in everyone's brain.  I don't know if this works, but
it can't hurt to try.<br><br>It would be helpful just to realize what an advantage you have as
students.  Some of your classmates are probably going to be successful
startup founders; at a great technical university, that is a near
certainty.  So which ones?  If I were you I'd look for the people
who are not just smart, but incurable 
<a href="http://my-computer.cruftlabs.com:8080/photos/motorcouch/0067.html">builders</a>.  <!-- It seems like the
best founders are the people who can't stop making things.  So l-->
Look
for the people who keep starting projects, and finish at least some
of them.  That's what we look for.  Above all else, above academic
credentials and even the idea you apply with, we look for people
who build things.<br><br>The other place co-founders meet is at work.  Fewer do than at
school, but there are things you can do to improve the odds.  The
most important, obviously, is to work somewhere that has a lot of
smart, young people.  Another is to work for a company located in
a startup hub.  It will be easier to talk a co-worker into quitting
with you in a place where startups are happening all around you.<br><br>You might also want to look at the employment agreement you sign
when you get hired.  Most will say that any ideas you think of while
you're employed by the company belong to them.  In practice it's
hard for anyone to prove what ideas you had when, so the line gets
drawn at code.  If you're going to start a startup, don't write any
of the code while you're still employed.  Or at least discard any
code you wrote while still employed and start over.  It's not so
much that your employer will find out and sue you.  It won't come
to that; investors or acquirers or (if you're so lucky) underwriters
will nail you first.  Between t = 0 and when you buy that yacht,
<i>someone</i> is going to ask if any of your code legally belongs
to anyone else, and you need to be able to say no.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The most overreaching employee agreement I've seen so far is Amazon's.
In addition to the usual clauses about owning your ideas, you also
can't be a founder of a startup that has another founder who worked
at Amazon—even if you didn't know them or even work there at the
same time. I suspect they'd have a hard time enforcing this, but
it's a bad sign they even try.  There are plenty of other places
to work; you may as well choose one that keeps more of your options
open.<br><br>Speaking of cool places to work, there is of course Google.  But I
notice something slightly frightening about Google: zero startups
come out of there.  In that respect it's a black hole.  People seem
to like working at Google too much to leave.  So if you hope to start
a startup one day, the evidence so far suggests you shouldn't work
there.<br><br>I realize this seems odd advice.  If they make your life so good
that you don't want to leave, why not work there?  Because, in
effect, you're probably getting a local maximum.  You need a certain
activation energy to start a startup.  So an employer who's fairly
pleasant to work for can lull you into staying indefinitely, even
if it would be a net win for you to leave.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>The best place to work, if you want to start a startup, is probably
a startup.  In addition to being the right sort of experience, one
way or another it will be over quickly.  You'll either end up rich,
in which case problem solved, or the startup will get bought, in
which case it it will start to suck to work there and it will be
easy to leave, or most likely, the thing will blow up and you'll
be free again.<br><br>Your final advantage, ignorance, may not sound very useful.  I
deliberately used a controversial word for it; you might equally
call it innocence.  But it seems to be a powerful force.  My Y
Combinator co-founder Jessica Livingston is just about to publish
a book of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597141">interviews</a>
with startup founders, and I noticed a remarkable pattern in them.
One after another said that if they'd known how hard it would be,
they would have been too intimidated to start.<br><br>Ignorance can be useful when it's a counterweight to other forms
of stupidity.  It's useful in starting startups because you're
capable of more than you realize.  Starting startups is harder than
you expect, but you're also capable of more than you expect, so
they balance out.<br><br>Most people look at a company like Apple and think, how could I
ever make such a thing?  Apple is an institution, and I'm just a
person.  But every institution was at one point just a handful of
people in a room deciding to start something.  Institutions are
made up, and made up by people no different from you.<br><br>I'm not saying everyone could start a startup.  I'm sure most people
couldn't; I don't know much about the population at large.  When
you get to groups I know well, like hackers, I can say more precisely.
At the top schools, I'd guess as many as a quarter of the CS majors
could make it as startup founders if they wanted.<br><br>That "if they wanted" is an important qualification—so important
that it's almost cheating to append it like that—because once you
get over a certain threshold of intelligence, which most CS majors
at top schools are past, the deciding factor in whether you succeed
as a founder is how much you want to.  You don't have to be that
smart.  If you're not a genius, just start a startup in some unsexy
field where you'll have less competition, like software for human
resources departments.  I picked that example at random, but I feel
safe in predicting that whatever they have now, it wouldn't take
genius to do better.   There are a lot of people out there working
on boring stuff who are desperately in need of better software, so
however short you think you fall of Larry and Sergey, you can ratchet
down the coolness of the idea far enough to compensate.<br><br>As well as preventing you from being intimidated, ignorance can
sometimes help you discover new ideas.  <a href="http://foundersatwork.com/stevewozniak.html">Steve Wozniak</a>
put this very strongly:
</p><blockquote>
  All the best things that I did at Apple came from (a) not having
  money and (b) not having done it before, ever. Every single thing
  that we came out with that was really great, I'd never once done
  that thing in my life.
</blockquote>
When you know nothing, you have to reinvent stuff for yourself, and
if you're smart your reinventions may be better than what preceded
them.  This is especially true in fields where the rules change.
All our ideas about software were developed in a time when processors
were slow, and memories and disks were tiny.  Who knows what obsolete
assumptions are embedded in the conventional wisdom?  And the way
these assumptions are going to get fixed is not by explicitly
deallocating them, but by something more akin to garbage collection.
Someone ignorant but smart will come along and reinvent everything,
and in the process simply fail to reproduce certain existing ideas.<br><br><b>Minus</b><br><br>So much for the advantages of young founders.  What about the
disadvantages? I'm going to start with what goes wrong and try to
trace it back to the root causes.<br><br>What goes wrong with young founders is that they build stuff that
looks like class projects.  It was only recently that we figured
this out ourselves.  We noticed a lot of similarities between the
startups that seemed to be falling behind, but we couldn't figure
out how to put it into words.  Then finally we realized what it
was: they were building class projects.<br><br>But what does that really mean?  What's wrong with class projects?
What's the difference between a class project and a real startup?
If we could answer that question it would be useful not just to
would-be startup founders but to students in general, because we'd
be a long way toward explaining the mystery of the so-called real
world.<br><br>There seem to be two big things missing in class projects: (1) an
iterative definition of a real problem and (2) intensity.<br><br>The first is probably unavoidable.  Class projects will inevitably
solve fake problems.  For one thing, real problems are rare and
valuable.  If a professor wanted to have students solve real problems,
he'd face the same paradox as someone trying to give an example of
whatever "paradigm" might succeed the Standard Model of physics.
There may well be something that does, but if you could think of
an example you'd be entitled to the Nobel Prize.  Similarly, good
new problems are not to be had for the asking.<br><br>In technology the difficulty is compounded by the fact that real
startups tend to discover the problem they're solving by a process
of evolution.  Someone has an idea for something; they build it;
and in doing so (and probably only by doing so) they realize
the problem they should be solving is another one.  Even if the
professor let you change your project description on the fly, there
isn't time enough to do that in a college class, or a market to
supply evolutionary pressures.  So class
projects are mostly about implementation, which is the least
of your problems in a startup.<br><br>It's not just that in a startup you work on the idea as well as
implementation.  The very implementation is different.  Its main
purpose is to refine the idea.  Often the only value of most of the
stuff you build in the first six months is that it proves your
initial idea was mistaken.  And that's extremely valuable.  If
you're free of a misconception that everyone else still shares,
you're in a powerful position.  But you're not thinking that way
about a class project.  Proving your initial plan was mistaken would
just get you a bad grade.  Instead of building stuff to throw away,
you tend to want every line of code to go toward that final goal
of showing you did a lot of work.<br><br>That leads to our second difference: the way class projects are
measured.  Professors will tend to judge you by the distance between
the starting point and where you are now.  If someone has achieved
a lot, they should get a good grade.  But customers will judge you
from the other direction: the distance remaining between where you
are now and the features they need.  The market doesn't give a shit
how hard you worked.  Users just want your software to do what they
need, and you get a zero otherwise.  That is one of the most
distinctive differences between school and the real world: there
is no reward for putting in a good effort.  In fact, the whole
concept of a "good effort" is a fake idea adults invented to encourage
kids.  It is not found in nature.<br><br>Such lies seem to be helpful to kids.  But unfortunately when you
graduate they don't give you a list of all the lies they told you
during your education.  You have to get them beaten out of you by
contact with the real world.  And this is why so many jobs want
work experience.  I couldn't understand that when I was in college.
I knew how to program.  In fact, I could tell I knew how to program
better than most people doing it for a living.  So what was this
mysterious "work experience" and why did I need it?<br><br>Now I know what it is, and part of the confusion is grammatical.
Describing it as "work experience" implies it's like experience
operating a certain kind of machine, or using a certain programming
language.  But really what work experience refers to is not some
specific expertise, but the elimination of certain habits left over
from childhood.<br><br>One of the defining qualities of kids is that they flake.  When
you're a kid and you face some hard test, you can cry and say "I
can't" and they won't make you do it.  Of course, no one can make
you do anything in the grownup world either.  What they do instead
is fire you.  And when motivated by that
you find you can do a lot more than you realized.  So one of the
things employers expect from someone with "work experience" is the
elimination of the flake reflex—the ability to get things done,
with no excuses.<br><br>The other thing you get from work experience is an understanding
of what work is, and in particular, how intrinsically horrible it
is.  Fundamentally the equation is a brutal one: you have to spend
most of your waking hours doing stuff someone else wants, or starve.
There are a few places where the work is so interesting that this
is concealed, because what other people want done happens to coincide
with what you want to work on.  But you only have to imagine what
would happen if they diverged to see the underlying reality.<br><br>It's not so much that adults lie to kids about this as never explain
it.  They never explain what the deal is with money.  You know from
an early age that you'll have some sort of job, because everyone
asks what you're going to "be" when you grow up. What they
don't tell you is that as a kid you're sitting on the shoulders of
someone else who's treading water, and that starting working means
you get thrown into the water on your own, and have to start treading
water yourself or sink.  "Being" something is incidental; the
immediate problem is not to drown.<br><br>The relationship between work and money tends to dawn on you only
gradually.  At least it did for me.  One's first thought tends to
be simply "This sucks.  I'm in debt. Plus I have to get up on monday
and go to work."  Gradually you realize that these two things are
as tightly connected as only a market can make them.<br><br>So the most important advantage 24 year old founders have over 20
year old founders is that they know what they're trying to avoid.
To the average undergrad the idea of getting rich translates into
buying Ferraris, or being admired.  To someone who has learned from
experience about the relationship between money and work, it
translates to something way more important: it means you get to opt
out of the brutal equation that governs the lives of 99.9% of people.
Getting rich means you can stop treading water.<br><br>Someone who gets this will work much harder at making a startup
succeed—with the proverbial energy of a drowning man, in fact.
But understanding the relationship between money and work also
changes the way you work.  You don't get money just for working,
but for doing things other people want.  Someone who's figured that
out will automatically focus more on the user.  And that cures the
other half of the class-project syndrome.  After you've been working
for a while, you yourself tend to measure what you've done the same
way the market does.<br><br>Of course, you don't have to spend years working to learn this
stuff.  If you're sufficiently perceptive you can grasp these things
while you're still in school.  Sam Altman did.  He must have, because
Loopt is no class project.  And as his example suggests, this can
be valuable knowledge.  At a minimum, if you get this stuff, you
already have most of what you gain from the "work experience"
employers consider so desirable.  But of course if you really get
it, you can use this information in a way that's more valuable to
you than that.<br><br><b>Now</b><br><br>So suppose you think you might start a startup at some point, either
when you graduate or a few years after.  What should you do now?
For both jobs and grad school, there are ways to prepare while
you're in college.  If you want to get a job when you graduate, you
should get summer jobs at places you'd like to work.  If you want
to go to grad school, it will help to work on research projects as
an undergrad.  What's the equivalent for startups?  How do you keep
your options maximally open?<br><br>One thing you can do while you're still in school is to learn how
startups work.  Unfortunately that's not easy.  Few if any colleges
have classes about startups.  There may be business school classes
on entrepreneurship, as they call it over there, but these are
likely to be a waste of time.  Business schools like to talk about
startups, but philosophically they're at the opposite end of the
spectrum.  Most books on startups also seem to be useless.  I've
looked at a few and none get it right.  Books in most fields are
written by people who know the subject from experience, but for
startups there's a unique problem:  by definition the founders of
successful startups don't need to write books to make money. As a
result most books on the subject end up being written by people who
don't understand it.<br><br>So I'd be skeptical of classes and books.  The way to learn about
startups is by watching them in action, preferably by working at
one.  How do you do that as an undergrad?  Probably by sneaking in
through the back door. Just hang around a lot and gradually start
doing things for them.  Most startups are (or should be) very
cautious about hiring.  Every hire increases the burn rate, and bad
hires early on are hard to recover from.  However, startups usually
have a fairly informal atmosphere, and there's always a lot that
needs to be done.  If you just start doing stuff for them, many
will be too busy to shoo you away.  You can thus gradually work
your way into their confidence, and maybe turn it into an official
job later, or not, whichever you prefer.  This won't work for all
startups, but it would work for most I've known.<br><br>Number two, make the most of the great advantage of school: the
wealth of co-founders.  Look at the people around you and ask
yourself which you'd like to work with.  When you apply that test,
you may find you get surprising results.  You may find you'd prefer
the quiet guy you've mostly ignored to someone who seems impressive
but has an attitude to match.  I'm not suggesting you suck up to
people you don't really like because you think one day they'll be
successful.  Exactly the opposite, in fact: you should only start
a startup with someone you like, because a startup will put your
friendship through a stress test.  I'm just saying you should think
about who you really admire and hang out with them, instead of
whoever circumstances throw you together with.<br><br>Another thing you can do is learn skills that will be useful to you
in a startup.  These may be different from the skills you'd learn
to get a job.  For example, thinking about getting a job will make
you want to learn programming languages you think employers want,
like Java and C++.  Whereas if you start a startup, you get to pick
the language, so you have to think about which will actually let
you get the most done.  If you use that test you might end up
learning Ruby or Python instead.<br><br><!--More generally, you'll find that you have to start thinking about
being good instead of looking good.  That could be a liberating
idea for college students, most of whom, especially at the top
schools, have spent so long jumping through artificial hoops that
it has started to affect even the way they judge themselves.
Instead of focusing on getting good grades, for example, you'll
tend to focus on actually learning stuff.  In a startup your boss
is the customer, and they don't care what grades you got.  All they
care about is whether you can build stuff that works.
-->
But the most important skill for a startup founder isn't a programming
technique.  It's a knack for understanding users and figuring out
how to give them what they want.  I know I repeat this, but that's
because it's so important.  And it's a skill you can learn, though
perhaps habit might be a better word.  Get into the habit of thinking
of software as having users.  What do those users want?  What would
make them say wow?<br><br>This is particularly valuable for undergrads, because the concept
of users is missing from most college programming classes.  The way
you get taught programming in college would be like teaching writing
as grammar, without mentioning that its purpose is to communicate
something to an audience.  Fortunately an audience for software is
now only an http request away.  So in addition to the programming
you do for your classes, why not build some kind of website people
will find useful?  At the very least it will teach you how to write
software with users.  In the best case, it might not just be
preparation for a startup, but the startup itself, like it was for
Yahoo and Google.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]

<p>
October 2006<br><br>In the Q &amp; A period after a recent talk, someone asked what made
startups fail.  After standing there gaping for a few seconds I
realized this was kind of a trick question.  It's equivalent to
asking how to make a startup succeed — if you avoid every cause of
failure, you succeed — and that's too big a question to answer on
the fly.<br><br>Afterwards I realized it could be helpful to look at the problem
from this direction.  If you have a list of all the things you
shouldn't do, you can turn that into a recipe for succeeding just
by negating.  And this form of list may be more useful in practice.
It's easier to catch yourself doing something you shouldn't than
always to remember to do something you should.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>In a sense there's just one mistake that kills startups: not making
something users want.  If you make something users want, you'll
probably be fine, whatever else you do or don't do.  And if you
don't make something users want, then you're dead, whatever else
you do or don't do.  So really this is a list of 18 things that
cause startups not to make something users want.  Nearly all failure
funnels through that.<br><br><b>1. Single Founder</b><br><br>Have you ever noticed how few successful startups were founded by
just one person?  Even companies you think of as having one founder,
like Oracle, usually turn out to have more.  It seems unlikely this
is a coincidence.<br><br>What's wrong with having one founder?  To start with, it's a vote
of no confidence.  It probably means the founder couldn't talk any
of his friends into starting the company with him.  That's pretty
alarming, because his friends are the ones who know him best.<br><br>But even if the founder's friends were all wrong and the company
is a good bet, he's still at a disadvantage.  Starting a startup
is too hard for one person.  Even if you could do all the work
yourself, you need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you out
of stupid decisions, and to cheer you up when things go wrong.<br><br>The last one might be the most important.  The low points in a
startup are so low that few could bear them alone.  When you have
multiple founders, esprit de corps binds them together in a way
that seems to violate conservation laws.  Each thinks "I can't let
my friends down."  This is one of the most powerful forces in human
nature, and it's missing when there's just one founder.<br><br><b>2. Bad Location</b><br><br>Startups prosper in some places and not others.  Silicon Valley
dominates, then Boston, then Seattle, Austin, Denver, and New York.  After
that there's not much.  Even in New York the number of startups per
capita is probably a 20th of what it is in Silicon Valley.  In towns
like Houston and Chicago and Detroit it's too small to measure.<br><br>Why is the falloff so sharp?  Probably for the same reason it is
in other industries.  What's the sixth largest fashion center in
the US?  The sixth largest center for oil, or finance, or publishing?
Whatever they are they're probably so far from the top that it would
be misleading even to call them centers.<br><br>It's an interesting question why cities 
<a href="siliconvalley.html">become</a> startup hubs, but
the reason startups prosper in them is probably the same as it is
for any industry: that's where the experts are.  Standards are
higher; people are more sympathetic to what you're doing; the kind
of people you want to hire want to live there; supporting industries
are there; the people you run into in chance meetings are in the
same business.  Who knows exactly how these factors combine to boost
startups in Silicon Valley and squish them in Detroit, but it's
clear they do from the number of startups per capita in each.<br><br><b>3. Marginal Niche</b><br><br>Most of the groups that apply to Y Combinator suffer from a common
problem: choosing a small, obscure niche in the hope of avoiding
competition.<br><br>If you watch little kids playing sports, you notice that below a
certain age they're afraid of the ball.  When the ball comes near
them their instinct is to avoid it.  I didn't make a lot of catches
as an eight year old outfielder, because whenever a fly ball came
my way, I used to close my eyes and hold my glove up more for
protection than in the hope of catching it.<br><br>Choosing a marginal project is the startup equivalent of my eight
year old strategy for dealing with fly balls.  If you make anything
good, you're going to have competitors, so you may as well face
that.  You can only avoid competition by avoiding good ideas.<br><br>I think this shrinking from big problems is mostly unconscious.
It's not that people think of grand ideas but decide to pursue
smaller ones because they seem safer.  Your unconscious won't even
let you think of grand ideas.  So the solution may be to think about
ideas without involving yourself.  What would be a great idea for
<i>someone else</i> to do as a startup?<br><br><b>4. Derivative Idea</b><br><br>Many of the applications we get are imitations of some existing
company.  That's one source of ideas, but not the best.  If you
look at the origins of successful startups, few were started in
imitation of some other startup.  Where did they get their ideas?
Usually from some specific, unsolved problem the founders identified.<br><br>Our startup made software for making online stores.  When we started
it, there wasn't any; the few sites you could order from were
hand-made at great expense by web consultants.  We knew that if
online shopping ever took off, these sites would have to be generated
by software, so we wrote some.  Pretty straightforward.<br><br>It seems like the best problems to solve are ones that affect you
personally.  Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a computer,
Google because Larry and Sergey couldn't find stuff online, Hotmail
because Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith couldn't exchange email at
work.<br><br>So instead of copying the Facebook, with some variation that the
Facebook rightly ignored, look for ideas from the other direction.
Instead of starting from companies and working back to the problems
they solved, look for problems and imagine the company that might
solve them. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>
What do people complain about?  What do you wish there was?<br><br><b>5. Obstinacy</b><br><br>In some fields the way to succeed is to have a vision of what you
want to achieve, and to hold true to it no matter what setbacks you
encounter.  Starting startups is not one of them.  The stick-to-your-vision
approach works for something like winning an Olympic gold medal,
where the problem is well-defined.  Startups are more like science,
where you need to follow the trail wherever it leads.<br><br>So don't get too attached to your original plan, because it's
probably wrong.  Most successful startups end up doing something
different than they originally intended — often so different that
it doesn't even seem like the same company.  You have to be prepared
to see the better idea when it arrives.  And the hardest part of
that is often discarding your old idea.<br><br>But openness to new ideas has to be tuned just right.  Switching
to a new idea every week will be equally fatal.  Is there some kind
of external test you can use?  One is to ask whether the ideas
represent some kind of progression.  If in each new idea you're
able to re-use most of what you built for the previous ones, then
you're probably in a process that converges.  Whereas if you keep
restarting from scratch, that's a bad sign.<br><br>Fortunately there's someone you can ask for advice: your users.  If
you're thinking about turning in some new direction and your users
seem excited about it, it's probably a good bet.<br><br><b>6. Hiring Bad Programmers</b><br><br>I forgot to include this in the early versions of the list,
because nearly all the founders I know are programmers.  This is
not a serious problem for them.  They might accidentally hire someone
bad, but it's not going to kill the company.  In a pinch they can
do whatever's required themselves.<br><br>But when I think about what killed most of the startups in the
e-commerce business back in the 90s, it was bad programmers.  A lot
of those companies were started by business guys who thought the
way startups worked was that you had some clever idea and then hired
programmers to implement it.  That's actually much harder than it
sounds — almost impossibly hard in fact — because business guys
can't tell which are the good programmers.  They don't even get a
shot at the best ones, because no one really good wants a job
implementing the vision of a business guy.<br><br>In practice what happens is that the business guys choose people
they think are good programmers (it says here on his resume that
he's a Microsoft Certified Developer) but who aren't.  Then they're
mystified to find that their startup lumbers along like a World War
II bomber while their competitors scream past like jet fighters.
This kind of startup is in the same position as a big company,
but without the advantages.<br><br>So how do you pick good programmers if you're not a programmer?  I
don't think there's an answer.  I was about to say you'd have to
find a good programmer to help you hire people.  But if you can't
recognize good programmers, how would you even do that?<br><br><b>7. Choosing the Wrong Platform</b><br><br>A related problem (since it tends to be done by bad programmers)
is choosing the wrong platform.  For example, I think a lot of
startups during the Bubble killed themselves by deciding to build
server-based applications on Windows.  Hotmail was still running
on FreeBSD for years after Microsoft bought it, presumably because
Windows couldn't handle the load.  If Hotmail's founders
had chosen to use Windows, they would have been swamped.<br><br>PayPal only just dodged this bullet.  After they merged with X.com,
the new CEO wanted to switch to Windows — even after PayPal cofounder
Max Levchin showed that their software scaled only 1% as well on
Windows as Unix.  Fortunately for PayPal they switched CEOs instead.<br><br>Platform is a vague word.  It could mean an operating system, or a
programming language, or a "framework" built on top of a programming
language.  It implies something that both supports and limits, like
the foundation of a house.<br><br>The scary thing about platforms is that there are always some that
seem to outsiders to be fine, responsible choices and yet, like
Windows in the 90s, will destroy you if you choose them.  Java
applets were probably the most spectacular example.  This was
supposed to be the new way of delivering applications.  Presumably
it killed just about 100% of the startups who believed that.<br><br>How do you pick the right platforms?  The usual way is to hire good
programmers and let them choose.  But there is a trick you could
use if you're not a programmer: visit a top computer science
department and see what they use in research projects.<br><br><b>8. Slowness in Launching</b><br><br>Companies of all sizes have a hard time getting software done.  It's
intrinsic to the medium; software is always 85% done.  It takes an
effort of will to push through this and get something released to
users.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Startups make all kinds of excuses for delaying their launch.  Most
are equivalent to the ones people use for procrastinating in everyday
life.  There's something that needs to happen first.  Maybe.  But
if the software were 100% finished and ready to launch at the push
of a button, would they still be waiting?<br><br>One reason to launch quickly is that it forces you to actually
<i>finish</i> some quantum of work.  Nothing is truly finished till it's
released; you can see that from the rush of work that's always
involved in releasing anything, no matter how finished you thought
it was.  The other reason you need to launch is that it's only by
bouncing your idea off users that you fully understand it.<br><br>Several distinct problems manifest themselves as delays in launching:
working too slowly; not truly understanding the problem; fear of
having to deal with users; fear of being judged; working on too
many different things; excessive perfectionism.  Fortunately you
can combat all of them by the simple expedient of forcing yourself
to launch <i>something</i> fairly quickly.<br><br><b>9. Launching Too Early</b><br><br>Launching too slowly has probably killed a hundred times more
startups than launching too fast, but it is possible to launch too
fast.  The danger here is that you ruin your reputation.  You launch
something, the early adopters try it out, and if it's no good they
may never come back.<br><br>So what's the minimum you need to launch?  We suggest startups think
about what they plan to do, identify a core that's both (a) useful
on its own and (b) something that can be incrementally expanded
into the whole project, and then get that done as soon as possible.<br><br>This is the same approach I (and many other programmers) use for
writing software.  Think about the overall goal, then start by
writing the smallest subset of it that does anything useful.  If
it's a subset, you'll have to write it anyway, so in the worst case
you won't be wasting your time.  But more likely you'll find that
implementing a working subset is both good for morale and helps you
see more clearly what the rest should do.<br><br>The early adopters you need to impress are fairly tolerant.  They
don't expect a newly launched product to do everything; it just has
to do <i>something</i>.<br><br><b>10. Having No Specific User in Mind</b><br><br>You can't build things users like without understanding them.  I
mentioned earlier that the most successful startups seem to have
begun by trying to solve a problem their founders had.  Perhaps
there's a rule here: perhaps you create wealth in proportion to how
well you understand the problem you're solving, and the problems
you understand best are your own. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>That's just a theory.  What's not a theory is the converse: if
you're trying to solve problems you don't understand, you're hosed.<br><br>And yet a surprising number of founders seem willing to
assume that someone, they're not sure exactly who, will want what
they're building.  Do the founders want it?  No, they're not the
target market.  Who is?  Teenagers.  People interested in local
events (that one is a perennial tarpit).  Or "business" users.  What
business users?  Gas stations?  Movie studios?  Defense contractors?<br><br>You can of course build something for users other than yourself.
We did.  But you should realize you're stepping into dangerous
territory.  You're flying on instruments, in effect, so you should
(a) consciously shift gears, instead of assuming you can rely on
your intuitions as you ordinarily would, and (b) look at the
instruments.<br><br>In this case the instruments are the users.  When designing for
other people you have to be empirical.  You can no longer guess
what will work; you have to find users and measure their responses.
So if you're going to make something for teenagers or "business"
users or some other group that doesn't include you, you have to be
able to talk some specific ones into using what you're making.  If
you can't, you're on the wrong track.<br><br><b>11. Raising Too Little Money</b><br><br>Most successful startups take funding at some point.  Like having
more than one founder, it seems a good bet statistically.  How much
should you take, though?<br><br>Startup funding is measured in time.  Every startup that isn't
profitable (meaning nearly all of them, initially) has a certain
amount of time left before the money runs out and they have to stop.
This is sometimes referred to as runway, as in "How much runway do
you have left?"  It's a good metaphor because it reminds you that
when the money runs out you're going to be airborne or dead.<br><br>Too little money means not enough to get airborne.  What airborne
means depends on the situation.  Usually you have to advance to a
visibly higher level: if all you have is an idea, a working prototype;
if you have a prototype, launching; if you're launched, significant
growth.  It depends on investors, because until you're profitable
that's who you have to convince.<br><br>So if you take money from investors, you have to take enough to get
to the next step, whatever that is.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font>
Fortunately you have some
control over both how much you spend and what the next step is.  We
advise startups to set both low, initially: spend practically
nothing, and make your initial goal simply to build a solid prototype.
This gives you maximum flexibility.<br><br><b>12. Spending Too Much</b><br><br>It's hard to distinguish spending too much from raising too little.
If you run out of money, you could say either was the cause.  The
only way to decide which to call it is by comparison with other
startups.  If you raised five million and ran out of money, you
probably spent too much.<br><br>Burning through too much money is not as common as it used to be.
Founders seem to have learned that lesson.  Plus it keeps getting
cheaper to start a startup.  So as of this writing few startups
spend too much.  None of the ones we've funded have.  (And not just
because we make small investments; many have gone on to raise further
rounds.)<br><br>The classic way to burn through cash is by hiring a lot of people.
This bites you twice: in addition to increasing your costs, it slows
you down—so money that's getting consumed faster has to last
longer.  Most hackers understand why that happens; Fred Brooks
explained it in The Mythical Man-Month.<br><br>We have three general suggestions about hiring: (a) don't do it if
you can avoid it, (b) pay people with equity rather than salary,
not just to save money, but because you want the kind of people who
are committed enough to prefer that, and (c) only hire people who
are either going to write code or go out and get users, because
those are the only things you need at first.<br><br><b>13. Raising Too Much Money</b><br><br>It's obvious how too little money could kill you, but is there such
a thing as having too much?<br><br>Yes and no.  The problem is not so much the money itself as what
comes with it.  As one VC who spoke at Y Combinator said, "Once you
take several million dollars of my money, the clock is ticking."
If VCs fund you, they're not going to let you just put the money
in the bank and keep operating as two guys living on ramen.  They
want that money to go to work. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font>
At the very least you'll move
into proper office space and hire more people.  That will change
the atmosphere, and not entirely for the better.  Now most of your
people will be employees rather than founders. They won't be as
committed; they'll need to be told what to do; they'll start to
engage in office politics.<br><br>When you raise a lot of money, your company moves to the suburbs
and has kids.<br><br>Perhaps more dangerously, once you take a lot of money it gets
harder to change direction.  Suppose your initial plan was to sell
something to companies.  After taking VC money you hire a sales
force to do that. What happens now if you realize you should be
making this for consumers instead of businesses?  That's a completely
different kind of selling.  What happens, in practice, is that you
don't realize that.  The more people you have, the more you stay
pointed in the same direction.<br><br>Another drawback of large investments is the time they take.  The
time required to raise money grows with the amount.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font>
When the
amount rises into the millions, investors get very cautious.  VCs
never quite say yes or no; they just engage you in an apparently
endless conversation.  Raising VC scale investments is thus a huge
time sink — more work, probably, than the startup itself.   And you
don't want to be spending all your time talking to investors while
your competitors are spending theirs building things.<br><br>We advise founders who go on to seek VC money to take the first
reasonable deal they get.  If you get an offer from a reputable
firm at a reasonable valuation with no unusually onerous terms,
just take it and get on with building the company.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font>
Who cares
if you could get a 30% better deal elsewhere?  Economically, startups
are an all-or-nothing game.  Bargain-hunting among investors is a
waste of time.<br><br><b>14. Poor Investor Management</b><br><br>As a founder, you have to manage your investors.  You shouldn't
ignore them, because they may have useful insights.  But neither
should you let them run the company.  That's supposed to be your
job.  If investors had sufficient vision to run the companies
they fund, why didn't they start them?<br><br>Pissing off investors by ignoring them is probably less dangerous
than caving in to them.  In our startup, we erred on the ignoring
side.  A lot of our energy got drained
away in disputes with investors instead of going into the product.
But this was less costly than giving in, which would probably have
destroyed the company.  If the founders know what they're doing,
it's better to have half their attention focused on the product
than the full attention of investors who don't.<br><br>How hard you have to work on managing investors usually depends on
how much money you've taken.  When you raise VC-scale money, the
investors get a great deal of control.  If they have a board majority,
they're literally your bosses.  In the more common case, where
founders and investors are equally represented and the deciding
vote is cast by neutral outside directors, all the investors have
to do is convince the outside directors and they control the company.<br><br>If things go well, this shouldn't matter.  So long as you seem to
be advancing rapidly, most investors will leave you alone.  But
things don't always go smoothly in startups.  Investors have made
trouble even for the most successful companies.  One of the most
famous examples is Apple, whose board made a nearly fatal blunder
in firing Steve Jobs.  Apparently even Google got a lot of grief
from their investors early on.<br><br><b>15. Sacrificing Users to (Supposed) Profit</b><br><br>When I said at the beginning that if you make something users want,
you'll be fine, you may have noticed I didn't mention anything about
having the right business model.  That's not because making money
is unimportant.  I'm not suggesting that founders start companies
with no chance of making money in the hope of unloading them before
they tank.  The reason we tell founders not to worry about the
business model initially is that making something people want is
so much harder.<br><br>I don't know why it's so hard to make something people want.  It
seems like it should be straightforward.  But you can tell it must
be hard by how few startups do it.<br><br>Because making something people want is so much harder than making
money from it, you should leave business models for later, just as
you'd leave some trivial but messy feature for version 2.  In version
1, solve the core problem.  And the core problem in a startup is
how to <a href="wealth.html">create wealth</a> 
(= how much people want something x the number
who want it), not how to convert that wealth into money.<br><br>The companies that win are the ones that put users first.  Google,
for example.  They made search work, then worried about how to make
money from it.  And yet some startup founders still think it's
irresponsible not to focus on the business model from the beginning.
They're often encouraged in this by investors whose experience comes
from less malleable industries.<br><br>It <i>is</i> irresponsible not to think about business models.  It's
just ten times more irresponsible not to think about the product.<br><br><b>16. Not Wanting to Get Your Hands Dirty</b><br><br>Nearly all programmers would rather spend their time writing code
and have someone else handle the messy business of extracting money
from it.  And not just the lazy ones.  Larry and Sergey apparently
felt this way too at first.  After developing their new search
algorithm, the first thing they tried was to get some other company
to buy it.<br><br>Start a company?  Yech.  Most hackers would rather just have ideas.
But as Larry and Sergey found, there's not much of a market for
ideas.  No one trusts an idea till you embody it in a product and
use that to grow a user base.  Then they'll pay big time.<br><br>Maybe this will change, but I doubt it will change much.  There's
nothing like users for convincing acquirers.  It's not just that
the risk is decreased.  The acquirers are human, and they have a
hard time paying a bunch of young guys millions of dollars just for
being clever.  When the idea is embodied in a company with a lot
of users, they can tell themselves they're buying the users rather
than the cleverness, and this is easier for them to swallow.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you're going to attract users, you'll probably have to get up
from your computer and go find some.  It's unpleasant work, but if
you can make yourself do it you have a much greater chance of
succeeding.  In the first batch of startups we funded, in the summer
of 2005, most of the founders spent all their time building their
applications.  But there was one who was away half the time talking
to executives at cell phone companies, trying to arrange deals.
Can you imagine anything more painful for a hacker?
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#777777">10</font></a>]</font>
But it
paid off, because this startup seems the most successful of that
group by an order of magnitude.<br><br>If you want to start a startup, you have to face the fact that you
can't just hack.  At least one hacker will have to spend some of
the time doing business stuff.<br><br><b>17. Fights Between Founders</b><br><br>Fights between founders are surprisingly common.  About 20% of the
startups we've funded have had a founder leave.  It happens so often
that we've reversed our attitude to vesting.  We still don't require
it, but now we advise founders to vest so there will be an orderly
way for people to quit.<br><br>A founder leaving doesn't necessarily kill a startup, though.  Plenty
of successful startups have had that happen. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#777777">11</font></a>]</font>
Fortunately it's
usually the least committed founder who leaves.  If there are three
founders and one who was lukewarm leaves, big deal.  If you have
two and one leaves, or a guy with critical technical skills leaves,
that's more of a problem.  But even that is survivable.  Blogger
got down to one person, and they bounced back.<br><br>Most of the disputes I've seen between founders could have been
avoided if they'd been more careful about who they started a company
with.  Most disputes are not due to the situation but the people.
Which means they're inevitable.  And most founders who've been
burned by such disputes probably had misgivings, which they suppressed,
when they started the company.  Don't suppress misgivings.  It's
much easier to fix problems before the company is started than
after.  So don't include your housemate in your startup because
he'd feel left out otherwise.  Don't start a company with someone
you dislike because they have some skill you need and you worry you
won't find anyone else.  The people are the most important ingredient
in a startup, so don't compromise there.<br><br><b>18. A Half-Hearted Effort</b><br><br>The failed startups you hear most about are the spectacular
flameouts.  Those are actually the elite of failures.  The most
common type is not the one that makes spectacular mistakes, but the
one that doesn't do much of anything — the one we never even hear
about, because it was some project a couple guys started on the
side while working on their day jobs, but which never got anywhere
and was gradually abandoned.<br><br>Statistically, if you want to avoid failure, it would seem like the
most important thing is to quit your day job.  Most founders of
failed startups don't quit their day jobs, and most founders of
successful ones do.  If startup failure were a disease, the CDC
would be issuing bulletins warning people to avoid day jobs.<br><br>Does that mean you should quit your day job?  Not necessarily.  I'm
guessing here, but I'd guess that many of these would-be founders
may not have the kind of determination it takes to start a company,
and that in the back of their minds, they know it.  The reason they
don't invest more time in their startup is that they know it's a
bad investment.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#777777">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>I'd also guess there's some band of people who could have succeeded
if they'd taken the leap and done it full-time, but didn't. I have
no idea how wide this band is, but if the winner/borderline/hopeless
progression has the sort of distribution you'd expect, the number
of people who could have made it, if they'd quit their day job, is
probably an order of magnitude larger than the number who do make
it.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#777777">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>If that's true, most startups that could succeed fail because the
founders don't devote their whole efforts to them.  That certainly
accords with what I see out in the world.  Most startups fail because
they don't make something people want, and the reason most don't
is that they don't try hard enough.<br><br>In other words, starting startups is just like everything else.
The biggest mistake you can make is not to try hard enough.  To the
extent there's a secret to success, it's not to be in denial about
that.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This is not a complete list of the causes of failure,
just those you can control.  There are also several you can't,
notably ineptitude and bad luck.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Ironically, one variant of the Facebook that might work is a
facebook exclusively for college students.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Steve Jobs tried to motivate people by saying "Real artists
ship."  This is a fine sentence, but unfortunately not true.  Many
famous works of art are unfinished.  It's true in fields that have
hard deadlines, like architecture and filmmaking, but even there
people tend to be tweaking stuff till it's yanked out of their
hands.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
There's probably also a second factor: startup founders tend
to be at the leading edge of technology, so problems they face are
probably especially valuable.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
You should take more than you think you'll need, maybe 50% to
100% more, because software takes longer to write and deals longer
to close than you expect.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Since people sometimes call us VCs, I should add that we're
not.  VCs invest large amounts of other people's money.  We invest
small amounts of our own, like angel investors.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Not linearly of course, or it would take forever to raise five
million dollars.  In practice it just feels like it takes forever.<br><br>Though if you include the cases where VCs don't invest, it would
literally take forever in the median case.  And maybe we should,
because the danger of chasing large investments is not just that
they take a long time.  That's the <i>best</i> case.  The real danger
is that you'll expend a lot of time and get nothing.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Some VCs will offer you an artificially low valuation to see
if you have the balls to ask for more.  It's lame that VCs play
such games, but some do.  If you're dealing with one of those you
should push back on the valuation a bit.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Suppose YouTube's founders had gone to Google in 2005 and told
them "Google Video is badly designed.  Give us $10 million and we'll
tell you all the mistakes you made."  They would have gotten
the royal raspberry.  Eighteen months later Google paid $1.6 billion
for the same lesson, partly because they could then tell themselves
that they were buying a phenomenon, or a community, or some vague
thing like that.<br><br>I don't mean to be hard on Google.  They did better than their
competitors, who may have now missed the video boat entirely.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
Yes, actually: dealing with the government.  But phone companies
are up there.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
Many more than most people realize, because companies don't advertise
this.  Did you know Apple originally had three founders?<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
I'm not dissing these people.  I don't have the determination
myself.  I've twice come close to starting startups since Viaweb,
and both times I bailed because I realized that without the spur
of poverty I just wasn't willing to endure the stress of a startup.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
So how do you know whether you're in the category of people
who should quit their day job, or the presumably larger one who
shouldn't?  I got to the point of saying that this was hard to judge
for yourself and that you should seek outside advice, before realizing
that that's what we do.  We think of ourselves as investors, but
viewed from the other direction Y Combinator is a service for
advising people whether or not to quit their day job.  We could be
mistaken, and no doubt often are, but we do at least bet money on
our conclusions.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, Greg McAdoo, and Robert Morris

Each person has things they like, but no one's preferences are any
better than anyone else's.  There is no such thing as <i>good</i> taste.<br><br>Like a lot of things I grew up believing, this turns out to be
false, and I'm going to try to explain why.<br><br>One problem with saying there's no such thing as good taste is that
it also means there's no such thing as good art.  If there were
good art, then people who liked it would have better taste than
people who didn't.  So if you discard taste, you also have to discard
the idea of art being good, and artists being good at making it.<br><br>It was pulling on that thread that unravelled my childhood faith
in relativism.  When you're trying to make things, taste becomes a
practical matter.  You have to decide what to do next.  Would it
make the painting better if I changed that part?  If there's no
such thing as better, it doesn't matter what you do.  In fact, it
doesn't matter if you paint at all.  You could just go out and buy
a ready-made blank canvas.  If there's no such thing as good, that
would be just as great an achievement as the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel.  Less laborious, certainly, but if you can achieve the same
level of performance with less effort, surely that's more impressive,
not less.<br><br>Yet that doesn't seem quite right, does it?<br><br><b>Audience</b><br><br>I think the key to this puzzle is to remember that art has an
audience.  Art has a purpose, which is to interest its audience.
Good art (like good anything) is art that achieves its purpose
particularly well.  The meaning of "interest" can vary.  Some works
of art are meant to shock, and others to please; some are meant to
jump out at you, and others to sit quietly in the background. But
all art has to work on an audience, and—here's the critical 
point—members of the audience share things in common.<br><br>For example, nearly all humans find human faces engaging.  It seems
to be wired into us.  Babies can recognize faces practically from
birth.  In fact, faces seem to have co-evolved with our interest
in them; the face is the body's billboard.  So all other things
being equal, a painting with faces in it will interest people more
than one without. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>One reason it's easy to believe that taste is merely personal
preference is that, if it isn't, how do you pick out the people
with better taste?  There are billions of people, each with their
own opinion; on what grounds can you prefer one to another?
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>But if audiences have a lot in common, you're not in a position of
having to choose one out of a random set of individual biases,
because the set isn't random.  All humans find faces 
engaging—practically by definition: face recognition is 
in our DNA.  And so
having a notion of good art, in the sense of art that does its job
well, doesn't require you to pick out a few individuals and label
their opinions as correct.  No matter who you pick, they'll find
faces engaging.<br><br>Of course, space aliens probably wouldn't find human faces engaging.
But there might be other things they shared in common with us.  The
most likely source of examples is math.  I expect space aliens would
agree with us most of the time about which of two proofs was better.
Erdos thought so.  He called a maximally elegant proof one out of
God's book, and presumably God's book is universal.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Once you start talking about audiences, you don't have to argue
simply that there are or aren't standards of taste.  Instead tastes
are a series of concentric rings, like ripples in a pond.  There
are some things that will appeal to you and your friends, others
that will appeal to most people your age, others that will appeal
to most humans, and perhaps others that would appeal to most sentient
beings (whatever that means).<br><br>The picture is slightly more complicated than that, because in the
middle of the pond there are overlapping sets of ripples.  For
example, there might be things that appealed particularly to men,
or to people from a certain culture.<br><br>If good art is art that interests its audience, then when you talk
about art being good, you also have to say for what audience.  So
is it meaningless to talk about art simply being good or bad?  No,
because one audience is the set of all possible humans.  I think
that's the audience people are implicitly talking about when they
say a work of art is good: they mean it would engage any human.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>And that is a meaningful test, because although, like any everyday
concept, "human" is fuzzy around the edges, there are a lot of
things practically all humans have in common.  In addition to our
interest in faces, there's something special about primary colors
for nearly all of us, because it's an artifact of the way our eyes
work.  Most humans will also find images of 3D objects engaging,
because that also seems to be built into our visual perception.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font>
And beneath that there's edge-finding, which makes images
with definite shapes more engaging than mere blur.<br><br>Humans have a lot more in common than this, of course.  My goal is
not to compile a complete list, just to show that there's some solid
ground here.  People's preferences aren't random.  So an artist
working on a painting and trying to decide whether to change some
part of it doesn't have to think "Why bother?  I might as well flip
a coin." Instead he can ask "What would make the painting more
interesting to people?"  And the reason you can't equal Michelangelo
by going out and buying a blank canvas is that the ceiling of the
Sistine Chapel is more interesting to people.<br><br>A lot of philosophers have had a hard time believing it was possible
for there to be objective standards for art. It seemed obvious that
beauty, for example, was something that happened in the head of the observer,
not something that was a property of objects.  It was thus 
"subjective" rather than "objective."  But in fact if you narrow the
definition of beauty to something that works a certain way on
humans, and you observe how much humans have in common, it turns out
to be a property of objects after all.   You don't
have to choose between something being a property of the   
subject or the object if subjects all react similarly.
Being good art is thus a property of objects as much as, say, being
toxic to humans is: it's good art if it consistently affects humans 
in a certain way.<br><br>
<b>Error</b><br><br>So could we figure out what the best art is by taking a vote?  After
all, if appealing to humans is the test, we should be able to just
ask them, right?<br><br>Well, not quite.  For products of nature that might work.  I'd be
willing to eat the apple the world's population had voted most
delicious, and I'd probably be willing to visit the beach they voted
most beautiful, but having to look at the painting they voted the
best would be a crapshoot.<br><br>Man-made stuff is different.  For one thing, artists, unlike apple
trees, often deliberately try to trick us.  Some tricks are quite
subtle.  For example, any work of art sets expectations by its level
of finish.  You don't expect photographic accuracy in something
that looks like a quick sketch.  So one widely used trick, especially
among illustrators, is to intentionally make a painting or drawing
look like it was done faster than it was.  The average person looks
at it and thinks: how amazingly skillful.  It's like saying something
clever in a conversation as if you'd thought of it on the spur of
the moment, when in fact you'd worked it out the day before.<br><br>Another much less subtle influence is brand.  If you go to see the
Mona Lisa, you'll probably be disappointed, because it's hidden
behind a thick glass wall and surrounded by a frenzied crowd taking
pictures of themselves in front of it.  At best you can see it the
way you see a friend across the room at a crowded party.  The Louvre
might as well replace it with copy; no one would be able to tell.
And yet the Mona Lisa is a small, dark painting.  If you found
people who'd never seen an image of it and sent them to a museum
in which it was hanging among other paintings with a tag labelling
it as a portrait by an unknown fifteenth century artist, most would
walk by without giving it a second look.<br><br>For the average person, brand dominates all other factors in the
judgement of art.  Seeing a painting they recognize from reproductions
is so overwhelming that their response to it as a painting is drowned
out.<br><br>And then of course there are the tricks people play on themselves.
Most adults looking at art worry that if they don't like what they're
supposed to, they'll be thought uncultured.  This doesn't just
affect what they claim to like; they actually make themselves like
things they're supposed to.<br><br>That's why you can't just take a vote.  Though appeal to people is
a meaningful test, in practice you can't measure it, just as you
can't find north using a compass with a magnet sitting next to it.
There are sources of error so powerful that if you take a vote, all
you're measuring is the error.<br><br>We can, however, approach our goal from another direction, by using
ourselves as guinea pigs.  You're human.  If you want to know what
the basic human reaction to a piece of art would be, you can at
least approach that by getting rid of the sources of error in your
own judgements.<br><br>For example, while anyone's reaction to a famous painting will be
warped at first by its fame, there are ways to decrease its effects.
One is to come back to the painting over and over.  After a few
days the fame wears off, and you can start to see it as a painting.
Another is to stand close.  A painting familiar from reproductions
looks more familiar from ten feet away; close in you see details
that get lost in reproductions, and which you're therefore seeing
for the first time.<br><br>There are two main kinds of error that get in the way of seeing a
work of art: biases you bring from your own circumstances, and
tricks played by the artist.  Tricks are straightforward to correct
for. Merely being aware of them usually prevents them from working.
For example, when I was ten I used to be very impressed by airbrushed
lettering that looked like shiny metal.  But once you study how
it's done, you see that it's a pretty cheesy trick—one of the
sort that relies on pushing a few visual buttons really hard to
temporarily overwhelm the viewer.  It's like trying to convince
someone by shouting at them.<br><br>The way not to be vulnerable to tricks is to explicitly seek out
and catalog them.  When you notice a whiff of dishonesty coming
from some kind of art, stop and figure out what's going on.  When
someone is obviously pandering to an audience that's easily fooled,
whether it's someone making shiny stuff to impress ten year olds,
or someone making conspicuously avant-garde stuff to impress would-be
intellectuals, learn how they do it.  Once you've seen enough
examples of specific types of tricks, you start to become a connoisseur
of trickery in general, just as professional magicians are.<br><br>What counts as a trick?  Roughly, it's something done with contempt
for the audience.  For example, the guys designing Ferraris in the
1950s were probably designing cars that they themselves admired.
Whereas I suspect over at General Motors the marketing people are
telling the designers, "Most people who buy SUVs do it to seem
manly, not to drive off-road. So don't worry about the suspension;
just make that sucker as big and tough-looking as you can." 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>I think with some effort you can make yourself nearly immune to
tricks.  It's harder to escape the influence of your own circumstances,
but you can at least move in that direction.  The way to do it is
to travel widely, in both time and space.  If you go and see all
the different kinds of things people like in other cultures, and
learn about all the different things people have liked in the past,
you'll probably find it changes what you like.  I doubt you could
ever make yourself into a completely universal person, if only
because you can only travel in one direction in time.  But if you
find a work of art that would appeal equally to your friends, to
people in Nepal, and to the ancient Greeks, you're probably onto
something.<br><br>My main point here is not how to have good taste, but that there
can even be such a thing.  And I think I've shown that.  There is
such a thing as good art. It's art that interests its human audience,
and since humans have a lot in common, what interests them is not
random.  Since there's such a thing as good art, there's
also such a thing as good taste, which is the ability to recognize
it.<br><br>If we were talking about the taste of apples, I'd agree that taste
is just personal preference.  Some people like certain kinds of
apples and others like other kinds, but how can you say that one
is right and the other wrong? 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>The thing is, art isn't apples.  Art is man-made. It comes with a
lot of cultural baggage, and in addition the people who make it
often try to trick us.  Most people's judgement of art is dominated
by these extraneous factors; they're like someone trying to judge
the taste of apples in a dish made of equal parts apples and jalapeno
peppers.  All they're tasting is the peppers.  So it turns out you
can pick out some people and say that they have better taste than
others: they're the ones who actually taste art like apples.<br><br>Or to put it more prosaically, they're the people who (a) are hard
to trick, and (b) don't just like whatever they grew up with.  If
you could find people who'd eliminated all such influences on their
judgement, you'd probably still see variation in what they liked.
But because humans have so much in common, you'd also find they
agreed on a lot.  They'd nearly all prefer the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel to a blank canvas.<br><br><b>Making It</b><br><br>I wrote this essay because I was tired of hearing "taste is subjective"
and wanted to kill it once and for all. Anyone who makes things
knows intuitively that's not true.  When you're trying to make art,
the temptation to be lazy is as great as in any other kind of work.
Of course it matters to do a good job.  And yet you can see how
great a hold "taste is subjective" has even in the art world by how
nervous it makes people to talk about art being good or bad.  Those
whose jobs require them to judge art, like curators, mostly resort
to euphemisms like "significant" or "important" or (getting dangerously
close) "realized." 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>I don't have any illusions that being able to talk about art being
good or bad will cause the people who talk about it to have anything
more useful to say.  Indeed, one of the reasons "taste is subjective"
found such a receptive audience is that, historically, the things
people have said about good taste have generally been such nonsense.<br><br>It's not for the people who talk about art that I want to free the
idea of good art, but for those who 
<a href="taste.html">make</a> it.  Right now, ambitious
kids going to art school run smack into a brick wall.  They arrive
hoping one day to be as good as the famous artists they've seen in
books, and the first thing they learn is that the concept of good
has been retired.  Instead everyone is just supposed to explore
their own personal vision. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>When I was in art school, we were looking one day at a slide of
some great fifteenth century painting, and one of the students asked
"Why don't artists paint like that now?" The room suddenly got
quiet.  Though rarely asked out loud, this question lurks uncomfortably
in the back of every art student's mind.  It was as if someone had
brought up the topic of lung cancer in a meeting within Philip
Morris.<br><br>"Well," the professor replied, "we're interested in different
questions now."  He was a pretty nice guy, but at the time I couldn't
help wishing I could send him back to fifteenth century Florence
to explain in person to Leonardo &amp; Co. how we had moved beyond their
early, limited concept of art.  Just imagine that conversation.<br><br>In fact, one of the reasons artists in fifteenth century Florence made
such great things was that they believed you could make great things.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#777777">10</font></a>]</font>
They were intensely competitive and were always trying to outdo
one another, like mathematicians or physicists today—maybe like
anyone who has ever done anything really well.<br><br>The idea that you could make great things was not just a useful
illusion.  They were actually right.  So the most important consequence
of realizing there can be good art is that it frees artists to try
to make it.  To the ambitious kids arriving at art school this year
hoping one day to make great things, I say: don't believe it when
they tell you this is a naive and outdated ambition.  There is such
a thing as good art, and if you try to make it, there are people
who will notice.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This is not to say, of course, that good paintings must
have faces in them, just that everyone's visual piano has that key
on it.  There are situations in which you want to avoid faces,
precisely because they attract so much attention.  But you can see
how universally faces work by their prevalence in
advertising.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
The other reason it's easy to believe is that it makes people
feel good.  To a kid, this idea is crack.  In every other respect
they're constantly being told that they have a lot to learn.  But
in this they're perfect.  Their opinion carries the same weight as
any adult's.  You should probably question anything you believed
as a kid that you'd want to believe this much.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
It's conceivable that the elegance of proofs is quantifiable,
in the sense that there may be some formal measure that turns out
to coincide with mathematicians' judgements.  Perhaps it would be
worth trying to make a formal language for proofs in which those
considered more elegant consistently came out shorter (perhaps after
being macroexpanded or compiled).<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Maybe it would be possible to make art that would appeal to
space aliens, but I'm not going to get into that because (a) it's
too hard to answer, and (b) I'm satisfied if I can establish that
good art is a meaningful idea for human audiences.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
If early abstract paintings seem more interesting than later
ones, it may be because the first abstract painters were trained
to paint from life, and their hands thus tended to make the kind
of gestures you use in representing physical things.  In effect
they were saying "scaramara" instead of "uebfgbsb."<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
It's a bit more complicated, because sometimes artists
unconsciously use tricks by imitating art that does.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
I phrased this in terms of the taste of apples because if
people can see the apples, they can be fooled.  When I was a kid
most apples were a variety called Red Delicious that had been bred
to look appealing in stores, but which didn't taste very good.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
To be fair, curators are in a difficult position.  If they're
dealing with recent art, they have to include things in shows that
they think are bad.  That's because the test for what gets included
in shows is basically the market price, and for recent art that is
largely determined by successful businessmen and their wives.  So
it's not always intellectual dishonesty that makes curators and
dealers use neutral-sounding language.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
What happens in practice is that everyone gets really good at
<i>talking</i> about art.  As the art itself gets more random, the effort
that would have gone into the work goes instead into the intellectual
sounding theory behind it.  "My work represents an exploration of
gender and sexuality in an urban context," etc.  Different people
win at that game.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
There were several other reasons, including that Florence was
then the richest and most sophisticated city in the world, and that
they lived in a time before photography had (a) killed portraiture
as a source of income and (b) made brand the dominant factor in the
sale of art.<br><br>Incidentally, I'm not saying that good art = fifteenth century
European art.  I'm not saying we should make what they made, but
that we should work like they worked.  There are fields now in which
many people work with the same energy and honesty that fifteenth
century artists did, but art is not one of them.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597141">Founders at Work</a>.)</i><br><br>Apparently sprinters reach their highest speed right out of the
blocks, and spend the rest of the race slowing down.  The winners
slow down the least.  It's that way with most startups too.  The
earliest phase is usually the most productive.  That's when they
have the really big ideas.  Imagine what Apple was like when 100%
of its employees were either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak.<br><br>The striking thing about this phase is that it's completely different
from most people's idea of what business is like.  If you looked
in people's heads (or stock photo collections) for images representing
"business," you'd get images of people dressed up in suits, groups
sitting around conference tables looking serious, Powerpoint
presentations, people producing thick reports for one another to
read.   Early stage startups are the exact opposite of this.  And
yet they're probably the most productive part of the whole economy.<br><br>Why the disconnect?  I think there's a general principle at work
here: the less energy people expend on performance, the more they
expend on appearances to compensate.  More often than not the energy
they expend on seeming impressive makes their actual performance
worse.  A few years ago I read an article in which a car magazine
modified the "sports" model of some production car to get the fastest
possible standing quarter mile.  You know how they did it?  They
cut off all the crap the manufacturer had bolted onto the car to
make it <i>look</i> fast.<br><br>Business is broken the same way that car was.  The effort that goes
into looking productive is not merely wasted, but actually makes
organizations less productive.  Suits, for example.  Suits do not
help people to think better.  I bet most executives at big companies
do their best thinking when they wake up on Sunday morning and go
downstairs in their bathrobe to make a cup of coffee.  That's when
you have ideas.  Just imagine what a company would be like if people
could think that well at work.  People do in startups, at least
some of the time.  (Half the time you're in a panic because your
servers are on fire, but the other half you're thinking as deeply
as most people only get to sitting alone on a Sunday morning.)<br><br>Ditto for most of the other differences between startups and what
passes for productivity in big companies.  And yet conventional
ideas of professionalism have such an iron grip on our minds that
even startup founders are affected by them.  In our startup, when
outsiders came to visit we tried hard to seem "professional." We'd
clean up our offices, wear better clothes, try to arrange that a
lot of people were there during conventional office hours.  In fact,
programming didn't get done by well-dressed people at clean desks
during office hours.  It got done by badly dressed people (I was
notorious for programmming wearing just a towel) in offices strewn
with junk at 2 in the morning.  But no visitor would understand
that.  Not even investors, who are supposed to be able to recognize
real productivity when they see it.  Even we were affected by the
conventional wisdom.  We thought of ourselves as impostors, succeeding
despite being totally unprofessional.  It was as if we'd created a
Formula 1 car but felt sheepish because it didn't look like a car
was supposed to look.<br><br>In the car world, there are at least some people who know that a
high performance car looks like a Formula 1 racecar, not a sedan
with giant rims and a fake spoiler bolted to the trunk.  Why not
in business?  Probably because startups are so small.  The really
dramatic growth happens when a startup only has three or four people,
so only three or four people see that, whereas tens of thousands
see business as it's practiced by Boeing or Philip Morris.<br><br>This book can help fix that problem, by showing everyone what, till
now, only a handful people got to see: what happens in the first
year of a startup.  This is what real productivity looks like. This
is the Formula 1 racecar.  It looks weird, but it goes fast.<br><br>Of course, big companies won't be able to do everything these
startups do.  In big companies there's always going to be more
politics, and less scope for individual decisions.  But seeing what
startups are really like will at least show other organizations
what to aim for.  The time may soon be coming when instead of
startups trying to seem more corporate, corporations will try to
seem more like startups.  That would be a good thing.<br><br><br><br>

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><div><div><div></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></div><div><br><br><div><h1 id="wisdom">Is It Worth Being Wise?</h1><br><br>February 2007<br><br>A few days ago I finally figured out something I've wondered about
for 25 years: the relationship between wisdom and intelligence.
Anyone can see they're not the same by the number of people who are
smart, but not very wise.  And yet intelligence and wisdom do seem
related.  How?<br><br>What is wisdom?  I'd say it's knowing what to do in a lot of
situations.  I'm not trying to make a deep point here about the
true nature of wisdom, just to figure out how we use the word.  A
wise person is someone who usually knows the right thing to do.<br><br>And yet isn't being smart also knowing what to do in certain
situations?  For example, knowing what to do when the teacher tells
your elementary school class to add all the numbers from 1 to 100?
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Some say wisdom and intelligence apply to different types of
problems—wisdom to human problems and intelligence to abstract
ones.  But that isn't true.  Some wisdom has nothing to do with
people: for example, the wisdom of the engineer who knows certain
structures are less prone to failure than others.  And certainly
smart people can find clever solutions to human problems as well
as abstract ones. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another popular explanation is that wisdom comes from experience
while intelligence is innate.  But people are not simply wise in
proportion to how much experience they have.  Other things must
contribute to wisdom besides experience, and some may be innate: a
reflective disposition, for example.<br><br>Neither of the conventional explanations of the difference between
wisdom and intelligence stands up to scrutiny.  So what is the
difference?  If we look at how people use the words "wise" and
"smart," what they seem to mean is different shapes of performance.<br><br><b>Curve</b><br><br>"Wise" and "smart" are both ways of saying someone knows what to
do.  The difference is that "wise" means one has a high average
outcome across all situations, and "smart" means one does spectacularly
well in a few.  That is, if you had a graph in which the x axis
represented situations and the y axis the outcome, the graph of the
wise person would be high overall, and the graph of the smart person
would have high peaks.<br><br>The distinction is similar to the rule that one should judge talent
at its best and character at its worst.  Except you judge intelligence
at its best, and wisdom by its average.  That's how the two are
related: they're the two different senses in which the same curve
can be high.<br><br>So a wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart
person knows what to do in situations where few others could.  We
need to add one more qualification: we should ignore cases where
someone knows what to do because they have inside information. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
But aside from that, I don't think we can get much more specific
without starting to be mistaken.<br><br>Nor do we need to.  Simple as it is, this explanation predicts, or
at least accords with, both of the conventional stories about the
distinction between wisdom and intelligence.  Human problems are
the most common type, so being good at solving those is key in
achieving a high average outcome.   And it seems natural that a
high average outcome depends mostly on experience, but that dramatic
peaks can only be achieved by people with certain rare, innate
qualities; nearly anyone can learn to be a good swimmer, but to be
an Olympic swimmer you need a certain body type.<br><br>This explanation also suggests why wisdom is such an elusive concept:
there's no such thing.  "Wise" means something—that one is
on average good at making the right choice.  But giving the name
"wisdom" to the supposed quality that enables one to do that doesn't
mean such a thing exists.  To the extent "wisdom" means anything,
it refers to a grab-bag of qualities as various as self-discipline,
experience, and empathy.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Likewise, though "intelligent" means something, we're asking for
trouble if we insist on looking for a single thing called "intelligence."
And whatever its components, they're not all innate.  We use the
word "intelligent" as an indication of ability: a smart person can
grasp things few others could.  It does seem likely there's some
inborn predisposition to intelligence (and wisdom too), but this
predisposition is not itself intelligence.<br><br>One reason we tend to think of intelligence as inborn is that people
trying to measure it have concentrated on the aspects of it that
are most measurable.  A quality that's inborn will obviously be
more convenient to work with than one that's influenced by experience,
and thus might vary in the course of a study.  The problem comes
when we drag the word "intelligence" over onto what they're measuring.
If they're measuring something inborn, they can't be measuring
intelligence.  Three year olds aren't smart.   When we describe one
as smart, it's shorthand for "smarter than other three year olds."<br><br><b>Split</b><br><br>Perhaps it's a technicality to point out that a predisposition to
intelligence is not the same as intelligence.  But it's an important
technicality, because it reminds us that we can become smarter,
just as we can become wiser.<br><br>The alarming thing is that we may have to choose between the two.<br><br>If wisdom and intelligence are the average and peaks of the same
curve, then they converge as the number of points on the curve
decreases.  If there's just one point, they're identical: the average
and maximum are the same.  But as the number of points increases,
wisdom and intelligence diverge.  And historically the number of
points on the curve seems to have been increasing: our ability is
tested in an ever wider range of situations.<br><br>In the time of Confucius and Socrates, people seem to have regarded
wisdom, learning, and intelligence as more closely related than we
do.  Distinguishing between "wise" and "smart" is a modern habit.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font>
And the reason we do is that they've been diverging.  As knowledge
gets more specialized, there are more points on the curve, and the
distinction between the spikes and the average becomes sharper,
like a digital image rendered with more pixels.<br><br>One consequence is that some old recipes may have become obsolete.
At the very least we have to go back and figure out if they were
really recipes for wisdom or intelligence.  But the really striking
change, as intelligence and wisdom drift apart, is that we may have
to decide which we prefer.  We may not be able to optimize for both
simultaneously.<br><br>Society seems to have voted for intelligence.  We no longer admire
the sage—not the way people did two thousand years ago.  Now
we admire the genius.  Because in fact the distinction we began
with has a rather brutal converse: just as you can be smart without
being very wise, you can be wise without being very smart.  That
doesn't sound especially admirable.  That gets you James Bond, who
knows what to do in a lot of situations, but has to rely on Q for
the ones involving math.<br><br>Intelligence and wisdom are obviously not mutually exclusive.  In
fact, a high average may help support high peaks.  But there are
reasons to believe that at some point you have to choose between
them.  One is the example of very smart people, who are so often
unwise that in popular culture this now seems to be regarded as the
rule rather than the exception.  Perhaps the absent-minded professor
is wise in his way, or wiser than he seems, but he's not wise in
the way Confucius or Socrates wanted people to be. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>New</b><br><br>For both Confucius and Socrates, wisdom, virtue, and happiness were
necessarily related.  The wise man was someone who knew what the
right choice was and always made it; to be the right choice, it had
to be morally right; he was therefore always happy, knowing he'd
done the best he could.  I can't think of many ancient philosophers
who would have disagreed with that, so far as it goes.<br><br>"The superior man is always happy; the small man sad," said Confucius.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Whereas a few years ago I read an interview with a mathematician
who said that most nights he went to bed discontented, feeling he
hadn't made enough progress.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font>
The Chinese and Greek words we
translate as "happy" didn't mean exactly what we do by it, but
there's enough overlap that this remark contradicts them.<br><br>Is the mathematician a small man because he's discontented?  No;
he's just doing a kind of work that wasn't very common in Confucius's
day.<br><br>Human knowledge seems to grow fractally.  Time after time, something
that seemed a small and uninteresting area—experimental error,
even—turns out, when examined up close, to have as much in
it as all knowledge up to that point.  Several of the fractal buds
that have exploded since ancient times involve inventing and
discovering new things.  Math, for example, used to be something a
handful of people did part-time.  Now it's the career of thousands.
And in work that involves making new things, some old rules don't
apply.<br><br>Recently I've spent some time advising people, and there I find the
ancient rule still works: try to understand the situation as well
as you can, give the best advice you can based on your experience,
and then don't worry about it, knowing you did all you could.  But
I don't have anything like this serenity when I'm writing an essay.
Then I'm worried.  What if I run out of ideas?  And when I'm writing,
four nights out of five I go to bed discontented, feeling I didn't
get enough done.<br><br>Advising people and writing are fundamentally different types of
work.  When people come to you with a problem and you have to figure
out the right thing to do, you don't (usually) have to invent
anything.  You just weigh the alternatives and try to judge which
is the prudent choice.  But <i>prudence</i> can't tell me what sentence
to write next.  The search space is too big.<br><br>Someone like a judge or a military officer can in much of his work
be guided by duty, but duty is no guide in making things.  Makers
depend on something more precarious: inspiration.  And like most
people who lead a precarious existence, they tend to be worried,
not contented.  In that respect they're more like the small man of
Confucius's day, always one bad harvest (or ruler) away from
starvation. Except instead of being at the mercy of weather and
officials, they're at the mercy of their own imagination.<br><br><b>Limits</b><br><br>To me it was a relief just to realize it might be ok to be discontented.
The idea that a successful person should be happy has thousands of
years of momentum behind it.  If I was any good, why didn't I have
the easy confidence winners are supposed to have?  But that, I now
believe, is like a runner asking "If I'm such a good athlete, why
do I feel so tired?" Good runners still get tired; they just get
tired at higher speeds.<br><br>People whose work is to invent or discover things are in the same
position as the runner.  There's no way for them to do the best
they can, because there's no limit to what they could do.  The
closest you can come is to compare yourself to other people.  But
the better you do, the less this matters.  An undergrad who gets
something published feels like a star.  But for someone at the top
of the field, what's the test of doing well?  Runners can at least
compare themselves to others doing exactly the same thing; if you
win an Olympic gold medal, you can be fairly content, even if you
think you could have run a bit faster.  But what is a novelist to
do?<br><br>Whereas if you're doing the kind of work in which problems are
presented to you and you have to choose between several alternatives,
there's an upper bound on your performance: choosing the best every
time.  In ancient societies, nearly all work seems to have been of
this type.  The peasant had to decide whether a garment was worth
mending, and the king whether or not to invade his neighbor, but
neither was expected to invent anything.  In principle they could
have; the king could have invented firearms, then invaded his
neighbor.  But in practice innovations were so rare that they weren't
expected of you, any more than goalkeepers are expected to score
goals. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font>
In practice, it seemed as if there was a correct decision
in every situation, and if you made it you'd done your job perfectly,
just as a goalkeeper who prevents the other team from scoring is
considered to have played a perfect game.<br><br>In this world, wisdom seemed paramount.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#777777">10</font></a>]</font>
Even now, most people
do work in which problems are put before them and they have to
choose the best alternative.  But as knowledge has grown more
specialized, there are more and more types of work in which people
have to make up new things, and in which performance is therefore
unbounded.  Intelligence has become increasingly important relative
to wisdom because there is more room for spikes.<br><br><b>Recipes</b><br><br>Another sign we may have to choose between intelligence and wisdom
is how different their recipes are.  Wisdom seems to come largely
from curing childish qualities, and intelligence largely from
cultivating them.<br><br>Recipes for wisdom, particularly ancient ones, tend to have a
remedial character.  To achieve wisdom one must cut away all the
debris that fills one's head on emergence from childhood, leaving
only the important stuff.  Both self-control and experience have
this effect: to eliminate the random biases that come from your own
nature and from the circumstances of your upbringing respectively.
That's not all wisdom is, but it's a large part of it.  Much of
what's in the sage's head is also in the head of every twelve year
old.  The difference is that in the head of the twelve year old
it's mixed together with a lot of random junk.<br><br>The path to intelligence seems to be through working on hard problems.
You develop intelligence as you might develop muscles, through
exercise.  But there can't be too much compulsion here.  No amount
of discipline can replace genuine curiosity.  So cultivating
intelligence seems to be a matter of identifying some bias in one's
character—some tendency to be interested in certain types of
things—and nurturing it.  Instead of obliterating your
idiosyncrasies in an effort to make yourself a neutral vessel for
the truth, you select one and try to grow it from a seedling into
a tree.<br><br>The wise are all much alike in their wisdom, but very smart people
tend to be smart in distinctive ways.<br><br>Most of our educational traditions aim at wisdom. So perhaps one
reason schools work badly is that they're trying to make intelligence
using recipes for wisdom.  Most recipes for wisdom have an element
of subjection.  At the very least, you're supposed to do what the
teacher says.  The more extreme recipes aim to break down your
individuality the way basic training does.  But that's not the route
to intelligence.  Whereas wisdom comes through humility, it may
actually help, in cultivating intelligence, to have a mistakenly
high opinion of your abilities, because that encourages you to keep
working.  Ideally till you realize how mistaken you were.<br><br>(The reason it's hard to learn new skills late in life is not just
that one's brain is less malleable.  Another probably even worse
obstacle is that one has higher standards.)<br><br>I realize we're on dangerous ground here.  I'm not proposing the
primary goal of education should be to increase students' "self-esteem."
That just breeds laziness.  And in any case, it doesn't really fool
the kids, not the smart ones.  They can tell at a young age that a
contest where everyone wins is a fraud.<br><br>A teacher has to walk a narrow path: you want to encourage kids to
come up with things on their own, but you can't simply applaud
everything they produce.  You have to be a good audience: appreciative,
but not too easily impressed.  And that's a lot of work.  You have
to have a good enough grasp of kids' capacities at different ages
to know when to be surprised.<br><br>That's the opposite of traditional recipes for education.  Traditionally
the student is the audience, not the teacher; the student's job is
not to invent, but to absorb some prescribed body of material.  (The
use of the term "recitation" for sections in some colleges is a
fossil of this.) The problem with these old traditions is that
they're too much influenced by recipes for wisdom.<br><br><b>Different</b><br><br>I deliberately gave this essay a provocative title; of course it's
worth being wise.  But I think it's important to understand the
relationship between intelligence and wisdom, and particularly what
seems to be the growing gap between them.  That way we can avoid
applying rules and standards to intelligence that are really meant
for wisdom.  These two senses of "knowing what to do" are more
different than most people realize.  The path to wisdom is through
discipline, and the path to intelligence through carefully selected
self-indulgence.  Wisdom is universal, and intelligence idiosyncratic.
And while wisdom yields calmness, intelligence much of the time
leads to discontentment.<br><br>That's particularly worth remembering.  A physicist friend recently
told me half his department was on Prozac.  Perhaps if we acknowledge
that some amount of frustration is inevitable in certain kinds
of work, we can mitigate its effects.  Perhaps we can box it up and
put it away some of the time, instead of letting it flow together
with everyday sadness to produce what seems an alarmingly large
pool.  At the very least, we can avoid being discontented about
being discontented.<br><br>If you feel exhausted, it's not necessarily because there's something
wrong with you.  Maybe you're just running fast.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Gauss was supposedly asked this when he was 10.  Instead of
laboriously adding together the numbers like the other students,
he saw that they consisted of 50 pairs that each summed to 101 (100
+ 1, 99 + 2, etc), and that he could just multiply 101 by 50 to get
the answer, 5050.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
A variant is that intelligence is the ability to solve problems,
and wisdom the judgement to know how to use those solutions.   But
while this is certainly an important relationship between wisdom
and intelligence, it's not the <i>distinction between</i> them.  Wisdom
is useful in solving problems too, and intelligence can help in
deciding what to do with the solutions.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
In judging both intelligence and wisdom we have to factor out
some knowledge. People who know the combination of a safe will be
better at opening it than people who don't, but no one would say
that was a test of intelligence or wisdom.<br><br>But knowledge overlaps with wisdom and probably also intelligence.
A knowledge of human nature is certainly part of wisdom.  So where
do we draw the line?<br><br>Perhaps the solution is to discount knowledge that at some point
has a sharp drop in utility.  For example, understanding French
will help you in a large number of situations, but its value drops
sharply as soon as no one else involved knows French.  Whereas the
value of understanding vanity would decline more gradually.<br><br>The knowledge whose utility drops sharply is the kind that has
little relation to other knowledge.  This includes mere conventions,
like languages and safe combinations, and also what we'd call
"random" facts, like movie stars' birthdays, or how to distinguish
1956 from 1957 Studebakers.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
People seeking some single thing called "wisdom" have been
fooled by grammar.  Wisdom is just knowing the right thing to do,
and there are a hundred and one different qualities that help in
that.  Some, like selflessness, might come from meditating in an
empty room, and others, like a knowledge of human nature, might
come from going to drunken parties.<br><br>Perhaps realizing this will help dispel the cloud of semi-sacred
mystery that surrounds wisdom in so many people's eyes.  The mystery
comes mostly from looking for something that doesn't exist.  And
the reason there have historically been so many different schools
of thought about how to achieve wisdom is that they've focused on
different components of it.<br><br>When I use the word "wisdom" in this essay, I mean no more than
whatever collection of qualities helps people make the right choice
in a wide variety of situations.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Even in English, our sense of the word "intelligence" is
surprisingly recent.  Predecessors like "understanding" seem to
have had a broader meaning.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
There is of course some uncertainty about how closely the remarks
attributed to Confucius and Socrates resemble their actual opinions.
I'm using these names as we use the name "Homer," to mean the
hypothetical people who said the things attributed to them.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
<i>Analects</i> VII:36, Fung trans.<br><br>Some translators use "calm" instead of "happy."  One source of
difficulty here is that present-day English speakers have a different
idea of happiness from many older societies.  Every language probably
has a word meaning "how one feels when things are going well," but
different cultures react differently when things go well.  We react
like children, with smiles and laughter.  But in a more reserved
society, or in one where life was tougher, the reaction might be a
quiet contentment.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
It may have been Andrew Wiles, but I'm not sure.  If anyone
remembers such an interview, I'd appreciate hearing from you.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Confucius claimed proudly that he had never invented
anything—that he had simply passed on an accurate account of
ancient traditions.  [<i>Analects</i> VII:1] It's hard for us now to
appreciate how important a duty it must have been in preliterate
societies to remember and pass on the group's accumulated knowledge.
Even in Confucius's time it still seems to have been the first duty
of the scholar.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
The bias toward wisdom in ancient philosophy may be exaggerated
by the fact that, in both Greece and China, many of the first
philosophers (including Confucius and Plato) saw themselves as
teachers of administrators, and so thought disproportionately about
such matters.  The few people who did invent things, like storytellers,
must have seemed an outlying data point that could be ignored.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston,

<p>
March 2007<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from talks at the 2007 
Startup School and the Berkeley CSUA.)</i><br><br>We've now been doing Y Combinator long enough to have some data
about success rates.  Our first batch, in the summer of 2005, had
eight startups in it.  Of those eight, it now looks as if at least
four succeeded.  Three have been acquired: 
<a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> was a merger of
two, Reddit and Infogami, and a third was acquired that we can't
talk about yet.  Another from that batch was 
<a href="http://loopt.com">Loopt</a>, which is doing
so well they could probably be acquired in about ten minutes if
they wanted to.<br><br>So about half the founders from that first summer, less than two
years ago, are now rich, at least by their standards.  (One thing
you learn when you get rich is that there are many degrees of it.)<br><br>I'm not ready to predict our success rate will stay as high as 50%.
That first batch could have been an anomaly.  But we should be able
to do better than the oft-quoted (and probably made
up) standard figure of 10%.  I'd feel safe aiming at 25%.<br><br>Even the founders who fail don't seem to have such a bad time.  Of
those first eight startups, three are now probably dead.  In two
cases the founders just went on to do other things at the end of
the summer.   I don't think they were traumatized by the experience.
The closest to a traumatic failure was Kiko, whose founders kept
working on their startup for a whole year before being squashed by
Google Calendar.  But they ended up happy.  They sold their software
on eBay for a quarter of a million dollars.  After they paid back
their angel investors, they had about a year's salary each.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font>
Then they immediately went on to start a new and much more exciting
startup, <a href="http://justin.tv">Justin.TV</a>.<br><br>So here is an even more striking statistic: 0% of that first batch
had a terrible experience.  They had ups and downs, like every
startup, but I don't think any would have traded it for a job in a
cubicle.  And that statistic is probably not an anomaly.  Whatever
our long-term success rate ends up being, I think the rate of people
who wish they'd gotten a regular job will stay close to 0%.<br><br>The big mystery to me is: why don't more people start startups?  If
nearly everyone who does it prefers it to a regular job, and a
significant percentage get rich, why doesn't everyone want to do
this?  A lot of people think we get thousands of applications for
each funding cycle.  In fact we usually only get several hundred.
Why don't more people apply?  And while it must seem to anyone
watching this world that startups are popping up like crazy, the
number is small compared to the number of people with the necessary
skills.  The great majority of programmers still go straight from
college to cubicle, and stay there.<br><br>It seems like people are not acting in their own interest.  What's
going on?   Well, I can answer that.  Because of Y Combinator's
position at the very start of the venture funding process, we're
probably the world's leading experts on the psychology of people
who aren't sure if they want to start a company.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with being unsure.  If you're a hacker thinking
about starting a startup and hesitating before taking the leap,
you're part of a grand tradition.  Larry and Sergey seem to have
felt the same before they started Google, and so did Jerry and Filo
before they started Yahoo.  In fact, I'd guess the most successful
startups are the ones started by uncertain hackers rather than
gung-ho business guys.<br><br>We have some evidence to support this.  Several of the most successful
startups we've funded told us later that they only decided to apply
at the last moment.  Some decided only hours before the deadline.<br><br>The way to deal with uncertainty is to analyze it into components.
Most people who are reluctant to do something have about eight
different reasons mixed together in their heads, and don't know
themselves which are biggest.  Some will be justified and some
bogus, but unless you know the relative proportion of each, you
don't know whether your overall uncertainty is mostly justified or
mostly bogus.<br><br>So I'm going to list all the components of people's reluctance to
start startups, and explain which are real.  Then would-be founders
can use this as a checklist to examine their own feelings.<br><br>I admit my goal is to increase your self-confidence.  But there are
two things different here from the usual confidence-building exercise.
One is that I'm motivated to be honest.  Most people in the
confidence-building business have already achieved their goal when
you buy the book or pay to attend the seminar where they tell you
how great you are.  Whereas if I encourage people to start startups
who shouldn't, I make my own life worse.  If I encourage too many
people to apply to Y Combinator, it just means more work for me,
because I have to read all the applications.<br><br>The other thing that's going to be different is my approach.  Instead
of being positive, I'm going to be negative.  Instead of telling
you "come on, you can do it" I'm going to consider all the reasons
you aren't doing it, and show why most (but not all) should be
ignored.  We'll start with the one everyone's born with.<br><br><b>1. Too young</b><br><br>A lot of people think they're too young to start a startup.  Many
are right.  The median age worldwide is about 27, so probably a
third of the population can truthfully say they're too young.<br><br>What's too young?  One of our goals with Y Combinator was to discover
the lower bound on the age of startup founders.  It always seemed
to us that investors were too conservative here—that they wanted
to fund professors, when really they should be funding grad students
or even undergrads.<br><br>The main thing we've discovered from pushing the edge of this
envelope is not where the edge is, but how fuzzy it is.  The outer
limit may be as low as 16.  We don't look beyond 18 because people
younger than that can't legally enter into contracts.  But the most
successful founder we've funded so far, Sam Altman, was 19 at the
time.<br><br>Sam Altman, however, is an outlying data point.  When he was 19,
he seemed like he had a 40 year old inside him.  There are other
19 year olds who are 12 inside.<br><br>There's a reason we have a distinct word "adult" for people over a
certain age.  There is a threshold you cross.  It's conventionally
fixed at 21, but different people cross it at greatly varying ages.
You're old enough to start a startup if you've crossed this threshold,
whatever your age.<br><br>How do you tell?  There are a couple tests adults use.  I realized
these tests existed after meeting Sam Altman, actually.  I noticed
that I felt like I was talking to someone much older.  Afterward I
wondered, what am I even measuring?  What made him seem older?<br><br>One test adults use is whether you still have the kid flake reflex.
When you're a little kid and you're asked to do something hard, you
can cry and say "I can't do it" and the adults will probably let
you off.  As a kid there's a magic button you can press by saying
"I'm just a kid" that will get you out of most difficult situations.
Whereas adults, by definition, are not allowed to flake.  They still
do, of course, but when they do they're ruthlessly pruned.<br><br>The other way to tell an adult is by how they react to a challenge.
Someone who's not yet an adult will tend to respond to a challenge
from an adult in a way that acknowledges their dominance.  If an
adult says "that's a stupid idea," a kid will either crawl away
with his tail between his legs, or rebel.  But rebelling presumes
inferiority as much as submission.  The adult response to
"that's a stupid idea," is simply to look the other person in the
eye and say "Really?  Why do you think so?"<br><br>There are a lot of adults who still react childishly to challenges,
of course.  What you don't often find are kids who react to challenges
like adults.  When you do, you've found an adult, whatever their
age.<br><br><b>2. Too inexperienced</b><br><br>I once wrote that startup founders should be at least 23, and that
people should work for another company for a few years before
starting their own.  I no longer believe that, and what changed my
mind is the example of the startups we've funded.<br><br>I still think 23 is a better age than 21.  But the best way to get
experience if you're 21 is to start a startup.  So, paradoxically,
if you're too inexperienced to start a startup, what you should do
is start one.  That's a way more efficient cure for inexperience
than a normal job.  In fact, getting a normal job may actually make
you less able to start a startup, by turning you into a tame animal
who thinks he needs an office to work in and a product manager to
tell him what software to write.<br><br>What really convinced me of this was the Kikos.  They started a
startup right out of college.  Their inexperience caused them to
make a lot of mistakes.  But by the time we funded their second
startup, a year later, they had become extremely formidable.  They
were certainly not tame animals.  And there is no way they'd have
grown so much if they'd spent that year working at Microsoft, or
even Google.  They'd still have been diffident junior programmers.<br><br>So now I'd advise people to go ahead and start startups right out
of college.  There's no better time to take risks than when you're
young.  Sure, you'll probably fail.  But even failure will get you
to the ultimate goal faster than getting a job.<br><br>It worries me a bit to be saying this, because in effect we're
advising people to educate themselves by failing at our expense,
but it's the truth.<br><br><b>3. Not determined enough</b><br><br>You need a lot of determination to succeed as a startup founder.
It's probably the single best predictor of success.<br><br>Some people may not be determined enough to make it.  It's
hard for me to say for sure, because I'm so determined that I can't
imagine what's going on in the heads of people who aren't.  But I
know they exist.<br><br>Most hackers probably underestimate their determination.  I've seen
a lot become visibly more determined as they get used to running a 
startup.  I can think of
several we've funded who would have been delighted at first to be
bought for $2 million, but are now set on world domination.<br><br>How can you tell if you're determined enough, when Larry and Sergey
themselves were unsure at first about starting a company?  I'm
guessing here, but I'd say the test is whether you're sufficiently
driven to work on your own projects.  Though they may have been
unsure whether they wanted to start a company, it doesn't seem as
if Larry and Sergey were meek little research assistants, obediently
doing their advisors' bidding.  They started projects of their own.<br><br>
<b>4. Not smart enough</b><br><br>You may need to be moderately smart to succeed as a startup founder.
But if you're worried about this, you're probably mistaken.  If
you're smart enough to worry that you might not be smart enough to
start a startup, you probably are.<br><br>And in any case, starting a startup just doesn't require that much
intelligence.  Some startups do.  You have to be good at math to
write Mathematica.  But most companies do more mundane stuff where
the decisive factor is effort, not brains.  Silicon Valley can warp
your perspective on this, because there's a cult of smartness here.
People who aren't smart at least try to act that way.  But if you
think it takes a lot of intelligence to get rich, try spending a
couple days in some of the fancier bits of New York or LA.<br><br>If you don't think you're smart enough to start a startup doing
something technically difficult, just write enterprise software.
Enterprise software companies aren't technology companies, they're
sales companies, and sales depends mostly on effort.<br><br><b>5. Know nothing about business</b><br><br>This is another variable whose coefficient should be zero.  You
don't need to know anything about business to start a startup.  The
initial focus should be the product.  All you need to know in this
phase is how to build things people want.  If you succeed, you'll
have to think about how to make money from it.  But this is so easy
you can pick it up on the fly.<br><br>I get a fair amount of flak for telling founders just to make
something great and not worry too much about making money.  And yet
all the empirical evidence points that way: pretty much 100% of
startups that make something popular manage to make money from it.
And acquirers tell me privately that revenue is not what they buy
startups for, but their strategic value.  Which means, because they
made something people want.  Acquirers know the rule holds for them
too: if users love you, you can always make money from that somehow,
and if they don't, the cleverest business model in the world won't
save you.<br><br>So why do so many people argue with me?  I think one reason is that
they hate the idea that a bunch of twenty year olds could get rich
from building something cool that doesn't make any money.  They
just don't want that to be possible.  But how possible it is doesn't
depend on how much they want it to be.<br><br>For a while it annoyed me to hear myself described as some kind of
irresponsible pied piper, leading impressionable young hackers down
the road to ruin.  But now I realize this kind of controversy is a
sign of a good idea.<br><br>The most valuable truths are the ones most people don't believe.
They're like undervalued stocks.  If you start with them, you'll
have the whole field to yourself.  So when you find an idea you
know is good but most people disagree with, you should not
merely ignore their objections, but push aggressively in that
direction.  In this case, that means you should seek out ideas that
would be popular but seem hard to make money from.<br><br>We'll bet a seed round you can't make something popular that we
can't figure out how to make money from.<br><br><b>6. No cofounder</b><br><br>Not having a cofounder is a real problem.  A startup is too much
for one person to bear.  And though we differ from other investors
on a lot of questions, we all agree on this.  All investors, without
exception, are more likely to fund you with a cofounder than without.<br><br>We've funded two single founders, but in both cases we suggested
their first priority should be to find a cofounder.  Both did.  But
we'd have preferred them to have cofounders before they applied.
It's not super hard to get a cofounder for a project that's just
been funded, and we'd rather have cofounders committed enough to
sign up for something super hard.<br><br>If you don't have a cofounder, what should you do?  Get one.  It's
more important than anything else.  If there's no one where you
live who wants to start a startup with you, move where there are
people who do.  If no one wants to work with you on your current
idea, switch to an idea people want to work on.<br><br>If you're still in school, you're surrounded by potential cofounders.
A few years out it gets harder to find them.  Not only do you have
a smaller pool to draw from, but most already have jobs, and perhaps
even families to support.  So if you had friends in college you
used to scheme about startups with, stay in touch with them as well
as you can.  That may help keep the dream alive.<br><br>It's possible you could meet a cofounder through something like a
user's group or a conference.  But I wouldn't be too optimistic.
You need to work with someone to know whether you want them as a
cofounder.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The real lesson to draw from this is not how to find a cofounder,
but that you should start startups when you're young and there are
lots of them around.<br><br><b>7. No idea</b><br><br>In a sense, it's not a problem if you don't have a good idea, because
most startups change their idea anyway.  In the average Y Combinator
startup, I'd guess 70% of the idea is new at the end of the
first three months.  Sometimes it's 100%.<br><br>In fact, we're so sure the founders are more important than the
initial idea that we're going to try something new this funding
cycle. We're going to let people apply with no idea at all.  If you
want, you can answer the question on the application form that asks
what you're going to do with "We have no idea."  If you seem really
good we'll accept you anyway.  We're confident we can sit down with
you and cook up some promising project.<br><br>Really this just codifies what we do already.  We put little weight
on the idea.  We ask mainly out of politeness.  The kind of question
on the application form that we really care about is the one where
we ask what cool things you've made.  If what you've made is version
one of a promising startup, so much the better, but the main thing
we care about is whether you're good at making things.  Being lead
developer of a popular open source project counts almost as much.<br><br>That solves the problem if you get funded by Y Combinator.  What
about in the general case?  Because in another sense, it is a problem
if you don't have an idea.  If you start a startup with no idea,
what do you do next?<br><br>So here's the brief recipe for getting startup ideas.  Find something
that's missing in your own life, and supply that need—no matter
how specific to you it seems.  Steve Wozniak built himself a computer;
who knew so many other people would want them?  A need that's narrow
but genuine is a better starting point than one that's broad but
hypothetical.  So even if the problem is simply that you don't have
a date on Saturday night, if you can think of a way to fix that by
writing software, you're onto something, because a lot of other
people have the same problem.<br><br><b>8. No room for more startups</b><br><br>A lot of people look at the ever-increasing number of startups and
think "this can't continue."  Implicit in their thinking is a
fallacy: that there is some limit on the number of startups there
could be.  But this is false.  No one claims there's any limit on
the number of people who can work for salary at 1000-person companies.
Why should there be any limit on the number who can work for equity
at 5-person companies? 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Nearly everyone who works is satisfying some kind of need.  Breaking
up companies into smaller units doesn't make those needs go away.
Existing needs would probably get satisfied more efficiently by a
network of startups than by a few giant, hierarchical organizations,
but I don't think that would mean less opportunity, because satisfying
current needs would lead to more.  Certainly this tends to be the
case in individuals.  Nor is there anything wrong with that.  We
take for granted things that medieval kings would have considered
effeminate luxuries, like whole buildings heated to spring temperatures
year round.  And if things go well, our descendants will take for
granted things we would consider shockingly luxurious.  There is
no absolute standard for material wealth.  Health care is a component
of it, and that alone is a black hole.  For the foreseeable future,
people will want ever more material wealth, so there is no limit
to the amount of work available for companies, and for startups in
particular.<br><br>Usually the limited-room fallacy is not expressed directly.  Usually
it's implicit in statements like "there are only so many startups
Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo can buy."  Maybe, though the list of
acquirers is a lot longer than that.  And whatever you think of
other acquirers, Google is not stupid.  The reason big companies
buy startups is that they've created something valuable.  And why
should there be any limit to the number of valuable startups companies
can acquire, any more than there is a limit to the amount of wealth
individual people want?  Maybe there would be practical limits on
the number of startups any one acquirer could assimilate, but if
there is value to be had, in the form of upside that founders are
willing to forgo in return for an immediate payment, acquirers will
evolve to consume it.  Markets are pretty smart that way.<br><br><b>9. Family to support</b><br><br>This one is real.  I wouldn't advise anyone with a family to start
a startup.  I'm not saying it's a bad idea, just that I don't want
to take responsibility for advising it.  I'm willing to take
responsibility for telling 22 year olds to start startups.  So what
if they fail?  They'll learn a lot, and that job at Microsoft will
still be waiting for them if they need it.  But I'm not prepared
to cross moms.<br><br>What you can do, if you have a family and want to start a startup,
is start a consulting business you can then gradually turn into a
product business.  Empirically the chances of pulling that off seem
very small. You're never going to produce Google this way.  But at
least you'll never be without an income.<br><br>Another way to decrease the risk is to join an existing startup
instead of starting your own.  Being one of the first employees of
a startup is a lot like being a founder, in both the good ways and
the bad.  You'll be roughly 1/n^2 founder, where n is your employee
number.<br><br>As with the question of cofounders, the real lesson here is to start
startups when you're young.<br><br><b>10. Independently wealthy</b><br><br>This is my excuse for not starting a startup.  Startups are stressful.
Why do it if you don't need the money?  For every "serial entrepreneur,"
there are probably twenty sane ones who think "Start another
company?  Are you crazy?"<br><br>I've come close to starting new startups a couple times, but I
always pull back because I don't want four years of my life to be
consumed by random schleps.  I know this business well enough to
know you can't do it half-heartedly.  What makes a good startup
founder so dangerous is his willingness to endure infinite schleps.<br><br>There is a bit of a problem with retirement, though.  Like a lot
of people, I like to work.  And one of the many weird little problems
you discover when you get rich is that a lot of the interesting
people you'd like to work with are not rich.  They need to work at
something that pays the bills.  Which means if you want to have
them as colleagues, you have to work at something that pays the
bills too, even though you don't need to.  I think this is what
drives a lot of serial entrepreneurs, actually.<br><br>That's why I love working on Y Combinator so much.  It's an excuse
to work on something interesting with people I like.<br><br><b>11.  Not ready for commitment</b><br><br>This was my reason for not starting a startup for most of my twenties.
Like a lot of people that age, I valued freedom most of all.  I was
reluctant to do anything that required a commitment of more than a
few months.  Nor would I have wanted to do anything that completely
took over my life the way a startup does.  And that's fine.  If you
want to spend your time travelling around, or playing in a band,
or whatever, that's a perfectly legitimate reason not to start a
company.<br><br>If you start a startup that succeeds, it's going to consume at least
three or four years.  (If it fails, you'll be done a lot quicker.)
So you shouldn't do it if you're not ready for commitments on that
scale.  Be aware, though, that if you get a regular job, you'll
probably end up working there for as long as a startup would take,
and you'll find you have much less spare time than you might expect.
So if you're ready to clip on that ID badge and go to that orientation
session, you may also be ready to start that startup.<br><br><b>12.  Need for structure</b><br><br>I'm told there are people who need structure in their lives.  This
seems to be a nice way of saying they need someone to tell them
what to do.  I believe such people exist.  There's plenty of empirical
evidence: armies, religious cults, and so on.  They may even be the
majority.<br><br>If you're one of these people, you probably shouldn't start a
startup.  In fact, you probably shouldn't even go to work for one.
In a good startup, you don't get told what to do very much.  There
may be one person whose job title is CEO, but till the company has
about twelve people no one should be telling anyone what to do.
That's too inefficient.  Each person should just do what they need
to without anyone telling them.<br><br>If that sounds like a recipe for chaos, think about a soccer team.
Eleven people manage to work together in quite complicated ways,
and yet only in occasional emergencies does anyone tell anyone else
what to do.  A reporter once asked David Beckham if there were any
language problems at Real Madrid, since the players were from about
eight different countries.  He said it was never an issue, because
everyone was so good they never had to talk.  They all just did the
right thing.<br><br>How do you tell if you're independent-minded enough to start a
startup?  If you'd bristle at the suggestion that you aren't, then
you probably are.<br><br><b>13. Fear of uncertainty</b><br><br>Perhaps some people are deterred from starting startups because
they don't like the uncertainty.  If you go to work for Microsoft,
you can predict fairly accurately what the next few years will be
like—all too accurately, in fact.  If you start a startup, anything
might happen.<br><br>Well, if you're troubled by uncertainty, I can solve that problem
for you: if you start a startup, it will probably fail.  Seriously, 
though, this is not a bad way to think
about the whole experience.  Hope for the best, but expect the
worst.  In the worst case, it will at least be interesting.  In the
best case you might get rich.<br><br>No one will blame you if the startup tanks, so long as you made a
serious effort.  There may once have been a time when employers
would regard that as a mark against you, but they wouldn't now.  I
asked managers at big companies, and they all said they'd prefer
to hire someone who'd tried to start a startup and failed over
someone who'd spent the same time working at a big company.<br><br>Nor will investors hold it against you, as long as you didn't fail
out of laziness or incurable stupidity.   I'm told there's a lot
of stigma attached to failing in other places—in Europe, for
example.  Not here.  In America, companies, like practically
everything else, are disposable.<br><br><b>14. Don't realize what you're avoiding</b><br><br>One reason people who've been out in the world for a year or two
make better founders than people straight from college is that they
know what they're avoiding.  If their startup fails, they'll have
to get a job, and they know how much jobs suck.<br><br>If you've had summer jobs in college, you may think you know what
jobs are like, but you probably don't.  Summer jobs at technology
companies are not real jobs.  If you get a summer job as a waiter,
that's a real job.  Then you have to carry your weight.  But software
companies don't hire students for the summer as a source of cheap
labor.  They do it in the hope of recruiting them when they graduate.
So while they're happy if you produce, they don't expect you to.<br><br>That will change if you get a real job after you graduate.  Then
you'll have to earn your keep.  And since most of what big companies
do is boring, you're going to have to work on boring stuff.  Easy,
compared to college, but boring.  At first it may seem cool to get
paid for doing easy stuff, after paying to do hard stuff in college.
But that wears off after a few months.  Eventually it gets demoralizing
to work on dumb stuff, even if it's easy and you get paid a lot.<br><br>And that's not the worst of it.  The thing that really sucks about
having a regular job is the expectation that you're supposed to be
there at certain times.  Even Google is afflicted with this,
apparently.  And what this means, as everyone who's had a regular
job can tell you, is that there are going to be times when you have
absolutely no desire to work on anything, and you're going to have
to go to work anyway and sit in front of your screen and pretend
to.  To someone who likes work, as most good hackers do, this is
torture.<br><br>In a startup, you skip all that.  There's no concept of office hours
in most startups.  Work and life just get mixed together.  But the
good thing about that is that no one minds if you have a life at
work.  In a startup you can do whatever you want most of the time.
If you're a founder, what you want to do most of the time is work.
But you never have to pretend to.<br><br>If you took a nap in your office in a big company, it would seem
unprofessional.  But if you're starting a startup and you fall
asleep in the middle of the day, your cofounders will just assume
you were tired.<br><br><b>15. Parents want you to be a doctor</b><br><br>A significant number of would-be startup founders are probably
dissuaded from doing it by their parents.  I'm not going to say you
shouldn't listen to them.  Families are entitled to their own
traditions, and who am I to argue with them?  But I will give you
a couple reasons why a safe career might not be what your parents
really want for you.<br><br>One is that parents tend to be more conservative for their kids
than they would be for themselves.  This is actually a rational
response to their situation.  Parents end up sharing more of their
kids' ill fortune than good fortune.  Most parents don't mind this;
it's part of the job; but it does tend to make them excessively
conservative.  And erring on the side of conservatism is still
erring.  In almost everything, reward is proportionate to risk.  So
by protecting their kids from risk, parents are, without realizing
it, also protecting them from rewards.  If they saw that, they'd
want you to take more risks.<br><br>The other reason parents may be mistaken is that, like generals,
they're always fighting the last war.  If they want you to be a
doctor, odds are it's not just because they want you to help the
sick, but also because it's a prestigious and lucrative career.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
But not so lucrative or prestigious as it was when their
opinions were formed.  When I was a kid in the seventies, a doctor
was <i>the</i> thing to be.  There was a sort of golden triangle involving
doctors, Mercedes 450SLs, and tennis.  All three vertices now seem
pretty dated.<br><br>The parents who want you to be a doctor may simply not realize how
much things have changed.  Would they be that unhappy if you were
Steve Jobs instead?  So I think the way to deal with your parents'
opinions about what you should do is to treat them like feature
requests.  Even if your only goal is to please them, the way to do
that is not simply to give them what they ask for.  Instead think
about why they're asking for something, and see if there's a better
way to give them what they need.<br><br><b>16.  A job is the default</b><br><br>This leads us to the last and probably most powerful reason people
get regular jobs: it's the default thing to do.  Defaults are
enormously powerful, precisely because they operate without any
conscious choice.<br><br>To almost everyone except criminals, it seems an axiom that if you
need money, you should get a job.  Actually this tradition is not
much more than a hundred years old.  Before that, the default way
to make a living was by farming.  It's a bad plan to treat something
only a hundred years old as an axiom.  By historical standards,
that's something that's changing pretty rapidly.<br><br>We may be seeing another such change right now.  I've read a lot
of economic history, and I understand the startup world pretty well,
and it now seems to me fairly likely that we're seeing the beginning
of a change like the one from farming to manufacturing.<br><br>And you know what?  If you'd been around when that change began
(around 1000 in Europe) it would have seemed to nearly everyone
that running off to the city to make your fortune was a crazy thing
to do.  Though serfs were in principle forbidden to leave their
manors, it can't have been that hard to run away to a city.  There
were no guards patrolling the perimeter of the village.  What
prevented most serfs from leaving was that it seemed insanely risky.
Leave one's plot of land?  Leave the people you'd spent your whole
life with, to live in a giant city of three or four thousand complete
strangers?  How would you live?  How would you get food, if you
didn't grow it?<br><br>Frightening as it seemed to them, it's now the default with us to
live by our wits.  So if it seems risky to you to start a startup,
think how risky it once seemed to your ancestors to live as we do
now.  Oddly enough, the people who know this best are the very ones
trying to get you to stick to the old model.  How can Larry and
Sergey say you should come work as their employee, when they didn't
get jobs themselves?<br><br>Now we look back on medieval peasants and wonder how they stood it.
How grim it must have been to till the same fields your whole life
with no hope of anything better, under the thumb of lords and priests
you had to give all your surplus to and acknowledge as your masters.
I wouldn't be surprised if one day people look back on what we
consider a normal job in the same way.  How grim it would be to
commute every day to a cubicle in some soulless office complex, and
be told what to do by someone you had to acknowledge as a boss—someone 
who could call you into their office and say "take a seat,"
and you'd sit!  Imagine having to ask <i>permission</i> to release
software to users.  Imagine being sad on Sunday afternoons because
the weekend was almost over, and tomorrow you'd have to get up and
go to work.  How did they stand it?<br><br>It's exciting to think we may be on the cusp of another shift like
the one from farming to manufacturing.  That's why I care about
startups.  Startups aren't interesting just because they're a way
to make a lot of money.  I couldn't care less about other ways to
do that, like speculating in securities.  At most those are interesting
the way puzzles are.  There's more going on with startups.  They
may represent one of those rare, historic shifts in the way 
<a href="wealth.html">wealth</a> is created.<br><br>That's ultimately what drives us to work on Y Combinator.  We want
to make money, if only so we don't have to stop doing it, but that's
not the main goal.  There have only been a handful of these great
economic shifts in human history.  It would be an amazing hack to
make one happen faster.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]

The best kind of organization for that might be an open source
project, but those don't involve a lot of face to face meetings.
Maybe it would be worth starting one that did.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
There need to be some number of big companies to acquire the
startups, so the number of big companies couldn't decrease to zero.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Thought experiment: If doctors did the same work, but as
impoverished outcasts, which parents would still want their kids
to be doctors?<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert

I was talking
to a young startup founder about how Google was different from
Yahoo.  I said that Yahoo had been warped from the start by
their fear of Microsoft.  That was why they'd positioned themselves
as a "media company" instead of a technology company.  Then I looked
at his face and realized he didn't understand.  It was as if I'd
told him how much girls liked Barry Manilow in the mid
80s.  Barry who?<br><br>Microsoft?  He didn't say anything, but I could tell he didn't quite
believe anyone would be frightened of them.<br><br>Microsoft cast
a shadow over the software world for almost 20 years
starting in the late 80s.
I can remember when it was IBM before them.  I mostly ignored this
shadow.  I never used Microsoft software, so it only affected me
indirectly—for example, in the spam I got from botnets.  And
because I wasn't paying attention, I didn't notice when the shadow
disappeared.<br><br>But it's gone now.  I can sense that.  No one is even afraid of
Microsoft anymore.  They still make a lot of money—so does IBM,
for that matter.  But they're not dangerous.<br><br>When did Microsoft die, and of what?  I know they seemed dangerous
as late as 2001, because I wrote an <a href="road.html">essay</a> then 
about how they were
less dangerous than they seemed.   I'd guess they were dead by 2005.
I know when we started Y Combinator we didn't worry about Microsoft
as competition for the startups we funded.  In fact, we've never
even invited them to the demo days we organize for startups to
present to investors.  We invite Yahoo and Google and some other
Internet companies, but we've never bothered to invite Microsoft.
Nor has anyone there ever even sent us an email.  They're in a
different world.<br><br>What killed them?  Four things, I think, all of them occurring
simultaneously in the mid 2000s.<br><br>The most obvious is Google.  There can only be one big man in town,
and they're clearly it.  Google is the most dangerous company
now by far, in both the good and bad senses of the word.  Microsoft
can at best <a href="http://live.com">limp</a> along afterward.<br><br>When did Google take the lead?  There will be a tendency to push
it back to their IPO in August 2004, but they weren't setting the
terms of the debate then.  I'd say they took the lead in
2005.  Gmail was one of the things that put them over the edge.
Gmail showed they could do more than search.<br><br>Gmail also showed how much you could do with web-based software,
if you took advantage of what later came to be called "Ajax." And
that was the second cause of Microsoft's death: everyone can see the
desktop is over.  It now seems inevitable that applications will
live on the web—not just email, but everything, right up to
<a href="http://snipshot.com">Photoshop</a>.  Even Microsoft sees that now.<br><br>Ironically, Microsoft unintentionally helped create Ajax.  The x
in Ajax is from the XMLHttpRequest object, which lets the browser
communicate with the server in the background while displaying a page.
(Originally the only way to communicate with the server was to 
ask for a new page.) XMLHttpRequest was created by Microsoft in the late 90s
because they needed it for Outlook.  What they didn't realize was
that it would be useful to a lot of other people too—in fact, to
anyone who wanted to make web apps work like desktop ones.<br><br>The other critical component of Ajax is Javascript, the programming
language that runs in the browser.  Microsoft saw the danger of
Javascript and tried to keep it broken for as long as they could.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font> 
But eventually the open source world won, by producing
Javascript libraries that grew over the brokenness of Explorer
the way a tree grows over barbed wire.<br><br>The third cause of Microsoft's death was broadband Internet.  Anyone
who cares can have fast Internet access
now.  And the bigger the pipe to the server, the less you need the
desktop.<br><br>The last nail in the coffin came, of all places, from Apple.  
Thanks to OS X, Apple has come back from the dead in a way
that is extremely rare in technology.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>
Their victory is so complete that I'm now surprised when I come across
a computer running Windows.  Nearly all the people we fund at Y
Combinator use Apple laptops.  It was the same in the audience at 
<a href="http://www.bosstalks.com/StartupSchool2007/all_macs_and_all_writing.jpg">startup
school</a>.  All the computer people use Macs or Linux now.  Windows is for
grandmas, like Macs used to be in the 90s.  So not only does the
desktop no longer matter, no one who cares about computers uses
Microsoft's anyway.<br><br>And of course Apple has Microsoft on the run in music
too, with TV and phones on the way.<br><br>I'm glad Microsoft is dead.  They were like Nero or 
Commodus—evil
in the way only inherited power can make you.  Because remember,
the Microsoft monopoly didn't begin with Microsoft.  They got it
from IBM.  The software business was overhung by a
monopoly from about the mid-1950s to about 2005.  For practically
its whole existence, that is.  One of the reasons "Web 2.0" has
such an air of euphoria about it is the feeling, conscious or not,
that this era of monopoly may finally be over.<br><br>Of course, as a hacker I can't help thinking about how something
broken could be fixed.  Is there some way Microsoft could come back?
In principle, yes.  To see how, envision two things: (a) the amount
of cash Microsoft now has on hand, and (b) Larry and Sergey making
the rounds of all the search engines ten years ago trying to sell
the idea for Google for a million dollars, and being turned down
by everyone.<br><br>The surprising fact is, brilliant hackers—dangerously brilliant
hackers—can be had very cheaply, by the standards of a
company as rich as Microsoft.  They can't 
<a href="hiring.html">hire</a> smart people anymore,
but they could buy as many as they wanted for only an order of magnitude 
more. So if they wanted to be a contender
again, this is how they could do it:
<ol>
<li> Buy all the good "Web 2.0" startups.  They could get substantially
    all of them for less than they'd have to pay for Facebook.<br><br></li><li> Put them all in a building in Silicon Valley, surrounded by
    lead shielding to protect them from any contact with Redmond.
</li></ol>
I feel safe suggesting this, because they'd never do it.  Microsoft's
biggest weakness is that they still don't realize how much they
suck.  They still think they can write software in house.  Maybe they
can, by the standards of the desktop world.  But that world ended
a few years ago.<br><br>I already know what the reaction to this essay will be.  Half the
readers will say that Microsoft is still an enormously profitable
company, and that I should be more
careful about drawing conclusions based on what a few people think
in our insular little "Web 2.0" bubble.  The other half, the younger
half, will complain that this is old news.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>See also:</b> <a href="cliffsnotes.html">Microsoft is Dead: the Cliffs Notes</a><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
It doesn't take a conscious effort to make software incompatible.
All you have to do is not work too hard at fixing bugs—which, if
you're a big company, you produce in copious quantities.  The
situation is analogous to the writing of "<ax href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=subtext+gendered+theory+postmodern+deconstruct">literary
theorists."  Most don't try to be obscure; they just don't make an
effort to be clear.  It wouldn't pay.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In part because Steve Jobs got pushed out by John Sculley in
a way that's rare among technology companies.  If Apple's board
hadn't made that blunder, they wouldn't have had to bounce back.<br><br></ax></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><a href="http://www.dicas-l.com.br/zonadecombate/zonadecombate_20070417.php">Portuguese Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><a href="http://flyingapplet.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!F682AFBD82F7E261!555.entry">Simplified Chinese Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><a href="http://appledelhi.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/">Korean Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><br><br></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><div><div><div></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></div><div><br><br><div><h1 id="judgement">Two Kinds of Judgement</h1><br><br>April 2007<br><br>There are two different ways people judge you.  Sometimes judging
you correctly is the end goal.  But there's a second much more
common type of judgement where it isn't.  We tend to regard all
judgements of us as the first type.  We'd probably be happier if
we realized which are and which aren't.<br><br>The first type of judgement, the type where judging you is the end
goal, include court cases, grades in classes, and most competitions.
Such judgements can of course be mistaken, but because the goal is
to judge you correctly, there's usually some kind of appeals process.
If you feel you've been misjudged, you can protest that you've been
treated unfairly.<br><br>Nearly all the judgements made on children are of this type, so we
get into the habit early in life of thinking that all judgements
are.<br><br>But in fact there is a second much larger class of judgements where
judging you is only a means to something else.  These include college
admissions, hiring and investment decisions, and of course the
judgements made in dating.  This kind of judgement is not really
about you.<br><br>Put yourself in the position of someone selecting players for a
national team.  Suppose for the sake of simplicity that this is a
game with no positions, and that you have to select 20 players.
There will be a few stars who clearly should make the team, and
many players who clearly shouldn't.  The only place your judgement
makes a difference is in the borderline cases.  Suppose you screw
up and underestimate the 20th best player, causing him not to make
the team, and his place to be taken by the 21st best.  You've still
picked a good team.  If the players have the usual distribution of
ability, the 21st best player will be only slightly worse than the
20th best.  Probably the difference between them will be less than
the measurement error.<br><br>The 20th best player may feel he has been misjudged.  But your goal
here wasn't to provide a service estimating people's ability.  It
was to pick a team, and if the difference between the 20th and 21st
best players is less than the measurement error, you've still done
that optimally.<br><br>It's a false analogy even to use the word unfair to describe this
kind of misjudgement.  It's not aimed at producing a correct estimate
of any given individual, but at selecting a reasonably optimal set.<br><br>One thing that leads us astray here is that the selector seems to
be in a position of power.  That makes him seem like a judge.  If
you regard someone judging you as a customer instead of a judge,
the expectation of fairness goes away.  The author of a good novel
wouldn't complain that readers were <i>unfair</i> for preferring a
potboiler with a racy cover.  Stupid, perhaps, but not unfair.<br><br>Our early training and our self-centeredness combine to make us
believe that every judgement of us is about us.  In fact most aren't.
This is a rare case where being less self-centered will make people
more confident.  Once you realize how little most people judging
you care about judging you accurately—once you realize that because
of the normal distribution of most applicant pools, it matters least
to judge accurately in precisely the cases where judgement has the
most effect—you won't take rejection so personally.<br><br>And curiously enough, taking rejection less personally may help you
to get rejected less often.  If you think someone judging you will
work hard to judge you correctly, you can afford to be passive.
But the more you realize that most judgements are greatly influenced
by random, extraneous factors—that most people judging you are
more like a fickle novel buyer than a wise and perceptive 
magistrate—the more you realize you can do things to influence the
outcome.<br><br>One good place to apply this principle is in college applications.
Most high school students applying to college do it with the usual
child's mix of inferiority and self-centeredness: inferiority in
that they assume that admissions committees must be all-seeing;
self-centeredness in that they assume admissions committees care
enough about them to dig down into their application and figure out
whether they're good or not.  These combine to make applicants
passive in applying and hurt when they're rejected.  If college
applicants realized how quick and impersonal most selection processes
are, they'd make more effort to sell themselves, and take the outcome
less personally.<br><br></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><a href="http://www.simpleoption.com/empresa/ensayo-dos-tipos-juicios">Spanish Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><a href="http://ryba4.com/translations/judgement">Russian Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><a href="https://tldrarabiccontents.blogspot.com/2020/02/blog-post_5.html">Arabic Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><br><br></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

at Stanford.)</i><br><br>The world of investors is a foreign one to most hackers—partly
because investors are so unlike hackers, and partly because they
tend to operate in secret.  I've been dealing with this world for
many years, both as a founder and an investor, and I still don't
fully understand it.<br><br>In this essay I'm going to list some of the more surprising things
I've learned about investors.  Some I only learned in the past year.<br><br>Teaching hackers how to deal with investors is probably the second
most important thing we do at Y Combinator.  The most important
thing for a startup is to make something good.  But everyone knows
that's important.  The dangerous thing about investors is that
hackers don't know how little they know about this strange world.<br><br><b>1. The investors are what make a startup hub.</b><br><br>About a year ago I tried to figure out what you'd need to reproduce
<a href="siliconvalley.html">Silicon Valley</a>.  I decided the 
critical ingredients were rich people
and nerds—investors and founders.  People are all you need to
make technology, and all the other people will move.<br><br>If I had to narrow that down, I'd say investors are the limiting
factor.  Not because they contribute more to the startup, but simply
because they're least willing to move.  They're rich.  They're not
going to move to Albuquerque just because there are some smart
hackers there they could invest in.  Whereas hackers will move to
the Bay Area to find investors.<br><br><b>2. Angel investors are the most critical.</b><br><br>There are several types of investors.  The two main categories are
angels and VCs: VCs invest other people's money, and angels invest
their own.<br><br>Though they're less well known, the angel investors are probably
the more critical ingredient in creating a silicon valley.  Most
companies that VCs invest in would never have made it that far if angels
hadn't invested first.  VCs say between half and three quarters of
companies that raise series A rounds have taken some outside
investment already.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Angels are willing to fund riskier projects than VCs.  They also
give valuable advice, because (unlike VCs) many have been startup
founders themselves.<br><br>Google's story shows the key role angels play. A lot of people know
Google raised money from Kleiner and Sequoia.  What most don't realize
is how late.  That VC round was a series B round; the premoney
valuation was $75 million.  Google was already a successful company
at that point.  Really, Google was funded with angel money.<br><br>It may seem odd that the canonical Silicon Valley startup was funded
by angels, but this is not so surprising.  Risk is always proportionate
to reward.  So the most successful startup of all is likely to have
seemed an extremely risky bet at first, and that is exactly the
kind VCs won't touch.<br><br>Where do angel investors come from?  From other startups.  So startup
hubs like Silicon Valley benefit from something like the marketplace
effect, but shifted in time: startups are there because startups
were there.<br><br><b>3. Angels don't like publicity.</b><br><br>If angels are so important, why do we hear more about VCs?  Because
VCs like publicity.  They need to market themselves to the investors
who are their "customers"—the endowments and pension funds and
rich families whose money they invest—and also to founders who
might come to them for funding.<br><br>Angels don't need to market themselves to investors because they
invest their own money.  Nor do they want to market themselves to
founders: they don't want random people pestering them with business
plans.  Actually, neither do VCs.  Both angels and VCs get deals
almost exclusively through personal introductions.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The reason VCs want a strong brand is not to draw in more business
plans over the transom, but so they win deals when competing
against other VCs.  Whereas angels are rarely in direct competition,
because (a) they do fewer deals, (b) they're happy to split them,
and (c) they invest at a point where the stream is broader.<br><br><b>4. Most investors, especially VCs, are not like founders.</b><br><br>Some angels are, or were, hackers.  But most VCs are a different
type of people: they're dealmakers.<br><br>If you're a hacker, here's a thought experiment you can run to
understand why there are basically no hacker VCs: How would you
like a job where you never got to make anything, but instead spent
all your time listening to other people pitch (mostly terrible)
projects, deciding whether to fund them, and sitting on their boards
if you did?  That would not be fun for most hackers.  Hackers like
to make things.  This would be like being an administrator.<br><br>Because most VCs are a different species of people from
founders, it's hard to know what they're thinking.  If you're a
hacker, the last time you had to deal with these guys was in high
school.  Maybe in college you walked past their fraternity on your
way to the lab.  But don't underestimate them.  They're as expert
in their world as you are in yours.  What they're good at is reading
people, and making deals work to their advantage.  Think twice
before you try to beat them at that.<br><br><b>5. Most investors are momentum investors.</b><br><br>Because most investors are dealmakers rather than technology people,
they generally don't understand what you're doing.  I knew as a
founder that most VCs didn't get technology.  I also knew some made
a lot of money.  And yet it never occurred to me till recently to
put those two ideas together and ask "How can VCs make money by
investing in stuff they don't understand?"<br><br>The answer is that they're like momentum investors.  You can (or
could once) make a lot of money by noticing sudden changes in stock
prices.  When a stock jumps upward, you buy, and when it suddenly
drops, you sell.  In effect you're insider trading, without knowing
what you know.  You just know someone knows something, and that's
making the stock move.<br><br>This is how most venture investors operate.  They don't try to look
at something and predict whether it will take off.  They win by
noticing that something <i>is</i> taking off a little sooner than everyone
else.  That generates almost as good returns as actually being able
to pick winners.  They may have to pay a little more than they would
if they got in at the very beginning, but only a little.<br><br>Investors always say what they really care about is the team.
Actually what they care most about is your traffic, then what other
investors think, then the team.  If you don't yet have any traffic,
they fall back on number 2, what other investors think.  And this,
as you can imagine, produces wild oscillations in the "stock price"
of a startup.  One week everyone wants you, and they're begging not
to be cut out of the deal.  But all it takes is for one big investor
to cool on you, and the next week no one will return your phone
calls.  We regularly have startups go from hot to cold or cold to
hot in a matter of days, and literally nothing has changed.<br><br>There are two ways to deal with this phenomenon.  If you're feeling
really confident, you can try to ride it.  You can start by asking
a comparatively lowly VC for a small amount of money, and then after
generating interest there, ask more prestigious VCs for larger
amounts, stirring up a crescendo of buzz, and then "sell" at the
top.  This is extremely risky, and takes months even if you succeed.
I wouldn't try it myself.  My advice is to err on the side of safety:
when someone offers you a decent deal, just take it and get on with
building the company.  Startups win or lose based on the quality
of their product, not the quality of their funding deals.<br><br><b>6. Most investors are looking for big hits.</b><br><br>Venture investors like companies that could go public.  That's where
the big returns are.  They know the odds of any individual startup
going public are small, but they want to invest in those that at
least have a <i>chance</i> of going public.<br><br>Currently the way VCs seem to operate is to invest in a bunch of
companies, most of which fail, and one of which is Google.  Those
few big wins compensate for losses on their other investments.  What this
means is that most VCs will only invest in you if you're a potential
Google.  They don't care about companies that are a safe bet to be
acquired for $20 million.  There needs to be a chance, however
small, of the company becoming really big.<br><br>Angels are different in this respect.  They're happy to invest in
a company where the most likely outcome is a $20 million acquisition
if they can do it at a low enough valuation.  But of course they
like companies that could go public too.  So having an ambitious
long-term plan pleases everyone.<br><br>If you take VC money, you have to mean it, because the structure
of VC deals prevents early acquisitions.  If you take VC money,
they won't let you sell early.<br><br><b>7. VCs want to invest large amounts.</b><br><br>The fact that they're running investment funds makes VCs want to
invest large amounts.  A typical VC fund is now hundreds of millions
of dollars.  If $400 million has to be invested by 10 partners,
they have to invest $40 million each.  VCs usually sit on the boards
of companies they fund.  If the average deal size was $1 million,
each partner would have to sit on 40 boards, which would not be
fun.  So they prefer bigger deals, where they can put a lot of money
to work at once.<br><br>VCs don't regard you as a bargain if you don't need a lot of money.
That may even make you less attractive, because it means their
investment creates less of a barrier to entry for competitors.<br><br>Angels are in a different position because they're investing their
own money.  They're happy to invest small amounts—sometimes as
little as $20,000—as long as the potential returns look good
enough.  So if you're doing something inexpensive, go to angels.<br><br><b>8. Valuations are fiction.</b><br><br>VCs admit that valuations are an artifact.  They decide how much
money you need and how much of the company they want, and those two
constraints yield a valuation.<br><br>Valuations increase as the size of the investment does.  A company
that an angel is willing to put $50,000 into at a valuation of a
million can't take $6 million from VCs at that valuation.  That
would leave the founders less than a seventh of the company between
them (since the option pool would also come out of that seventh).
Most VCs wouldn't want that, which is why you never hear of deals
where a VC invests $6 million at a premoney valuation of $1 million.<br><br>If valuations change depending on the amount invested, that shows
how far they are from reflecting any kind of value of the company.<br><br>Since valuations are made up, founders shouldn't care too much about
them.  That's not the part to focus on.  In fact, a high valuation
can be a bad thing.  If you take funding at a premoney valuation
of $10 million, you won't be selling the company for 20.  You'll
have to sell for over 50 for the VCs to get even a 5x return, which
is low to them.  More likely they'll want you to hold out for 100.
But needing to get a high price decreases the chance of getting
bought at all; many companies can buy you for $10 million, but only
a handful for 100.  And since a startup is like a pass/fail course
for the founders, what you want to optimize is your chance of a
good outcome, not the percentage of the company you keep.<br><br>So why do founders chase high valuations?  They're tricked by
misplaced ambition.  They feel they've achieved more if they get a
higher valuation.  They usually know other founders, and if they
get a higher valuation they can say "mine is bigger than yours."
But funding is not the real test.  The real test is the final outcome
for the founder, and getting too high a valuation may just make a
good outcome less likely.<br><br>The one advantage of a high valuation is that you get less dilution.
But there is another less sexy way to achieve that: just take less
money.<br><br><b>9. Investors look for founders like the current stars.</b><br><br>Ten years ago investors were looking for the next Bill Gates.  This
was a mistake, because Microsoft was a very anomalous startup.  They
started almost as a contract programming operation, and the reason
they became huge was that IBM happened to drop the PC standard in
their lap.<br><br>Now all the VCs are looking for the next Larry and Sergey.  This
is a good trend, because Larry and Sergey are closer to the ideal
startup founders.<br><br>Historically investors thought it was important for a founder to
be an expert in business.  So they were willing to fund teams of
MBAs who planned to use the money to pay programmers to build their
product for them.  This is like funding Steve Ballmer in the hope
that the programmer he'll hire is Bill Gates—kind of backward,
as the events of the Bubble showed.  Now most VCs know they should
be funding technical guys.  This is more pronounced among the very
top funds; the lamer ones still want to fund MBAs.<br><br>If you're a hacker, it's good news that investors are looking for
Larry and Sergey.  The bad news is, the only investors who can do
it right are the ones who knew them when they were a
couple of CS grad students, not the confident media stars they are
today.  What investors still don't get is how clueless and tentative
great founders can seem at the very beginning.<br><br><b>10. The contribution of investors tends to be underestimated.</b><br><br>Investors do more for startups than give them money.  They're helpful
in doing deals and arranging introductions, and some of the smarter
ones, particularly angels, can give good advice about the product.<br><br>In fact, I'd say what separates the great investors from the mediocre
ones is the quality of their advice.  Most investors give advice,
but the top ones give <i>good</i> advice.<br><br>Whatever help investors give a startup tends to be underestimated.
It's to everyone's advantage to let the world think the founders
thought of everything.  The goal of the investors is for the company
to become valuable, and the company seems more valuable if it seems
like all the good ideas came from within.<br><br>This trend is compounded by the obsession that the press has with
founders.  In a company founded by two people, 10% of the ideas
might come from the first guy they hire.  Arguably they've done a
bad job of hiring otherwise.  And yet this guy will be almost
entirely overlooked by the press.<br><br>I say this as a founder: the contribution of founders is always
overestimated.  The danger here is that new founders, looking at
existing founders, will think that they're supermen that one couldn't
possibly equal oneself.  Actually they have a hundred different
types of support people just offscreen making the whole show possible.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>11. VCs are afraid of looking bad.</b><br><br>I've been very surprised to discover how timid most VCs are.  They
seem to be afraid of looking bad to their partners, and perhaps
also to the limited partners—the people whose money they invest.<br><br>You can measure this fear in how much less risk VCs are willing to
take.  You can tell they won't make investments for their fund that
they might be willing to make themselves as angels.  Though it's
not quite accurate to say that VCs are less willing to take risks.
They're less willing to do things that might look bad.  That's not
the same thing.<br><br>For example, most VCs would be very reluctant to invest in a startup
founded by a pair of 18 year old hackers, no matter how brilliant,
because if the startup failed their partners could turn on them and
say "What, you invested $x million of our money in a pair of 18
year olds?"  Whereas if a VC invested in a startup founded by
three former banking executives in their 40s who planned to outsource
their product development—which to my mind is actually a lot
riskier than investing in a pair of really smart 18 year olds—he
couldn't be faulted, if it failed, for making such an apparently
prudent investment.<br><br>As a friend of mine said, "Most VCs can't do anything that would
sound bad to the kind of doofuses who run pension funds." Angels
can take greater risks because they don't have to answer to anyone.<br><br><b>12. Being turned down by investors doesn't mean much.</b><br><br>Some founders are quite dejected when they get turned down by
investors.  They shouldn't take it so much to heart.  To start with,
investors are often wrong.  It's hard to think of a successful
startup that wasn't turned down by investors at some point.  Lots
of VCs rejected Google.  So obviously the reaction of investors is
not a very meaningful test.<br><br>Investors will often reject you for what seem to be superficial
reasons.  I read of one VC who 
<a href="http://ricksegal.typepad.com/pmv/2007/02/a_fatal_paper_c.html">turned
down</a> a startup simply because
they'd given away so many little bits of stock that the deal required
too many signatures to close. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
The reason investors can get away
with this is that they see so many deals.  It doesn't matter if
they underestimate you because of some surface imperfection, because
the next best deal will be <a href="judgement.html">almost as good</a>.  
Imagine picking out
apples at a grocery store.  You grab one with a little bruise.
Maybe it's just a surface bruise, but why even bother checking when
there are so many other unbruised apples to choose from?<br><br>Investors would be the first to admit they're often wrong.  So when
you get rejected by investors, don't think "we suck," but instead
ask "do we suck?"  Rejection is a question, not an answer.<br><br><b>13. Investors are emotional.</b><br><br>I've been surprised to discover how emotional investors can be.
You'd expect them to be cold and calculating, or at least businesslike,
but often they're not.  I'm not sure if it's their position of power
that makes them this way, or the large sums of money involved, but
investment negotiations can easily turn personal.  If you offend
investors, they'll leave in a huff.<br><br>A while ago an eminent VC firm offered a series A round to a startup
we'd seed funded.  Then they heard a rival VC firm was also interested.
They were so afraid that they'd be rejected in favor of this other
firm that they gave the startup what's known as an "exploding
termsheet."  They had, I think, 24 hours to say yes or no, or the
deal was off.  Exploding termsheets are a somewhat dubious device,
but not uncommon.  What surprised me was their reaction when I
called to talk about it.  I asked if they'd still be interested in
the startup if the rival VC didn't end up making an offer, and they
said no.  What rational basis could they have had for saying that?
If they thought the startup was worth investing in, what difference
should it make what some other VC thought?  Surely it was their
duty to their limited partners simply to invest in the best
opportunities they found; they should be delighted if the other VC
said no, because it would mean they'd overlooked a good opportunity.
But of course there was no rational basis for their decision.  They
just couldn't stand the idea of taking this rival firm's rejects.<br><br>In this case the exploding termsheet was not (or not only) a tactic
to pressure the startup.  It was more like the high school trick
of breaking up with someone before they can break up with you.  In
an <a href="startupfunding.html">earlier essay</a> I said that VCs were a lot like high school girls.
A few VCs have joked about that characterization, but none have
disputed it.<br><br><b>14. The negotiation never stops till the closing.</b><br><br>Most deals, for investment or acquisition, happen in two phases.
There's an initial phase of negotiation about the big questions.
If this succeeds you get a termsheet, so called because it outlines
the key terms of a deal.  A termsheet is not legally binding,
but it is a definite step.  It's supposed to mean that a
deal is going to happen, once the lawyers work out all the details.
In theory these details are minor ones; by definition all the
important points are supposed to be covered in the termsheet.<br><br>Inexperience and wishful thinking combine to make founders feel
that when they have a termsheet, they have a deal.  They want there
to be a deal; everyone acts like they have a deal; so there must
be a deal.  But there isn't and may not be for several months.  A
lot can change for a startup in several months.  It's not uncommon
for investors and acquirers to get buyer's remorse.  So you have
to keep pushing, keep selling, all the way to the close.  Otherwise
all the "minor" details left unspecified in the termsheet will be
interpreted to your disadvantage.  The other side may even break
the deal; if they do that, they'll usually seize on some technicality
or claim you misled them, rather than admitting they changed their
minds.<br><br>It can be hard to keep the pressure on an investor or acquirer all
the way to the closing, because the most effective pressure is
competition from other investors or acquirers, and these tend to
drop away when you get a termsheet.  You should try to stay as close
friends as you can with these rivals, but the most important thing
is just to keep up the momentum in your startup.  The investors or
acquirers chose you because you seemed hot.  Keep doing whatever
made you seem hot.  Keep releasing new features; keep getting new
users; keep getting mentioned in the press and in blogs.<br><br><b>15. Investors like to co-invest.</b><br><br>I've been surprised how willing investors are to split deals.  You
might think that if they found a good deal they'd want it all to
themselves, but they seem positively eager to syndicate.  This is
understandable with angels; they invest on a smaller scale and don't
like to have too much money tied up in any one deal.  But VCs also
share deals a lot.  Why?<br><br>Partly I think this is an artifact of the rule I quoted earlier:
after traffic, VCs care most what other VCs think.  A deal that has
multiple VCs interested in it is more likely to close, so of deals
that close, more will have multiple investors.<br><br>There is one rational reason to want multiple VCs in a deal: Any
investor who co-invests with you is one less investor who could
fund a competitor.  Apparently Kleiner and Sequoia didn't like
splitting the Google deal, but it did at least have the advantage,
from each one's point of view, that there probably wouldn't be a
competitor funded by the other.  Splitting deals thus has similar
advantages to confusing paternity.<br><br>But I think the main reason VCs like splitting deals is the fear
of looking bad.  If another firm shares the deal, then in the event
of failure it will seem to have been a prudent choice—a consensus
decision, rather than just the whim of an individual partner.<br><br><b>16. Investors collude.</b><br><br>Investing is not covered by antitrust law.  At least, it better not
be, because investors regularly do things that would be illegal
otherwise.  I know personally of cases where one investor has talked
another out of making a competitive offer, using the promise of
sharing future deals.<br><br>In principle investors are all competing for the same deals, but
the spirit of cooperation is stronger than the spirit of competition.
The reason, again, is that there are so many deals.  Though a
professional investor may have a closer relationship with a founder
he invests in than with other investors, his relationship with the
founder is only going to last a couple years, whereas his relationship
with other firms will last his whole career.  There isn't so much
at stake in his interactions with other investors, but there will
be a lot of them.  Professional investors are constantly trading
little favors.<br><br>Another reason investors stick together is to preserve the power
of investors as a whole.  So you will not, as of this writing, be
able to get investors into an auction for your series A round.
They'd rather lose the deal than establish a precedent of VCs
competitively bidding against one another.  An efficient startup
funding market may be coming in the distant future; things tend to
move in that direction; but it's certainly not here now.
<!--
The best way to describe the situation might be to say that VCs
compete intramurally. --><br><br><b>17. Large-scale investors care about their portfolio, not any
individual company.</b><br><br>The reason startups work so well is that everyone with power also
has equity.  The only way any of them can succeed is if they all
do.  This makes everyone naturally pull in the same direction,
subject to differences of opinion about tactics.<br><br>The problem is, larger scale investors don't have exactly the same
motivation.  Close, but not identical. They don't need any given
startup to succeed, like founders do, just their portfolio as a
whole to.  So in borderline cases the rational thing for them to
do is to sacrifice unpromising startups.<br><br>Large-scale investors tend to put startups in three categories:
successes, failures, and the "living dead"—companies that are
plugging along but don't seem likely in the immediate future to get
bought or go public.  To the founders, "living dead" sounds harsh.
These companies may be far from failures by ordinary standards. But
they might as well be from a venture investor's point of view, and
they suck up just as much time and attention as the successes.  So
if such a company has two possible strategies, a conservative one
that's slightly more likely to work in the end, or a risky one that
within a short time will either yield a giant success or kill the
company, VCs will push for the kill-or-cure option.  To them the
company is already a write-off.  Better to have resolution, one way
or the other, as soon as possible.<br><br>If a startup gets into real trouble, instead of trying to save it
VCs may just sell it at a low price to another of their portfolio
companies.  Philip Greenspun said in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597141"><i>Founders at Work</i></a> that Ars Digita's VCs did this to them.<br><br><b>18. Investors have different risk profiles from founders.</b><br><br>Most people would rather a 100% chance of $1 million than a 20%
chance of $10 million.  Investors are rich enough to be rational
and prefer the latter.  So they'll always tend to encourage founders
to keep rolling the dice.  If a company is doing well, investors
will want founders to turn down most acquisition offers.  And indeed,
most startups that turn down acquisition offers ultimately do better.
But it's still hair-raising for the founders, because they might
end up with nothing.  When someone's offering to buy you for a price
at which your stock is worth $5 million, saying no is equivalent
to having $5 million and betting it all on one spin of the roulette
wheel.<br><br>Investors will tell you the company is worth more.  And they may
be right.  But that doesn't mean it's wrong to sell.  Any financial
advisor who put all his client's assets in the stock of a single,
private company would probably lose his license for it.<br><br>More and more, investors are letting founders cash out partially.
That should correct the problem. Most founders have such low standards
that they'll feel rich with a sum that doesn't seem huge to investors.
But this custom is spreading too slowly, because VCs are afraid of
seeming irresponsible.  No one wants to be the first VC to give
someone fuck-you money and then actually get told "fuck you." But
until this does start to happen, we know VCs are being too conservative.<br><br><b>19. Investors vary greatly.</b><br><br>Back when I was a founder I used to think all VCs were the same.
And in fact they do all <a href="http://www.redpoint.com/team/">look</a> 
the same.  They're all what hackers
call "suits."  But since I've been dealing with VCs more I've learned
that some suits are smarter than others.<br><br>They're also in a business where winners tend to keep winning and
losers to keep losing.  When a VC firm has been successful in the
past, everyone wants funding from them, so they get the pick of all
the new deals.  The self-reinforcing nature of the venture funding
market means that the top ten firms live in a completely different
world from, say, the hundredth.  As well as being smarter, they
tend to be calmer and more upstanding; they don't need to do iffy
things to get an edge, and don't want to because they have more
brand to protect.<br><br>There are only two kinds of VCs you want to take money from, if you
have the luxury of choosing: the "top tier" VCs, meaning about the
top 20 or so firms, plus a few new ones that are not among the top
20 only because they haven't been around long enough.<br><br>It's particularly important to raise money from a top firm if you're
a hacker, because they're more confident.  That means they're less
likely to stick you with a business guy as CEO, like VCs used to
do in the 90s.  If you seem smart and want to do it, they'll let
you run the company.<br><br><b>20. Investors don't realize how much it costs to raise money from
them.</b><br><br>Raising money is a huge time suck at just the point where startups
can least afford it. It's not unusual for it to take five or six
months to close a funding round.  Six weeks is fast.  And raising
money is not just something you can leave running as a background
process.  When you're raising money, it's inevitably the main focus
of the company.  Which means building the product isn't.<br><br>Suppose a Y Combinator company starts talking to VCs after demo
day, and is successful in raising money from them, closing the deal
after a comparatively short 8 weeks.  Since demo day occurs after
10 weeks, the company is now 18 weeks old.  Raising money, rather
than working on the product, has been the company's main focus for
44% of its existence.  And mind you, this an example where things
turned out <i>well</i>.<br><br>When a startup does return to working on the product after a funding
round finally closes, it's as if they were returning to work after
a months-long illness.  They've lost most of their momentum.<br><br>Investors have no idea how much they damage the companies they
invest in by taking so long to do it.  But companies do. So there
is a big opportunity here for a new kind of venture fund that invests
smaller amounts at lower valuations, but promises to either close
or say no very quickly.  If there were such a firm, I'd recommend
it to startups in preference to any other, no matter how prestigious.
Startups live on speed and momentum.<br><br><b>21. Investors don't like to say no.</b><br><br>The reason funding deals take so long to close is mainly that
investors can't make up their minds.  VCs are not big companies;
they can do a deal in 24 hours if they need to.  But they usually
let the initial meetings stretch out over a couple weeks.  The
reason is the selection algorithm I mentioned earlier.  Most don't
try to predict whether a startup will win, but to notice quickly
that it already is winning.  They care what the market thinks of
you and what other VCs think of you, and they can't judge those
just from meeting you.<br><br>Because they're investing in things that (a) change fast and (b)
they don't understand, a lot of investors will reject you in a way
that can later be claimed not to have been a rejection.  Unless you
know this world, you may not even realize you've been rejected.
Here's a VC saying no:
<blockquote>
  We're really excited about your project, and we want to keep in
  close touch as you develop it further.
</blockquote>
Translated into more straightforward language, this means: We're
not investing in you, but we may change our minds if it looks like
you're taking off.  Sometimes they're more candid and say explicitly
that they need to "see some traction."  They'll invest in you if
you start to get lots of users.  But so would any VC.  So all they're
saying is that you're still at square 1.<br><br>Here's a test for deciding whether a VC's response was yes or no.
Look down at your hands.  Are you holding a termsheet?<br><br><b>22. You need investors.</b><br><br>Some founders say "Who needs investors?"  Empirically the answer
seems to be: everyone who wants to succeed.  Practically every
successful startup takes outside investment at some point.<br><br>Why? What the people who think they don't need investors forget is
that they will have competitors.  The question is not whether you
<i>need</i> outside investment, but whether it could help you at all.
If the answer is yes, and you don't take investment, then competitors
who do will have an advantage over you.  And in the startup world
a little advantage can expand into a lot.<br><br>Mike Moritz famously said that he invested in Yahoo because he
thought they had a few weeks' lead over their competitors.  That
may not have mattered quite so much as he thought, because Google
came along three years later and kicked Yahoo's ass.  But there is
something in what he said.  Sometimes a small lead can grow into
the yes half of a binary choice.<br><br>Maybe as it gets cheaper to start a startup, it will start to be
possible to succeed in a competitive market without outside funding.  
There are certainly
costs to raising money.  But as of this writing the empirical
evidence says it's a net win.<br><br><b>23. Investors like it when you don't need them.</b><br><br>A lot of founders approach investors as if they needed their
permission to start a company—as if it were like getting into
college.  But you don't need investors to start most companies;
they just make it easier.<br><br>And in fact, investors greatly prefer it if you don't need them.
What excites them, both consciously and unconsciously, is the sort
of startup that approaches them saying "the train's leaving the
station; are you in or out?" not the one saying "please can we have
some money to start a company?"<br><br>Most investors are "bottoms" in the sense that the startups they
like most are those that are rough with them.  When Google stuck
Kleiner and Sequoia with a $75 million premoney valuation, their
reaction was probably "Ouch! That feels so good." And they were
right, weren't they?  That deal probably made them more than any
other they've done.<br><br>The thing is, VCs are pretty good at reading people.  So don't try
to act tough with them unless you really are the next Google, or
they'll see through you in a second.  Instead of acting tough, what
most startups should do is simply always have a backup plan.  Always
have some alternative plan for getting started if any given investor
says no.  Having one is the best insurance against needing one.<br><br>So you shouldn't start a startup that's expensive to start, because
then you'll be at the mercy of investors.  If you ultimately want
to do something that will cost a lot, start by doing a cheaper
subset of it, and expand your ambitions when and if you raise more
money.<br><br>Apparently the most likely animals to be left alive after a nuclear
war are cockroaches, because they're so hard to kill.  That's what
you want to be as a startup, initially.  Instead of a beautiful
but fragile flower that needs to have its stem in a plastic tube
to support itself, better to be small, ugly, and indestructible.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I may be underestimating VCs.  They may play some behind the scenes 
role in IPOs, which you ultimately need if you want to create a silicon 
valley.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
A few VCs have an email address you can send your business
plan to, but the number of startups that get funded this way is
basically zero.  You should always get a personal introduction—and 
to a partner, not an associate.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Several people have told us that the most valuable thing about 
<a href="http://startupschool.org">startup school</a> 
was that they got to see famous startup founders and realized
they were just ordinary guys.  Though we're happy to provide this
service, this is not generally the way we pitch startup school to
potential speakers.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Actually this sounds to me like a VC who got buyer's remorse,
then used a technicality to get out of the deal.  But it's telling
that it even seemed a plausible excuse.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Hutch Fishman, and Robert

generally look back on the mid twentieth century as a golden age.
In those days we had a large number of high-paying union manufacturing
jobs that boosted the median income.  I wouldn't quite call the
high-paying union job a myth, but I think people who dwell on it
are reading too much into it.<br><br>Oddly enough, it was working with startups that made me realize
where the high-paying union job came from.  In a rapidly growing
market, you don't worry too much about efficiency.  It's more
important to grow fast.  If there's some mundane problem getting
in your way, and there's a simple solution that's somewhat expensive,
just take it and get on with more important things.  EBay didn't
win by paying less for servers than their competitors.<br><br>Difficult though it may be to imagine now, manufacturing was a
growth industry in the mid twentieth century.  This was an era when
small firms making everything from cars to candy were getting
consolidated into a new kind of corporation with national reach and
huge economies of scale.  You had to grow fast or die.  Workers
were for these companies what servers are for an Internet startup.
A reliable supply was more important than low cost.<br><br>If you looked in the head of a 1950s auto executive, the attitude
must have been: sure, give 'em whatever they ask for, so long as
the new model isn't delayed.<br><br>In other words, those workers were not paid what their work was
worth.  Circumstances being what they were, companies would have
been stupid to insist on paying them so little.<br><br>If you want a less controversial example of this phenomenon, ask
anyone who worked as a consultant building web sites during the
Internet Bubble.  In the late nineties you could get paid huge sums
of money for building the most trivial things.  And yet does anyone
who was there have any expectation those days will ever return?  I
doubt it.  Surely everyone realizes that was just a temporary
aberration.<br><br>The era of labor unions seems to have been the same kind of aberration, 
just spread
over a longer period, and mixed together with a lot of ideology
that prevents people from viewing it with as cold an eye as they
would something like consulting during the Bubble.<br><br>Basically, unions were just Razorfish.<br><br>People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic union
organizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking now?
The best they can do is fall back on the default explanation of
people living in fallen civilizations.  Our ancestors were giants.
The workers of the early twentieth century must have had a moral
courage that's lacking today.<br><br>In fact there's a simpler explanation.  The early twentieth century
was just a fast-growing startup overpaying for infrastructure.  And
we in the present are not a fallen people, who have abandoned
whatever mysterious high-minded principles produced the high-paying
union job.  We simply live in a time when the fast-growing companies
overspend on different things.<br><br><br clear="all"></div><div></div><div></div><div><br><br></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

your startup.  Should you take it?  You're about to hire your first
employee.  How much stock should you give him?<br><br>These are some of the hardest questions founders face.  And yet
both have the same answer:<br><br>1/(1 - n)<br><br>Whenever you're trading stock in your company for anything, whether
it's money or an employee or a deal with another company, the test
for whether to do it is the same.  You should give up n% of your
company if what you trade it for improves your average outcome
enough that the (100 - n)% you have left is worth more than the
whole company was before.<br><br>For example, if an investor wants to buy half your company, how
much does that investment have to improve your average outcome for
you to break even?  Obviously it has to double: if you trade half
your company for something that more than doubles the company's
average outcome, you're net ahead.  You have half as big a share
of something worth more than twice as much.<br><br>In the general case, if n is the fraction of the company you're
giving up, the deal is a good one if it makes the company worth
more than 1/(1 - n).<br><br>For example, suppose Y Combinator offers to fund you in return for
7% of your company.  In this case, n is .07 and 1/(1 - n) is 1.075.
So you should take the deal if you believe we can improve your
average outcome by more than 7.5%.  If we improve your outcome by
10%, you're net ahead, because the remaining .93 you hold is worth
.93 x 1.1 = 1.023.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>One of the things the equity equation shows us is that, financially
at least, taking money from a top VC firm can be a really good deal.
Greg Mcadoo from Sequoia recently said at a YC dinner that when
Sequoia invests alone they like to take about 30% of a company.
1/.7 = 1.43, meaning that deal is worth taking if they can improve
your outcome by more than 43%.  For the average startup, that would
be an extraordinary bargain.  It would improve the average startup's
prospects by more than 43% just to be able to <i>say</i> they were funded
by Sequoia, even if they never actually got the money.<br><br>The reason Sequoia is such a good deal is that the percentage of
the company they take is artificially low.  They don't even try to
get market price for their investment; they limit their holdings
to leave the founders enough stock to feel the company is still
theirs.<br><br>The catch is that Sequoia gets about 6000 business plans a year and
funds about 20 of them, so the odds of getting this great deal are
1 in 300. The companies that make it through are not average startups.<br><br>Of course, there are other factors to consider in a VC deal.  It's
never just a straight trade of money for stock.  But if it were,
taking money from a top firm would generally be a bargain.<br><br>You can use the same formula when giving stock to employees, but
it works in the other direction.  If i is the average outcome for
the company with the addition of some new person, then they're worth
n such that i = 1/(1 - n).  Which means n = (i - 1)/i.<br><br>For example, suppose you're just two founders and you want to hire
an additional hacker who's so good you feel he'll increase the
average outcome of the whole company by 20%.  n = (1.2 - 1)/1.2 =
.167.  So you'll break even if you trade 16.7% of the company
for him.<br><br>That doesn't mean 16.7% is the right amount of stock to give him.
Stock is not the only cost of hiring someone: there's usually salary
and overhead as well.  And if the company merely breaks even on the
deal, there's no reason to do it.<br><br>I think to translate salary and overhead into stock you should
multiply the annual rate by about 1.5.  Most startups grow fast or
die; if you die you don't have to pay the guy, and if you grow fast
you'll be paying next year's salary out of next year's valuation,
which should be 3x this year's.  If your valuation grows 3x a year,
the total cost in stock of a new hire's salary and overhead is 1.5
years' cost at the present valuation.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>How much of an additional margin should the company need as the
"activation energy" for the deal?  Since this is in effect the
company's profit on a hire, the market will determine that: if
you're a hot opportunity, you can charge more.<br><br>Let's run through an example.  Suppose the company wants to make a
"profit" of 50% on the new hire mentioned above.  So subtract a
third from 16.7% and we have 11.1% as his "retail" price.  Suppose
further that he's going to cost $60k a year in salary and overhead,
x 1.5 = $90k total.  If the company's valuation is $2 million, $90k
is 4.5%.  11.1% - 4.5% = an offer of 6.6%.<br><br>Incidentally, notice how important it is for early employees to
take little salary.  It comes right out of stock that could otherwise
be given to them.<br><br>Obviously there is a great deal of play in these numbers.  I'm not
claiming that stock grants can now be reduced to a formula.  Ultimately
you always have to guess.  But at least know what you're guessing.
If you choose a number based on your gut feel, or a table of typical
grant sizes supplied by a VC firm, understand what those are estimates
of.<br><br>And more generally, when you make any decision involving equity,
run it through 1/(1 - n) to see if it makes sense.  You should
always feel richer after trading equity.  If the trade didn't
increase the value of your remaining shares enough to put you net
ahead, you wouldn't have (or shouldn't have) done it.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] This is why we
can't believe anyone would think Y Combinator was a bad deal.  Does
anyone really think we're so useless that in three months we can't
improve a startup's prospects by 7.5%?
<!--
Usually people who say we're a bad deal, like Seth Levine in <a
href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2007-07-17-ycombinator_N.htm">this
article</a>, simply don't understand what we do.   If all we did
was write checks, YC would be a bad deal.  But in fact the money
is the least of what we do.  No VC who has seen Demo Day first hand
has ever said YC took too much equity.
--><br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>] The obvious choice
for your present valuation is the post-money valuation of your last
funding round.  This probably undervalues the company, though,
because (a) unless your last round just happened, the company is
presumably worth more, and (b) the valuation of an early funding
round usually reflects some other contribution by the investors.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit,

Most people in America do.  In fact, the
poorer people are, the more stuff they seem to have.  Hardly anyone
is so poor that they can't afford a front yard full of old cars.<br><br>It wasn't always this way.  Stuff used to be rare and valuable.
You can still see evidence of that if you look for it.  For example,
in my house in Cambridge, which was built in 1876, the bedrooms
don't have closets.  In those days people's stuff fit in a chest
of drawers.  Even as recently as a few decades ago there was a lot
less stuff.  When I look back at photos from the 1970s, I'm surprised
how empty houses look.  As a kid I had what I thought was a huge
fleet of toy cars, but they'd be dwarfed by the number of toys my
nephews have.  All together my Matchboxes and Corgis took up about
a third of the surface of my bed.  In my nephews' rooms the bed is
the only clear space.<br><br>Stuff has gotten a lot cheaper, but our attitudes toward it haven't
changed correspondingly.  We overvalue stuff.<br><br>That was a big problem
for me when I had no money.  I felt poor, and stuff seemed valuable,
so almost instinctively I accumulated it.  Friends would leave
something behind when they moved, or I'd see something as I was
walking down the street on trash night (beware of anything you find
yourself describing as "perfectly good"), or I'd find something in
almost new condition for a tenth its retail price at a garage sale.
And pow, more stuff.<br><br>In fact these free or nearly free things weren't bargains, because
they were worth even less than they cost.  Most of the stuff I
accumulated was worthless, because I didn't need it.<br><br>What I didn't understand was that the value of some new acquisition
wasn't the difference between its retail price and what I paid for
it.  It was the value I derived from it.  Stuff is an extremely
illiquid asset.  Unless you have some plan for selling that valuable
thing you got so cheaply, what difference does it make what it's
"worth?"  The only way you're ever going to extract any value from
it is to use it.  And if you don't have any immediate use for it,
you probably never will.<br><br>Companies that sell stuff have spent huge sums training us to think
stuff is still valuable.  But it would be closer to the truth to
treat stuff as worthless.<br><br>In fact, worse than worthless, because once you've accumulated a
certain amount of stuff, it starts to own you rather than the other
way around.  I know of one couple who couldn't retire to the town
they preferred because they couldn't afford a place there big enough
for all their stuff.  Their house isn't theirs; it's their stuff's.<br><br>And unless you're extremely organized, a house full of stuff can
be very depressing. A cluttered room saps one's spirits.  One
reason, obviously, is that there's less room for people in a room
full of stuff.  But there's more going on than that.  I think humans
constantly scan their environment to build a mental model of what's
around them.  And the harder a scene is to parse, the less energy
you have left for conscious thoughts.  A cluttered room is literally
exhausting.<br><br>(This could explain why clutter doesn't seem to bother kids as much
as adults. Kids are less perceptive.  They build a coarser model
of their surroundings, and this consumes less energy.)<br><br>I first realized the worthlessness of stuff when I lived in Italy
for a year.  All I took with me was one large backpack of stuff.
The rest of my stuff I left in my landlady's attic back in the US.
And you know what?  All I missed were some of the books.  By the
end of the year I couldn't even remember what else I had stored in
that attic.<br><br>And yet when I got back I didn't discard so much as a box of it.
Throw away a perfectly good rotary telephone?  I might need that
one day.<br><br>The really painful thing to recall is not just that I accumulated
all this useless stuff, but that I often spent money I desperately
needed on stuff that I didn't.<br><br>Why would I do that?  Because the people whose job is to sell you
stuff are really, really good at it.  The average 25 year old is
no match for companies that have spent years figuring out how to
get you to spend money on stuff.  They make the experience of buying
stuff so pleasant that "shopping" becomes a leisure activity.<br><br>How do you protect yourself from these people?  It can't be easy.
I'm a fairly skeptical person, and their tricks worked on me well
into my thirties.  But one thing that might work is to ask yourself,
before buying something, "is this going to make my life noticeably
better?"<br><br>A friend of mine cured herself of a clothes buying habit by asking
herself before she bought anything "Am I going to wear this all the
time?"  If she couldn't convince herself that something she was
thinking of buying would become one of those few things she wore
all the time, she wouldn't buy it.  I think that would work for any
kind of purchase.  Before you buy anything, ask yourself: will this
be something I use constantly?  Or is it just something nice?  Or
worse still, a mere bargain?<br><br>The worst stuff in this respect may be stuff you don't use much
because it's too good.  Nothing owns you like fragile stuff.  For
example, the "good china" so many households have, and whose defining
quality is not so much that it's fun to use, but that one must be
especially careful not to break it.<br><br>Another way to resist acquiring stuff is to think of the overall
cost of owning it.  The purchase price is just the beginning.  You're
going to have to <i>think</i> about that thing for years—perhaps for
the rest of your life.  Every thing you own takes energy away from
you.  Some give more than they take.  Those are the only things
worth having.<br><br>I've now stopped accumulating stuff.  Except books—but books are
different.  Books are more like a fluid than individual objects.
It's not especially inconvenient to own several thousand books,
whereas if you owned several thousand random possessions you'd be
a local celebrity.  But except for books, I now actively avoid
stuff.  If I want to spend money on some kind of treat, I'll take
<xa href="http://acadiaairtours.com/flights.html">services over 
<xa href="http://www.collectiblestoday.com/ct/product/prdid-1400328001.jsp" rel="nofollow">goods any day.<br><br>I'm not claiming this is because I've achieved some kind of zenlike
detachment from material things.  I'm talking about something more
mundane.  A historical change has taken place, and I've now realized
it.  Stuff used to be valuable, and now it's not.<br><br>In industrialized countries the same thing happened with food in
the middle of the twentieth century.  As food got cheaper (or we
got richer; they're indistinguishable), eating too much started to
be a bigger danger than eating too little.   We've now reached that
point with stuff.  For most people, rich or poor, stuff has become
a burden.<br><br>The good news is, if you're carrying a burden without knowing it,
your life could be better than you realize.  Imagine walking around
for years with five pound ankle weights, then suddenly having them
removed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

in his mind the way a mathematician holds a problem he's working
on.  Mathematicians don't answer questions by working them out on
paper the way schoolchildren are taught to.  They do more in their
heads: they try to understand a problem space well enough that they
can walk around it the way you can walk around the memory of the
house you grew up in.  At its best programming is the same.  You
hold the whole program in your head, and you can manipulate it at
will.<br><br>That's particularly valuable at the start of a project, because
initially the most important thing is to be able to change what
you're doing.  Not just to solve the problem in a different way,
but to change the problem you're solving.<br><br>Your code is your understanding of the problem you're exploring.
So it's only when you have your code in your head that you really
understand the problem.<br><br>It's not easy to get a program into your head.  If you leave a
project for a few months, it can take days to really understand it
again when you return to it.  Even when you're actively working on
a program it can take half an hour to load into your head when you
start work each day.  And that's in the best case.  Ordinary
programmers working in typical office conditions never enter this
mode.  Or to put it more dramatically, ordinary programmers working
in typical office conditions never really understand the problems
they're solving.<br><br>Even the best programmers don't always have the whole program they're
working on loaded into their heads.   But there are things you can
do to help:<br><br><ol>
<li> <b>Avoid distractions.</b>  Distractions are bad for many types of work,
   but especially bad for programming, because programmers tend to
   operate at the limit of the detail they can handle.<br><br>The danger of a distraction depends not on how long it is, but
   on how much it scrambles your brain.  A programmer can leave the
   office and go and get a sandwich without losing the code in his
   head.  But the wrong kind of interruption can wipe your brain
   in 30 seconds.<br><br>Oddly enough, scheduled distractions may be worse than unscheduled
   ones.  If you know you have a meeting in an hour, you don't even
   start working on something hard.<br><br></li><li> <b>Work in long stretches.</b>  Since there's a fixed cost each time
   you start working on a program, it's more efficient to work in
   a few long sessions than many short ones.  There will of course
   come a point where you get stupid because you're tired.  This
   varies from person to person.  I've heard of people hacking for
   36 hours straight, but the most I've ever been able to manage
   is about 18, and I work best in chunks of no more than 12.<br><br>The optimum is not the limit you can physically endure.  There's
   an advantage as well as a cost of breaking up a project.  Sometimes
   when you return to a problem after a rest, you find your unconscious
   mind has left an answer waiting for you.<br><br></li><li> <b>Use succinct languages.</b>  More 
   <a href="power.html">powerful</a> programming languages
   make programs shorter. And programmers seem to think of programs
   at least partially in the language they're using to write them.
   The more succinct the language, the shorter the program, and the
   easier it is to load and keep in your head.<br><br>You can magnify the effect of a powerful language by using a
   style called bottom-up programming, where you write programs in
   multiple layers, the lower ones acting as programming languages
   for those above.  If you do this right, you only have to keep
   the topmost layer in your head.<br><br></li><li> <b>Keep rewriting your program.</b>  Rewriting a program often yields
   a cleaner design.  But it would have advantages even if it didn't:
   you have to understand a program completely to rewrite it, so
   there is no better way to get one loaded into your head.<br><br></li><li> <b>Write rereadable code.</b>  All programmers know it's good to write
   readable code.  But you yourself are the most important reader.
   Especially in the beginning; a prototype is a conversation with
   yourself.  And when writing for yourself you have different
   priorities.  If you're writing for other people, you may not
   want to make code too dense.  Some parts of a program may be
   easiest to read if you spread things out, like an introductory 
   textbook.  Whereas if you're writing code to make it easy to reload 
   into your head, it may be best to go for brevity.<br><br></li><li> <b>Work in small groups.</b>  When you manipulate a program in your
   head, your vision tends to stop at the edge of the code you own.
   Other parts you don't understand as well, and more importantly,
   can't take liberties with.  So the smaller the number of
   programmers, the more completely a project can mutate.  If there's
   just one programmer, as there often is at first, you can do
   all-encompassing redesigns.<br><br></li><li> <b>Don't have multiple people editing the same piece of code.</b>  You
   never understand other people's code as well as your own.  No
   matter how thoroughly you've read it, you've only read it, not
   written it.  So if a piece of code is written by multiple authors,
   none of them understand it as well as a single author would.<br><br>And of course you can't safely redesign something other people
   are working on.  It's not just that you'd have to ask permission.
   You don't even let yourself think of such things.  Redesigning
   code with several authors is like changing laws; redesigning
   code you alone control is like seeing the other interpretation
   of an ambiguous image.<br><br>If you want to put several people to work on a project, divide
   it into components and give each to one person.<br><br></li><li> <b>Start small.</b>  A program gets easier to hold in your head as you
   become familiar with it.  You can start to treat parts as black
   boxes once you feel confident you've fully explored them.  But
   when you first start working on a project, you're forced to see
   everything.  If you start with too big a problem, you may never
   quite be able to encompass it.  So if you need to write a big,
   complex program, the best way to begin may not be to write a
   spec for it, but to write a prototype that solves a subset of
   the problem.  Whatever the advantages of planning, they're often
   outweighed by the advantages of being able to keep a program in
   your head.
</li></ol>
It's striking how often programmers manage to hit all eight points
by accident.  Someone has an idea for a new project, but because
it's not officially sanctioned, he has to do it in off hours—which
turn out to be more productive because there are no distractions.
Driven by his enthusiasm for the new project he works on it for
many hours at a stretch.  Because it's initially just an
experiment, instead of a "production" language he uses a mere
"scripting" language—which is in fact far more powerful.  He
completely rewrites the program several times; that wouldn't be
justifiable for an official project, but this is a labor of love
and he wants it to be perfect.  And since no one is going to see
it except him, he omits any comments except the note-to-self variety.
He works in a small group perforce, because he either hasn't told
anyone else about the idea yet, or it seems so unpromising that no
one else is allowed to work on it.  Even if there is a group, they
couldn't have multiple people editing the same code, because it
changes too fast for that to be possible.  And the project starts
small because the idea <i>is</i> small at first; he just has some cool
hack he wants to try out.<br><br>Even more striking are the number of officially sanctioned projects
that manage to do <i>all eight things wrong</i>.  In fact, if you look at
the way software gets written in most organizations, it's almost
as if they were deliberately trying to do things wrong. In a sense,
they are.  One of the defining qualities of organizations since
there have been such a thing is to treat individuals as interchangeable
parts.  This works well for more parallelizable tasks, like fighting
wars.  For most of history a well-drilled army of professional
soldiers could be counted on to beat an army of individual warriors,
no matter how valorous.  But having ideas is not very parallelizable.
And that's what programs are: ideas.<br><br>It's not merely true that organizations dislike the idea of depending
on individual genius, it's a tautology.  It's part of the definition
of an organization not to.  Of our current concept of an organization,
at least.<br><br>Maybe we could define a new kind of organization that combined the
efforts of individuals without requiring them to be interchangeable.
Arguably a market is such a form of organization, though it may be
more accurate to describe a market as a degenerate case—as what
you get by default when organization isn't possible.<br><br>Probably the best we'll do is some kind of hack, like making the
programming parts of an organization work differently from the rest.
Perhaps the optimal solution is for big companies not even to try
to develop ideas in house, but simply to 
<a href="hiring.html">buy</a> them.  But regardless
of what the solution turns out to be, the first step is to realize
there's a problem.  There is a contradiction in the very phrase
"software company."   The two words are pulling in opposite directions.
Any good programmer in a large organization is going to be at odds
with it, because organizations are designed to prevent what
programmers strive for.<br><br><xa href="gh.html">Good programmers manage to get a lot done anyway.  
But often it
requires practically an act of rebellion against the organizations
that employ them.  Perhaps it will help if more people understand that the way
programmers behave is driven by the demands of the work they do.
It's not because they're irresponsible that they work in long binges
during which they blow off all other obligations, plunge straight into
programming instead of writing specs first, and rewrite code that
already works.  It's not because they're unfriendly that they prefer
to work alone, or growl at people who pop their head in the door
to say hello.  This apparently random collection of annoying habits
has a single explanation: the power of holding a program in one's
head.<br><br>Whether or not understanding this can help large organizations, it
can certainly help their competitors.  The weakest point in big
companies is that they don't let individual programmers do great
work.  So if you're a little startup, this is the place to attack
them.  Take on the kind of problems that have to be solved in one
big brain.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>
August 2007<br><br><i>(This is a talk I gave at the last 
Y Combinator dinner of the summer. 
Usually we don't have a speaker at the last dinner; it's more of
a party.  But it seemed worth spoiling the atmosphere if I could
save some of the startups from
preventable deaths.  So at the last minute I cooked up this rather
grim talk.  I didn't mean this as an essay; I wrote it down
because I only had two hours before dinner and think fastest while
writing.)
</i><br><br>A couple days ago I told a reporter that we expected about a third
of the companies we funded to succeed.  Actually I was being
conservative.  I'm hoping it might be as much as a half.  Wouldn't
it be amazing if we could achieve a 50% success rate?<br><br>Another way of saying that is that half of you are going to die.  Phrased
that way, it doesn't sound good at all.  In fact, it's kind of weird
when you think about it, because our definition of success is that
the founders get rich.  If half the startups we fund succeed, then
half of you are going to get rich and the other half are going to
get nothing.<br><br>If you can just avoid dying, you get rich.  That sounds like a joke,
but it's actually a pretty good description of what happens in a
typical startup.  It certainly describes what happened in Viaweb.
We avoided dying till we got rich.<br><br>It was really close, too.  When we were visiting Yahoo to talk about
being acquired, we had to interrupt everything and borrow one of
their conference rooms to talk down an investor who was about to
back out of a new funding round we needed to stay alive.   So even
in the middle of getting rich we were fighting off the grim reaper.<br><br>You may have heard that quote about luck consisting of opportunity
meeting preparation.  You've now done the preparation.  The work
you've done so far has, in effect, put you in a position to get
lucky: you can now get rich by not letting your company die.  That's
more than most people have.  So let's talk about how not to die.<br><br>We've done this five times now, and we've seen a bunch of startups
die.  About 10 of them so far.  We don't know exactly what happens
when they die, because they generally don't die loudly and heroically.
Mostly they crawl off somewhere and die.<br><br>For us the main indication of impending doom is when we don't hear
from you.  When we haven't heard from, or about, a startup for a
couple months, that's a bad sign.  If we send them an email asking
what's up, and they don't reply, that's a really bad sign.  So far
that is a 100% accurate predictor of death.<br><br>Whereas if a startup regularly does new deals and releases and
either sends us mail or shows up at YC events, they're probably
going to live.<br><br>I realize this will sound naive, but maybe the linkage works in
both directions.  Maybe if you can arrange that we keep hearing
from you, you won't die.<br><br>That may not be so naive as it sounds.  You've probably noticed
that having dinners every Tuesday with us and the other founders
causes you to get more done than you would otherwise, because every
dinner is a mini Demo Day.  Every dinner is a kind of a deadline.
So the mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us will
push you to make things happen, because otherwise you'll be embarrassed
to tell us that you haven't done anything new since the last time
we talked.<br><br>If this works, it would be an amazing hack.  It would be pretty
cool if merely by staying in regular contact with us you could get
rich.  It sounds crazy, but there's a good chance that would work.<br><br>A variant is to stay in touch with other YC-funded startups.  There
is now a whole neighborhood of them in San Francisco.  If you move
there, the peer pressure that made you work harder all summer will
continue to operate.<br><br>When startups die, the official cause of death is always either
running out of money or a critical founder bailing.  Often the two
occur simultaneously.  But I think the underlying cause is usually
that they've become demoralized.  You rarely hear of a startup
that's working around the clock doing deals and pumping out new
features, and dies because they can't pay their bills and their ISP
unplugs their server.<br><br>Startups rarely die in mid keystroke.  So keep typing!<br><br>If so many startups get demoralized and fail when merely by hanging
on they could get rich, you have to assume that running a startup
can be demoralizing.  That is certainly true.  I've been there, and
that's why I've never done another startup.  The low points in a
startup are just unbelievably low.  I bet even Google had moments
where things seemed hopeless.<br><br>Knowing that should help.  If you know it's going to feel terrible
sometimes, then when it feels terrible you won't think "ouch, this
feels terrible, I give up."  It feels that way for everyone.  And
if you just hang on, things will probably get better.  The metaphor
people use to describe the way a startup feels is at least a roller
coaster and not drowning.  You don't just sink and sink; there are
ups after the downs.<br><br>Another feeling that seems alarming but is in fact normal in a
startup is the feeling that what you're doing isn't working.  The
reason you can expect to feel this is that what you do probably
won't work.  Startups almost never get it right the first time.
Much more commonly you launch something, and no one cares.  Don't
assume when this happens that you've failed.  That's normal for
startups.  But don't sit around doing nothing.  Iterate.<br><br>I like Paul Buchheit's suggestion of trying to make something that
at least someone really loves.  As long as you've made something
that a few users are ecstatic about, you're on the right track.  It
will be good for your morale to have even a handful of users who
really love you, and startups run on morale.  But also it
will tell you what to focus on.  What is it about you that they
love?  Can you do more of that?  Where can you find more people who
love that sort of thing?  As long as you have some core of users
who love you, all you have to do is expand it.  It may take a while,
but as long as you keep plugging away, you'll win in the end.  Both
Blogger and Delicious did that.  Both took years to succeed.  But
both began with a core of fanatically devoted users, and all Evan
and Joshua had to do was grow that core incrementally.  
<a href="http://wufoo.com">Wufoo</a> is
on the same trajectory now.<br><br>So when you release something and it seems like no one cares, look
more closely.  Are there zero users who really love you, or is there
at least some little group that does?  It's quite possible there
will be zero.  In that case, tweak your product and try again.
Every one of you is working on a space that contains at least one
winning permutation somewhere in it.  If you just keep trying,
you'll find it.<br><br>Let me mention some things not to do.  The number one thing not to
do is other things.  If you find yourself saying a sentence that
ends with "but we're going to keep working on the startup," you are
in big trouble.  Bob's going to grad school, but we're going to
keep working on the startup.  We're moving back to Minnesota, but
we're going to keep working on the startup.  We're taking on some
consulting projects, but we're going to keep working on the startup.
You may as well just translate these to "we're giving up on the
startup, but we're not willing to admit that to ourselves," because
that's what it means most of the time.  A startup is so hard that
working on it can't be preceded by "but."<br><br>In particular, don't go to graduate school, and don't start other
projects.  Distraction is fatal to startups.  Going to (or back to)
school is a huge predictor of death because in addition to the
distraction it gives you something to say you're doing.  If you're
only doing a startup, then if the startup fails, you fail.  If
you're in grad school and your startup fails, you can say later "Oh
yeah, we had this startup on the side when I was in grad school,
but it didn't go anywhere."<br><br>You can't use euphemisms like "didn't go anywhere" for something
that's your only occupation.  People won't let you.<br><br>One of the most interesting things we've discovered from working
on Y Combinator is that founders are more motivated by the fear of
looking bad than by the hope of getting millions of dollars.   So
if you want to get millions of dollars, put yourself in a position
where failure will be public and humiliating.<br><br>When we first met the founders of 
<a href="http://octopart.com">Octopart</a>, they seemed very smart,
but not a great bet to succeed, because they didn't seem especially
committed.  One of the two founders was still in grad school.  It
was the usual story: he'd drop out if it looked like the startup
was taking off.  Since then he has not only dropped out of grad
school, but appeared full length in 
<a href="http://docs.octopart.com/newsweek_octopart_small.jpg">Newsweek</a> 
with the word "Billionaire"
printed across his chest.  He just cannot fail now.  Everyone he
knows has seen that picture.  Girls who dissed him in high school
have seen it.  His mom probably has it on the fridge.  It would be
unthinkably humiliating to fail now.  At this point he is committed
to fight to the death.<br><br>I wish every startup we funded could appear in a Newsweek article
describing them as the next generation of billionaires, because
then none of them would be able to give up.  The success rate would
be 90%.  I'm not kidding.<br><br>When we first knew the Octoparts they were lighthearted, cheery
guys.  Now when we talk to them they seem grimly determined.  The
electronic parts distributors are trying to squash them to keep
their monopoly pricing.  (If it strikes you as odd that people still
order electronic parts out of thick paper catalogs in 2007, there's
a reason for that.  The distributors want to prevent the transparency
that comes from having prices online.)  I feel kind of bad that
we've transformed these guys from lighthearted to grimly determined.
But that comes with the territory.  If a startup succeeds, you get
millions of dollars, and you don't get that kind of money just by
asking for it.  You have to assume it takes some amount of pain.<br><br>And however tough things get for the Octoparts, I predict they'll
succeed.  They may have to morph themselves into something totally
different, but they won't just crawl off and die.  They're smart;
they're working in a promising field; and they just cannot give up.<br><br>All of you guys already have the first two.  You're all smart and
working on promising ideas.  Whether you end up among the living
or the dead comes down to the third ingredient, not giving up.<br><br>So I'll tell you now: bad shit is coming.  It always is in a startup.
The odds of getting from launch to liquidity without some kind of
disaster happening are one in a thousand.  So don't get demoralized.
When the disaster strikes, just say to yourself, ok, this was what
Paul was talking about.  What did he say to do?  Oh, yeah.  Don't
give up.<br><br></p></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><a href="http://www.aoky.net/articles/paul_graham/die.htm">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><a href="http://academy.hsoub.com/entrepreneurship/general/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%91%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%91%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%A6%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%9Fhow-not-to-die-r62/">Arabic Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><br><br></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

me. It may not matter all that much where you go to college.<br><br>For me, as for a lot of middle class kids, getting into a good
college was more or less the meaning of life when I was growing up.
What was I?  A student.  To do that well meant to get good grades.
Why did one have to get good grades?  To get into a good college.
And why did one want to do that?  There seemed to be several reasons:
you'd learn more, get better jobs, make more money.  But it didn't
matter exactly what the benefits would be.  College was a bottleneck
through which all your future prospects passed; everything would
be better if you went to a better college.<br><br>A few weeks ago I realized that somewhere along the line I had
stopped believing that.<br><br>What first set me thinking about this was the new trend of worrying
obsessively about what 
<a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/urban/education/features/15141/">kindergarten</a>
your kids go to.  It seemed to
me this couldn't possibly matter.  Either it won't help your kid
get into Harvard, or if it does, getting into Harvard won't mean
much anymore.  And then I thought: how much does it mean even now?<br><br>It turns out I have a lot of data about that.  My three partners
and I run a seed stage investment firm called 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>.  We
invest when the company is just a couple guys and an idea.  The
idea doesn't matter much; it will change anyway.  Most of our
decision is based on the founders.  The average founder is three
years out of college.  Many have just graduated; a few are still
in school.  So we're in much the same position as a graduate program,
or a company hiring people right out of college.  Except our choices
are immediately and visibly tested.  There are two possible outcomes
for a startup: success or failure—and usually you know within a
year which it will be.<br><br>The test applied to a startup is among the purest of real world
tests.  A startup succeeds or fails depending almost entirely on
the efforts of the founders.  Success is decided by the market: you
only succeed if users like what you've built.  And users don't care
where you went to college.<br><br>As well as having precisely measurable results, we have a lot of
them.  Instead of doing a small number of large deals like a
traditional venture capital fund, we do a large number of small
ones.  We currently fund about 40 companies a year, selected from
about 900 applications representing a total of about 2000 people. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Between the volume of people we judge and the rapid, unequivocal
test that's applied to our choices, Y Combinator has been an
unprecedented opportunity for learning how to pick winners.  One
of the most surprising things we've learned is how little it matters
where people went to college.<br><br>I thought I'd already been cured of caring about that.  There's
nothing like going to grad school at Harvard to cure you of any
illusions you might have about the average Harvard undergrad.  And
yet Y Combinator showed us we were still overestimating people who'd
been to elite colleges.  We'd interview people from MIT or Harvard
or Stanford and sometimes find ourselves thinking: they <i>must</i> be
smarter than they seem.  It took us a few iterations to learn to
trust our senses.<br><br>Practically everyone thinks that someone who went to MIT or Harvard
or Stanford must be smart.  Even people who hate you for it believe
it.<br><br>But when you think about what it means to have gone to an elite
college, how could this be true?   We're talking about a decision
made by admissions officers—basically, HR people—based on a
cursory examination of a huge pile of depressingly similar applications
submitted by seventeen year olds.  And what do they have to go on?
An easily gamed standardized test; a short essay telling you what
the kid thinks you want to hear; an interview with a random alum;
a high school record that's largely an index of obedience.  Who
would rely on such a test?<br><br>And yet a lot of companies do.  A lot of companies are very much
influenced by where applicants went to college.  How could they be?
I think I know the answer to that.<br><br>There used to be a saying in the corporate world: "No one ever got
fired for buying IBM."  You no longer hear this about IBM specifically,
but the idea is very much alive; there is a whole category of
"enterprise" software companies that exist to take advantage of it.
People buying technology for large organizations don't care if they
pay a fortune for mediocre software.  It's not their money.  They
just want to buy from a supplier who seems safe—a company with
an established name, confident salesmen, impressive offices, and
software that conforms to all the current fashions.  Not necessarily
a company that will deliver so much as one that, if they do let you
down, will still seem to have been a prudent choice.  So companies
have evolved to fill that niche.<br><br>A recruiter at a big company is in much the same position as someone
buying technology for one.  If someone went to Stanford and is not
obviously insane, they're probably a safe bet.  And a safe bet is
enough.  No one ever measures recruiters by the later performance
of people they turn down. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>I'm not saying, of course, that elite colleges have evolved to prey
upon the weaknesses of large organizations the way enterprise
software companies have.  But they work as if they had.  In addition
to the power of the brand name, graduates of elite colleges have
two critical qualities that plug right into the way large organizations
work.  They're good at doing what they're asked, since that's what
it takes to please the adults who judge you at seventeen.  And
having been to an elite college makes them more confident.<br><br>Back in the days when people might spend their whole career at one
big company, these qualities must have been very valuable.  Graduates
of elite colleges would have been capable, yet amenable to authority.
And since individual performance is so hard to measure in large
organizations, their own confidence would have been the starting
point for their reputation.<br><br>Things are very different in the new world of startups.  We couldn't
save someone from the market's judgement even if we wanted to.  And
being charming and confident counts for nothing with users.  All
users care about is whether you make something they like.  If you
don't, you're dead.<br><br>Knowing that test is coming makes us work a lot harder to get the
right answers than anyone would if they were merely hiring people.
We can't afford to have any illusions about the predictors of
success.  And what we've found is that the variation between schools
is so much smaller than the variation between individuals that it's
negligible by comparison.  We can learn more about someone in the
first minute of talking to them than by knowing where they went to
school.<br><br>It seems obvious when you put it that way.  Look at the individual,
not where they went to college.  But that's a weaker statement than
the idea I began with, that it doesn't matter much where a given
individual goes to college.  Don't you learn things at the best
schools that you wouldn't learn at lesser places?<br><br>Apparently not.  Obviously you can't prove this in the case of a
single individual, but you can tell from aggregate evidence: you
can't, without asking them, distinguish people who went to one
school from those who went to another three times as far down the
<i>US News</i> list. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
Try it and see.<br><br>How can this be?  Because how much you learn in college depends a
lot more on you than the college.  A determined party animal can
get through the best school without learning anything.  And someone
with a real thirst for knowledge will be able to find a few smart
people to learn from at a school that isn't prestigious at all.<br><br>
The other students are the biggest advantage of going to an elite
college; you learn more from them than the professors.  But
you should be able to reproduce this at most colleges if you make
a conscious effort to find smart friends.  At
most colleges you can find at least a handful of other smart students,
and most people have only a handful of close friends in college
anyway. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
The odds of finding smart professors are even better.
The curve for faculty is a lot flatter than for students, especially
in math and the hard sciences; you have to go pretty far down the
list of colleges before you stop finding smart professors in the
math department.<br><br>So it's not surprising that we've found the relative prestige of
different colleges useless in judging individuals.  There's a lot
of randomness in how colleges select people, and what they learn
there depends much more on them than the college.  Between these
two sources of variation, the college someone went to doesn't mean
a lot.  It is to some degree a predictor of ability, but so weak
that we regard it mainly as a source of error and try consciously
to ignore it.<br><br>I doubt what we've discovered is an anomaly specific to startups.
Probably people have always overestimated the importance of where
one goes to college.  We're just finally able to measure it.<br><br>The unfortunate thing is not just that people are judged by such a
superficial test, but that so many judge themselves by it.  A lot
of people, probably the majority of people in America, have
some amount of insecurity about where, or whether, they went to
college.  The tragedy of the situation is that by far the greatest
liability of not having gone to the college you'd have liked is
your own feeling that you're thereby lacking something.  Colleges
are a bit like exclusive clubs in this respect.  There is only one
real advantage to being a member of most exclusive clubs: you know
you wouldn't be missing much if you weren't.  When you're excluded,
you can only imagine the advantages of being an insider.  But
invariably they're larger in your imagination than in real life.<br><br>So it is with colleges.  Colleges differ, but they're nothing like
the stamp of destiny so many imagine them to be.  People aren't
what some admissions officer decides about them at seventeen.
They're what they make themselves.<br><br>Indeed, the great advantage of not caring where people went to
college is not just that you can stop judging them (and yourself)
by superficial measures, but that you can focus instead on what
really matters.  What matters is what you make of yourself.  
I think that's what we
should tell kids.  Their job isn't to get good grades so they can
get into a good college, but to learn and do.  And not just because
that's more rewarding than worldly success.  That will increasingly
<i>be</i> the route to worldly success.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] 
Is what we measure worth measuring?  I think so.  You can get
rich simply by being energetic and unscrupulous, but getting rich
from a technology startup takes some amount of brains.   It is just
the kind of work the upper middle class values; it has about the
same intellectual component as being a doctor.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>] 
Actually, someone did, once.  Mitch Kapor's wife Freada was
in charge of HR at Lotus in the early years.  (As he is at pains
to point out, they did not become romantically involved till
afterward.)  At one point they worried Lotus was losing its startup
edge and turning into a big company.  So as an experiment she sent
their recruiters the resumes of the first 40 employees, with
identifying details changed.  These were the people who had made
Lotus into the star it was.  Not one got an interview.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>] 
The <i>US News</i> list?  Surely no one trusts that.  Even if the
statistics they consider are useful, how do they decide on the
relative weights?  The reason the <i>US News</i> list is meaningful is
precisely because they are so intellectually dishonest in that
respect.  There is no external source they can use to calibrate the
weighting of the statistics they use; if there were, we could just
use that instead.  What they must do is adjust the weights till the
top schools are the usual suspects in about the right order.  So
in effect what the <i>US News</i> list tells us is what the editors think
the top schools are, which is probably not far from the conventional
wisdom on the matter.  The amusing thing is, because some schools
work hard to game the system, the editors will have to keep tweaking
their algorithm to get the rankings they want.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]

I had several motives, some more honorable than others.  One of the
less honorable was to shock people.  College was regarded as job
training where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively
impractical thing to do.  Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes
or putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other forms
of impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.<br><br>But I had some more honest motives as well.  I thought studying
philosophy would be a shortcut straight to wisdom.  All the people
majoring in other things would just end up with a bunch of domain
knowledge.  I would be learning what was really what.<br><br>I'd tried to read a few philosophy books.  Not recent ones; you
wouldn't find those in our high school library.  But I tried to
read Plato and Aristotle.  I doubt I believed I understood them,
but they sounded like they were talking about something important.
I assumed I'd learn what in college.<br><br>The summer before senior year I took some college classes.  I learned
a lot in the calculus class, but I didn't learn much in Philosophy
101.  And yet my plan to study philosophy remained intact.  It was
my fault I hadn't learned anything.  I hadn't read the books we
were assigned carefully enough.  I'd give Berkeley's <i>Principles
of Human Knowledge</i> another shot in college.  Anything so admired
and so difficult to read must have something in it, if one could
only figure out what.<br><br>Twenty-six years later, I still don't understand Berkeley.  I have
a nice edition of his collected works.  Will I ever read it?  Seems
unlikely.<br><br>The difference between then and now is that now I understand why
Berkeley is probably not worth trying to understand.  I think I see
now what went wrong with philosophy, and how we might fix it.<br><br><b>Words</b><br><br>I did end up being a philosophy major for most of college.  It
didn't work out as I'd hoped.  I didn't learn any magical truths
compared to which everything else was mere domain knowledge.  But
I do at least know now why I didn't.  Philosophy doesn't really
have a subject matter in the way math or history or most other
university subjects do.  There is no core of knowledge one must
master.  The closest you come to that is a knowledge of what various
individual philosophers have said about different topics over the
years.  Few were sufficiently correct that people have forgotten
who discovered what they discovered.<br><br>Formal logic has some subject matter. I took several classes in
logic.  I don't know if I learned anything from them.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
It does seem to me very important to be able to flip ideas around in
one's head: to see when two ideas don't fully cover the space of
possibilities, or when one idea is the same as another but with a
couple things changed.  But did studying logic teach me the importance
of thinking this way, or make me any better at it?  I don't know.<br><br>There are things I know I learned from studying philosophy.  The
most dramatic I learned immediately, in the first semester of
freshman year, in a class taught by Sydney Shoemaker.  I learned
that I don't exist.  I am (and you are) a collection of cells that
lurches around driven by various forces, and calls itself <i>I</i>.  But
there's no central, indivisible thing that your identity goes with.
You could conceivably lose half your brain and live.  Which means
your brain could conceivably be split into two halves and each
transplanted into different bodies.  Imagine waking up after such
an operation.  You have to imagine being two people.<br><br>The real lesson here is that the concepts we use in everyday life
are fuzzy, and break down if pushed too hard.  Even a concept as
dear to us as <i>I</i>.  It took me a while to grasp this, but when I
did it was fairly sudden, like someone in the nineteenth century
grasping evolution and realizing the story of creation they'd been
told as a child was all wrong. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Outside of math there's a limit
to how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad
definition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise
meanings.  Everyday words are inherently imprecise.  They work well
enough in everyday life that you don't notice.  Words seem to work,
just as Newtonian physics seems to.  But you can always make them
break if you push them far enough.<br><br>I would say that this has been, unfortunately for philosophy, the
central fact of philosophy.  Most philosophical debates are not
merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words.  Do we
have free will?  Depends what you mean by "free." Do abstract ideas
exist?  Depends what you mean by "exist."<br><br>Wittgenstein is popularly credited with the idea that most philosophical
controversies are due to confusions over language.  I'm not sure
how much credit to give him.  I suspect a lot of people realized
this, but reacted simply by not studying philosophy, rather than
becoming philosophy professors.<br><br>How did things get this way?  Can something people have spent
thousands of years studying really be a waste of time?  Those are
interesting questions.  In fact, some of the most interesting
questions you can ask about philosophy.  The most valuable way to
approach the current philosophical tradition may be neither to get
lost in pointless speculations like Berkeley, nor to shut them down
like Wittgenstein, but to study it as an example of reason gone
wrong.<br><br><b>History</b><br><br>Western philosophy really begins with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.
What we know of their predecessors comes from fragments and references
in later works; their doctrines could be described as speculative
cosmology that occasionally strays into analysis.  Presumably they
were driven by whatever makes people in every other society invent
cosmologies.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>With Socrates, Plato, and particularly Aristotle, this tradition
turned a corner.  There started to be a lot more analysis.  I suspect
Plato and Aristotle were encouraged in this by progress in math.
Mathematicians had by then shown that you could figure things out
in a much more conclusive way than by making up fine sounding stories
about them.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>People talk so much about abstractions now that we don't realize
what a leap it must have been when they first started to.  It was
presumably many thousands of years between when people first started
describing things as hot or cold and when someone asked "what is
heat?"  No doubt it was a very gradual process.  We don't know if
Plato or Aristotle were the first to ask any of the questions they
did.  But their works are the oldest we have that do this on a large
scale, and there is a freshness (not to say naivete) about them
that suggests some of the questions they asked were new to them,
at least.<br><br>Aristotle in particular reminds me of the phenomenon that happens
when people discover something new, and are so excited by it that
they race through a huge percentage of the newly discovered territory
in one lifetime.  If so, that's evidence of how new this kind of
thinking was. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>This is all to explain how Plato and Aristotle can be very impressive
and yet naive and mistaken.  It was impressive even to ask the
questions they did.  That doesn't mean they always came up with
good answers.  It's not considered insulting to say that ancient
Greek mathematicians were naive in some respects, or at least lacked
some concepts that would have made their lives easier.  So I hope
people will not be too offended if I propose that ancient philosophers
were similarly naive.  In particular, they don't seem to have fully
grasped what I earlier called the central fact of philosophy: that
words break if you push them too far.<br><br>"Much to the surprise of the builders of the first digital computers,"
Rod Brooks wrote, "programs written for them usually did not work."
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font>
Something similar happened when people first started trying
to talk about abstractions.  Much to their surprise, they didn't
arrive at answers they agreed upon.  In fact, they rarely seemed
to arrive at answers at all.<br><br>They were in effect arguing about artifacts induced by sampling at
too low a resolution.<br><br>The proof of how useless some of their answers turned out to be is
how little effect they have.  No one after reading Aristotle's
<i>Metaphysics</i> does anything differently as a result.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Surely I'm not claiming that ideas have to have practical applications
to be interesting?  No, they may not have to.  Hardy's boast that
number theory had no use whatsoever wouldn't disqualify it.  But
he turned out to be mistaken.  In fact, it's suspiciously hard to
find a field of math that truly has no practical use.  And Aristotle's
explanation of the ultimate goal of philosophy in Book A of the
<i>Metaphysics</i> implies that philosophy should be useful too.<br><br><b>Theoretical Knowledge</b><br><br>Aristotle's goal was to find the most general of general principles.
The examples he gives are convincing: an ordinary worker builds
things a certain way out of habit; a master craftsman can do more
because he grasps the underlying principles.  The trend is clear:
the more general the knowledge, the more admirable it is.  But then
he makes a mistake—possibly the most important mistake in the
history of philosophy.  He has noticed that theoretical knowledge
is often acquired for its own sake, out of curiosity, rather than
for any practical need.  So he proposes there are two kinds of
theoretical knowledge: some that's useful in practical matters and
some that isn't.  Since people interested in the latter are interested
in it for its own sake, it must be more noble.  So he sets as his
goal in the <i>Metaphysics</i> the exploration of knowledge that has no
practical use.  Which means no alarms go off when he takes on grand
but vaguely understood questions and ends up getting lost in a sea
of words.<br><br>His mistake was to confuse motive and result.  Certainly, people
who want a deep understanding of something are often driven by
curiosity rather than any practical need.  But that doesn't mean
what they end up learning is useless.  It's very valuable in practice
to have a deep understanding of what you're doing; even if you're
never called on to solve advanced problems, you can see shortcuts
in the solution of simple ones, and your knowledge won't break down
in edge cases, as it would if you were relying on formulas you
didn't understand.  Knowledge is power.  That's what makes theoretical
knowledge prestigious.  It's also what causes smart people to be
curious about certain things and not others; our DNA is not so
disinterested as we might think.<br><br>So while ideas don't have to have immediate practical applications
to be interesting, the kinds of things we find interesting will
surprisingly often turn out to have practical applications.<br><br>The reason Aristotle didn't get anywhere in the <i>Metaphysics</i> was
partly that he set off with contradictory aims: to explore the most
abstract ideas, guided by the assumption that they were useless.
He was like an explorer looking for a territory to the north of
him, starting with the assumption that it was located to the south.<br><br>And since his work became the map used by generations of future
explorers, he sent them off in the wrong direction as well. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font>
Perhaps worst of all, he protected them from both the criticism of
outsiders and the promptings of their own inner compass by establishing
the principle that the most noble sort of theoretical knowledge had
to be useless.<br><br>The <i>Metaphysics</i> is mostly a failed experiment.  A few ideas from
it turned out to be worth keeping; the bulk of it has had no effect
at all.  The <i>Metaphysics</i> is among the least read of all famous
books.  It's not hard to understand the way Newton's <i>Principia</i>
is, but the way a garbled message is.<br><br>Arguably it's an interesting failed experiment.  But unfortunately
that was not the conclusion Aristotle's successors derived from
works like the <i>Metaphysics</i>. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font>
Soon after, the western world
fell on intellectual hard times.  Instead of version 1s to be
superseded, the works of Plato and Aristotle became revered texts
to be mastered and discussed.  And so things remained for a shockingly
long time.  It was not till around 1600 (in Europe, where the center
of gravity had shifted by then) that one found people confident
enough to treat Aristotle's work as a catalog of mistakes.  And
even then they rarely said so outright.<br><br>If it seems surprising that the gap was so long, consider how little
progress there was in math between Hellenistic times and the
Renaissance.<br><br>In the intervening years an unfortunate idea took hold:  that it
was not only acceptable to produce works like the <i>Metaphysics</i>,
but that it was a particularly prestigious line of work, done by a
class of people called philosophers.  No one thought to go back and
debug Aristotle's motivating argument.  And so instead of correcting
the problem Aristotle discovered by falling into it—that you can
easily get lost if you talk too loosely about very abstract ideas—they 
continued to fall into it.<br><br><b>The Singularity</b><br><br>Curiously, however, the works they produced continued to attract
new readers.  Traditional philosophy occupies a kind of singularity
in this respect.  If you write in an unclear way about big ideas,
you produce something that seems tantalizingly attractive to
inexperienced but intellectually ambitious students.  Till one knows
better, it's hard to distinguish something that's hard to understand
because the writer was unclear in his own mind from something like
a mathematical proof that's hard to understand because the ideas
it represents are hard to understand.  To someone who hasn't learned
the difference, traditional philosophy seems extremely attractive:
as hard (and therefore impressive) as math, yet broader in scope.
That was what lured me in as a high school student.<br><br>This singularity is even more singular in having its own defense
built in.  When things are hard to understand, people who suspect
they're nonsense generally keep quiet.  There's no way to prove a
text is meaningless.  The closest you can get is to show that the
official judges of some class of texts can't distinguish them from
placebos. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>And so instead of denouncing philosophy, most people who suspected
it was a waste of time just studied other things.  That alone is
fairly damning evidence, considering philosophy's claims.  It's
supposed to be about the ultimate truths. Surely all smart people
would be interested in it, if it delivered on that promise.<br><br>Because philosophy's flaws turned away the sort of people who might
have corrected them, they tended to be self-perpetuating.  Bertrand
Russell wrote in a letter in 1912:
<blockquote>
  Hitherto the people attracted to philosophy have been mostly those
  who loved the big generalizations, which were all wrong, so that
  few people with exact minds have taken up the subject.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
His response was to launch Wittgenstein at it, with dramatic results.<br><br>I think Wittgenstein deserves to be famous not for the discovery
that most previous philosophy was a waste of time, which judging
from the circumstantial evidence must have been made by every smart
person who studied a little philosophy and declined to pursue it
further, but for how he acted in response.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font>
Instead of quietly
switching to another field, he made a fuss, from inside.  He was
Gorbachev.<br><br>The field of philosophy is still shaken from the fright Wittgenstein
gave it. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font>
Later in life he spent a lot of time talking about
how words worked.  Since that seems to be allowed, that's what a
lot of philosophers do now.  Meanwhile, sensing a vacuum in the
metaphysical speculation department, the people who used to do
literary criticism have been edging Kantward, under new names like
"literary theory," "critical theory," and when they're feeling
ambitious, plain "theory."  The writing is the familiar word salad:
<blockquote>
  Gender is not like some of the other grammatical modes which
  express precisely a mode of conception without any reality that
  corresponds to the conceptual mode, and consequently do not express
  precisely something in reality by which the intellect could be
  moved to conceive a thing the way it does, even where that motive
  is not something in the thing as such.
  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#999999">14</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
The singularity I've described is not going away.  There's a market
for writing that sounds impressive and can't be disproven. There
will always be both supply and demand.  So if one group abandons
this territory, there will always be others ready to occupy it.<br><br><b>A Proposal</b><br><br>We may be able to do better.  Here's an intriguing possibility.
Perhaps we should do what Aristotle meant to do, instead of what
he did.  The goal he announces in the <i>Metaphysics</i> seems one worth
pursuing: to discover the most general truths.  That sounds good.
But instead of trying to discover them because they're useless,
let's try to discover them because they're useful.<br><br>I propose we try again, but that we use that heretofore despised
criterion, applicability, as a guide to keep us from wondering
off into a swamp of abstractions.  Instead of trying to answer the
question:
<blockquote>
  What are the most general truths?
</blockquote>
let's try to answer the question
<blockquote>
  Of all the useful things we can say, which are the most general?
</blockquote>
The test of utility I propose is whether we cause people who read
what we've written to do anything differently afterward.  Knowing
we have to give definite (if implicit) advice will keep us from
straying beyond the resolution of the words we're using.<br><br>The goal is the same as Aristotle's; we just approach it from a
different direction.<br><br>As an example of a useful, general idea, consider that of the
controlled experiment.  There's an idea that has turned out to be
widely applicable.  Some might say it's part of science, but it's
not part of any specific science; it's literally meta-physics (in
our sense of "meta").   The idea of evolution is another. It turns
out to have quite broad applications—for example, in genetic
algorithms and even product design.  Frankfurt's distinction between
lying and bullshitting seems a promising recent example.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#999999">15</font></a>]</font><br><br>These seem to me what philosophy should look like: quite general
observations that would cause someone who understood them to do
something differently.<br><br>Such observations will necessarily be about things that are imprecisely
defined.  Once you start using words with precise meanings, you're
doing math.  So starting from utility won't entirely solve the
problem I described above—it won't flush out the metaphysical
singularity.  But it should help.  It gives people with good
intentions a new roadmap into abstraction.  And they may thereby
produce things that make the writing of the people with bad intentions
look bad by comparison.<br><br>One drawback of this approach is that it won't produce the sort of
writing that gets you tenure.  And not just because it's not currently
the fashion.  In order to get tenure in any field you must not
arrive at conclusions that members of tenure committees can disagree
with.  In practice there are two kinds of solutions to this problem.
In math and the sciences, you can prove what you're saying, or at
any rate adjust your conclusions so you're not claiming anything
false ("6 of 8 subjects had lower blood pressure after the treatment").
In the humanities you can either avoid drawing any definite conclusions
(e.g. conclude that an issue is a complex one), or draw conclusions
so narrow that no one cares enough to disagree with you.<br><br>The kind of philosophy I'm advocating won't be able to take either
of these routes.  At best you'll be able to achieve the essayist's
standard of proof, not the mathematician's or the experimentalist's.
And yet you won't be able to meet the usefulness test without
implying definite and fairly broadly applicable conclusions.  Worse
still, the usefulness test will tend to produce results that annoy
people: there's no use in telling people things they already believe,
and people are often upset to be told things they don't.<br><br>Here's the exciting thing, though.  Anyone can do this.  Getting
to general plus useful by starting with useful and cranking up the
generality may be unsuitable for junior professors trying to get
tenure, but it's better for everyone else, including professors who
already have it.  This side of the mountain is a nice gradual slope.
You can start by writing things that are useful but very specific,
and then gradually make them more general.  Joe's has good burritos.
What makes a good burrito?  What makes good food?  What makes
anything good?  You can take as long as you want.  You don't have
to get all the way to the top of the mountain.  You don't have to
tell anyone you're doing philosophy.<br><br>If it seems like a daunting task to do philosophy, here's an
encouraging thought.  The field is a lot younger than it seems.
Though the first philosophers in the western tradition lived about
2500 years ago, it would be misleading to say the field is 2500
years old, because for most of that time the leading practitioners
weren't doing much more than writing commentaries on Plato or
Aristotle while watching over their shoulders for the next invading
army.  In the times when they weren't, philosophy was hopelessly
intermingled with religion.  It didn't shake itself free till a
couple hundred years ago, and even then was afflicted by the
structural problems I've described above.  If I say this, some will
say it's a ridiculously overbroad and uncharitable generalization,
and others will say it's old news, but here goes: judging from their
works, most philosophers up to the present have been wasting their
time.  So in a sense the field is still at the first step. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#999999">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>That sounds a preposterous claim to make.  It won't seem so
preposterous in 10,000 years.  Civilization always seems old, because
it's always the oldest it's ever been.  The only way to say whether
something is really old or not is by looking at structural evidence,
and structurally philosophy is young; it's still reeling from the
unexpected breakdown of words.<br><br>Philosophy is as young now as math was in 1500.  There is a lot
more to discover.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br><!-- (Sorry there are so many notes.  This is a topic with many branches,

In practice formal logic is not much use, because despite
some progress in the last 150 years we're still only able to formalize
a small percentage of statements.  We may never do that much better,
for the same reason 1980s-style "knowledge representation" could
never have worked; many statements may have no representation more
concise than a huge, analog brain state.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
It was harder for Darwin's contemporaries to grasp this than
we can easily imagine.  The story of creation in the Bible is not
just a Judeo-Christian concept; it's roughly what everyone must
have believed since before people were people.  The hard part of
grasping evolution was to realize that species weren't, as they
seem to be, unchanging, but had instead evolved from different,
simpler organisms over unimaginably long periods of time.<br><br>Now we don't have to make that leap.  No one in an industrialized
country encounters the idea of evolution for the first time as an
adult.  Everyone's taught about it as a child, either as truth or
heresy.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Greek philosophers before Plato wrote in verse.  This must
have affected what they said.  If you try to write about the nature
of the world in verse, it inevitably turns into incantation.  Prose
lets you be more precise, and more tentative.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Philosophy is like math's
ne'er-do-well brother.  It was born when Plato and Aristotle looked
at the works of their predecessors and said in effect "why can't
you be more like your brother?"  Russell was still saying the same
thing 2300 years later.<br><br>Math is the precise half of the most abstract ideas, and philosophy
the imprecise half.  It's probably inevitable that philosophy will
suffer by comparison, because there's no lower bound to its precision.
Bad math is merely boring, whereas bad philosophy is nonsense.  And
yet there are <i>some</i> good ideas in the imprecise half.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Aristotle's best work was in logic and zoology, both of which
he can  be said to have invented.  But the most dramatic departure
from his predecessors was a new, much more analytical style of
thinking.  He was arguably the first scientist.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]

Some would say we depend on Aristotle more than we realize,
because his ideas were one of the ingredients in our common culture.
Certainly a lot of the words we use have a connection with Aristotle,
but it seems a bit much to suggest that we wouldn't have the concept
of the essence of something or the distinction between matter and
form if Aristotle hadn't written about them.<br><br>One way to see how much we really depend on Aristotle would be to
diff European culture with Chinese: what ideas did European culture
have in 1800 that Chinese culture didn't, in virtue of Aristotle's
contribution?<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
The meaning of the word "philosophy" has changed over time.
In ancient times it covered a broad range of topics, comparable in
scope to our "scholarship" (though without the methodological
implications).  Even as late as Newton's time it included what we
now call "science."  But core of the subject today is still what
seemed to Aristotle the core: the attempt to discover the most
general truths.<br><br>Aristotle didn't call this "metaphysics."  That name got assigned
to it because the books we now call the <i>Metaphysics</i> came after
(meta = after) the <i>Physics</i> in the standard edition of Aristotle's
works compiled by Andronicus of Rhodes three centuries later.  What
we call "metaphysics" Aristotle called "first philosophy."<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Some of Aristotle's immediate successors may have realized
this, but it's hard to say because most of their works are lost.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]

Wittgenstein asserted a sort of mastery to which the inhabitants
of early 20th century Cambridge seem to have been peculiarly
vulnerable—perhaps partly because so many had been raised religious
and then stopped believing, so had a vacant space in their heads
for someone to tell them what to do (others chose Marx or Cardinal
Newman), and partly because a quiet, earnest place like Cambridge
in that era had no natural immunity to messianic figures, just as

Some introductions to philosophy now take the line that
philosophy is worth studying as a process rather than for any
particular truths you'll learn.  The philosophers whose works they
cover would be rolling in their graves at that.  They hoped they
were doing more than serving as examples of how to argue: they hoped
they were getting results.  Most were wrong, but it doesn't seem
an impossible hope.<br><br>This argument seems to me like someone in 1500 looking at the lack
of results achieved by alchemy and saying its value was as a process.
No, they were going about it wrong.  It turns out it is possible
to transmute lead into gold (though not economically at current
energy prices), but the route to that knowledge was to
backtrack and try another approach.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston,

<p>
October 2007<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a keynote at FOWA in October 2007.)</i><br><br>There's something interesting happening right now.  Startups are
undergoing the same transformation that technology does when it becomes
cheaper.<br><br>It's a pattern we see over and over in technology.  Initially
there's some device that's very expensive and made
in small quantities.  Then someone discovers how to make them cheaply; 
many more get built; and as a result they can be used in new ways.<br><br>Computers are a familiar example.  When I was a kid, computers were
big, expensive machines built one at a time.  Now they're a commodity.
Now we can stick computers in everything.<br><br>This pattern is very old.  Most of the turning
points in economic history are instances of it.  It happened to
steel in the 1850s, and to power in the 1780s.
It happened to cloth manufacture in the thirteenth century, generating
the wealth that later brought about the Renaissance.  Agriculture
itself was an instance of this pattern.<br><br>Now as well as being produced by startups, this pattern
is happening <i>to</i> startups.  It's so cheap to start web startups
that orders of magnitudes more will be started.   If the pattern
holds true, that should cause dramatic changes.<br><br><b>1. Lots of Startups</b><br><br>So my first prediction about the future of web startups is pretty
straightforward: there will be a lot of them.  When starting a
startup was expensive, you had to get the permission of investors
to do it.  Now the only threshold is courage.<br><br>Even that threshold is getting lower, as people watch others take
the plunge and survive.  In the last batch of startups we funded,
we had several founders who said they'd thought of applying before,
but weren't sure and got jobs instead.  It was only after hearing
reports of friends who'd done it that they decided to try it
themselves.<br><br>Starting a startup is hard, but having a 9 to 5 job is hard too,
and in some ways a worse kind of hard.  In a startup you have lots
of worries, but you don't have that feeling that your life is flying
by like you do in a big company.  Plus in a startup you could make
much more money.<br><br>As word spreads that startups work, the number may grow
to a point that would now seem surprising.<br><br>We now think of it as normal to have a job at a company, but this
is the thinnest of historical veneers.  Just two or three
lifetimes ago, most people in what are now called industrialized
countries lived by farming.  So while it may seem surprising to
propose that large numbers of people will change the way they make
a living, it would be more surprising if they didn't.<br><br><b>2. Standardization</b><br><br>When technology makes something dramatically cheaper, standardization
always follows.  When you make things in large volumes you tend
to standardize everything that doesn't need to change.<br><br>At Y Combinator we still only have four people, so we try to
standardize everything.  We could hire employees, but we want to be
forced to figure out how to scale investing.<br><br>We often tell startups to release a minimal version one quickly, 
then let the needs of the users determine what to do
next.  In essense, let the market design the product.  We've
done the same thing ourselves.  We think of the techniques we're
developing for dealing with large numbers of startups as like
software.  Sometimes it literally is software, like 
<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> and
our application system.<br><br>One of the most important things we've been working on standardizing
are investment terms.  Till now investment terms have been
individually negotiated.
This is a problem for founders, because it makes raising money
take longer and cost more in legal fees.  So as well as using the
same paperwork for every deal we do, we've commissioned generic
angel paperwork that all the startups we fund can use for future
rounds.<br><br>Some investors will still want to cook up their own deal terms.
Series A rounds, where you raise a million dollars or more, will
be custom deals for the forseeable future.  But I think angel rounds
will start to be done mostly with standardized agreements.  An angel
who wants to insert a bunch of complicated terms into the agreement
is probably not one you want anyway.<br><br><b>3. New Attitude to Acquisition</b><br><br>Another thing I see starting to get standardized is acquisitions.
As the volume of startups increases, big companies will start to
develop standardized procedures that make acquisitions little
more work than hiring someone.<br><br>Google is the leader here, as in so many areas of technology.  They
buy a lot of startups— more than most people realize, because they
only announce a fraction of them.   And being Google, they're
figuring out how to do it efficiently.<br><br>One problem they've solved is how to think about acquisitions.  For
most companies, acquisitions still carry some stigma of inadequacy.
Companies do them because they have to, but there's usually some
feeling they shouldn't have to—that their own programmers should
be able to build everything they need.<br><br>Google's example should cure the rest of the world of this idea.
Google has by far the best programmers of any public technology
company.  If they don't have a problem doing acquisitions, the
others should have even less problem.  However many Google does,
Microsoft should do ten times as many.<br><br>One reason Google doesn't have a problem with acquisitions
is that they know first-hand the quality of the people they can get
that way.  Larry and Sergey only started Google after making the
rounds of the search engines trying to sell their idea and finding
no takers.  They've <i>been</i> the guys coming in to visit the big
company, so they know who might be sitting across that conference
table from them.<br><br><b>4. Riskier Strategies are Possible</b><br><br>Risk is always proportionate to reward.  The way to get really big
returns is to do things that seem crazy, like starting a new search
engine in 1998, or turning down a billion dollar acquisition offer.<br><br>This has traditionally been a problem in venture funding.  Founders
and investors have different attitudes to risk.  Knowing that risk
is on average proportionate to reward, investors like risky strategies,
while founders, who don't have a big enough sample size to care
what's true on average, tend to be more conservative.<br><br>If startups are easy to start, this conflict goes away, because
founders can start them younger, when it's rational to take more
risk, and can start more startups total in their careers.  When
founders can do lots of startups, they can start to look at the
world in the same portfolio-optimizing way as investors.  And that
means the overall amount of wealth created can be greater, because
strategies can be riskier.<br><br><b>5. Younger, Nerdier Founders</b><br><br>If startups become a cheap commodity, more people will be able to
have them, just as more people could have computers once microprocessors
made them cheap.  And in particular, younger and more technical
founders will be able to start startups than could before.<br><br>Back when it cost a lot to start a startup, you had to convince
investors to let you do it.  And that required very different skills
from actually doing the startup.  If investors were perfect judges,
the two would require exactly the same skills.  But unfortunately
most investors are terrible judges.  I know because I see behind
the scenes what an enormous amount of work it takes to raise money,
and the amount of selling required in an industry is always inversely
proportional to the judgement of the buyers.<br><br>Fortunately, if startups get cheaper to start, there's another way
to convince investors.  Instead of going to venture capitalists
with a business plan and trying to convince them to fund it, you
can get a product launched on a few tens of thousands of dollars
of seed money from us or your uncle, and approach them with a
working company instead of a plan for one.  Then instead of
having to seem smooth and confident, you can just point them to
Alexa.<br><br>This way of convincing investors is better suited to hackers, who
often went into technology in part because they felt uncomfortable
with the amount of fakeness required in other fields.<br><br><b>6. Startup Hubs Will Persist</b><br><br>It might seem that if startups get cheap to start, it will mean the
end of startup hubs like Silicon Valley.  If all you need to start
a startup is rent money, you should be able to do it anywhere.<br><br>This is kind of true and kind of false.  It's true that you can now
<i>start</i> a startup anywhere.  But you have to do more with a
startup than just start it.  You have to make it succeed.  And that
is more likely to happen in a startup hub.<br><br>I've thought a lot about this question, and it seems to me the
increasing cheapness of web startups will if anything increase the
importance of startup hubs.  The value of startup hubs, like centers
for any kind of business, lies in something very old-fashioned:
face to face meetings.  No technology in the immediate future will
replace walking down University Ave and running into a friend who
tells you how to fix a bug that's been bothering you all weekend,
or visiting a friend's startup down the street and ending up in a
conversation with one of their investors.<br><br>The question of whether to be in a startup hub is like the question
of whether to take outside investment.  The question is not whether
you <i>need</i> it, but whether it brings any advantage at all.
Because anything that brings an advantage will give your competitors
an advantage over you if they do it and you don't.  So if you hear
someone saying "we don't need to be in Silicon Valley," that use
of the word "need" is a sign they're not even thinking about the
question right.<br><br>And while startup hubs are as powerful magnets as ever, the increasing
cheapness of starting a startup means the particles they're attracting
are getting lighter.  A startup now can be just a pair of 22 year
old guys.  A company like that can move much more easily than one
with 10 people, half of whom have kids.<br><br>We know because we make people move for Y Combinator, and it doesn't
seem to be a problem. The advantage of being able to work together
face to face for three months outweighs the inconvenience of moving.
Ask anyone who's done it.<br><br>The mobility of seed-stage startups means that seed funding is a
national business.  One of the most common emails we get is from
people asking if we can help them set up a local clone of Y Combinator.
But this just wouldn't work. Seed funding isn't regional, just as
big research universities aren't.<br><br>Is seed funding not merely national, but international?  Interesting
question.  There are signs it may be.  We've had an ongoing
stream of founders from outside the US, and they tend to do
particularly well, because they're all people who were so determined
to succeed that they were willing to move to another country to do
it.<br><br>The more mobile startups get, the harder it would be to start new 
silicon valleys.  If startups are mobile, the best local talent 
will go to the real Silicon Valley,
and all they'll get at the local one will be the people who didn't
have the energy to move.<br><br>This is not a nationalistic idea, incidentally.  It's cities that
compete, not countries.  Atlanta is just as hosed as Munich.<br><br><b>7. Better Judgement Needed</b><br><br>If the number of startups increases dramatically, then the people
whose job is to judge them are going to have to get better at
it.  I'm thinking particularly of investors and acquirers.  We now
get on the order of 1000 applications a year.  What are we going
to do if we get 10,000?<br><br>That's actually an alarming idea.  But we'll figure out some kind
of answer.  We'll have to.  It will probably involve writing some
software, but fortunately we can do that.<br><br>Acquirers will also have to get better at picking winners.   
They generally do better than investors, because they pick
later, when there's more performance to measure.  But even at the
most advanced acquirers, identifying companies to
buy is extremely ad hoc, and completing the acquisition often
involves a great deal of unneccessary friction.<br><br>I think acquirers may eventually have chief acquisition officers
who will both identify good acquisitions and make the deals happen.
At the moment those two functions are separate.  Promising new
startups are often discovered by developers.  If someone powerful
enough wants to buy them, the deal is handed over to corp dev guys
to negotiate.  It would be better if both were combined in
one group, headed by someone with a technical background and some
vision of what they wanted to accomplish.  Maybe in the future big
companies will have both a VP of Engineering responsible for
technology developed in-house, and a CAO responsible for bringing
technology in from outside.<br><br>At the moment, there is no one within big companies who gets in
trouble when they buy a startup for $200 million that they could
have bought earlier for $20 million.  There should start to be
someone who gets in trouble for that.<br><br><b>8. College Will Change</b><br><br>If the best hackers start their own companies after college
instead of getting jobs, that will change what happens in college.
Most of these changes will be for the better.  I think the experience
of college is warped in a bad way by the expectation that afterward
you'll be judged by potential employers.<br><br>One change will be in the meaning of "after
college," which will switch from when one graduates from college
to when one leaves it.  If you're starting your own company, why
do you need a degree?  We don't encourage people to start startups
during college, but the best founders are certainly
capable of it.  Some of the most successful companies we've funded
were started by undergrads.<br><br>I grew up in a time where college degrees seemed really important,
so I'm alarmed to be saying things like this, but there's nothing
magical about a degree.  There's nothing that magically changes
after you take that last exam.  The importance of degrees is due
solely to the administrative needs of large organizations.  These
can certainly affect your life—it's hard to get into grad
school, or to get a work visa in the US, without an undergraduate
degree—but tests like this will matter less and
less.<br><br>As well as mattering less whether students get degrees, it will
also start to matter less where they go to college.  In a startup
you're judged by users, and they don't care where you went to
college.  So in a world of startups, elite universities will play
less of a role as gatekeepers.  In the US it's a national scandal
how easily children of rich parents game college admissions.
But the way this problem ultimately gets solved may not be by
reforming the universities but by going around them.  We in the
technology world are used to that sort of solution: you don't beat
the incumbents; you redefine the problem to make them irrelevant.<br><br>The greatest value of universities is not the brand name or perhaps
even the classes so much as the people you meet.  If
it becomes common to start a startup after college, students may start
trying to maximize this.  Instead of focusing on getting
internships at companies they want to work for, they may start
to focus on working with other students they want as cofounders.<br><br>What students do in their classes will change too.  Instead of
trying to get good grades to impress future employers, students
will try to learn things.  We're talking about some pretty dramatic
changes here.<br><br><b>9. Lots of Competitors</b><br><br>If it gets easier to start a startup, it's easier for competitors too. 
That doesn't erase the advantage of
increased cheapness, however.  You're not all playing a zero-sum
game.  There's not some fixed number of startups that can succeed,
regardless of how many are started.<br><br>In fact, I don't think there's any limit to the number of startups
that could succeed.  Startups succeed by creating wealth, which is
the satisfaction of people's desires.  And people's desires seem
to be effectively infinite, at least in the short term.<br><br>What the increasing number of startups does mean is that you won't
be able to sit on a good idea.  Other people have your idea, and
they'll be increasingly likely to do something about it.<br><br><b>10. Faster Advances</b><br><br>There's a good side to that, at least for consumers of
technology.  If people get right to work implementing ideas instead
of sitting on them, technology will evolve faster.<br><br>Some kinds of innovations happen a company at a time, like the
punctuated equilibrium model of evolution.  There are some kinds
of ideas that are so threatening that it's hard for big companies
even to think of them.  Look at what a hard time Microsoft is
having discovering web apps.  They're like a character in a movie
that everyone in the audience can see something bad is about to
happen to, but who can't see it himself.  The big innovations
that happen a company at a time will obviously happen faster if
the rate of new companies increases.<br><br>But in fact there will be a double speed increase.  People won't
wait as long to act on new ideas, but also those ideas will
increasingly be developed within startups rather than big companies.
Which means technology will evolve faster per company as well.<br><br>Big companies are just not a good place to make things happen fast.
I talked recently to a founder whose startup had been acquired by
a big company.  He was a precise sort of guy, so he'd measured their
productivity before and after.  He counted lines of code, which can
be a dubious measure, but in this case was meaningful because it
was the same group of programmers.  He found they were one thirteenth
as productive after the acquisition.<br><br>The company that bought them was not a particularly stupid one.
I think what he was measuring was mostly the cost of bigness.  I
experienced this myself, and his number sounds about right.  There's
something about big companies that just sucks the energy out of
you.<br><br>Imagine what all that energy could do if it were put to use.  There
is an enormous latent capacity in the world's hackers that most
people don't even realize is there.  That's the main reason we do
Y Combinator: to let loose all this energy by making it easy for
hackers to start their own startups.<br><br><b>A Series of Tubes</b><br><br>The process of starting startups is currently like the plumbing in
an old house.  The pipes are narrow and twisty, and there are leaks
in every joint.  In the future this mess will gradually be replaced
by a single, huge pipe.  The water will still have to get from A
to B, but it will get there faster and without the risk of spraying
out through some random leak.<br><br>This will change a lot of things for the better.  In a big, straight
pipe like that, the force of being measured by one's performance
will propagate back through the whole system.  Performance is always
the ultimate test, but there are so many kinks in the plumbing now
that most people are insulated from it most of the time.  So you
end up with a world in which high school students think they need
to get good grades to get into elite colleges, and college students
think they need to get good grades to impress employers, within
which the employees waste most of their time in political battles,
and from which consumers have to buy anyway because there are so
few choices.  Imagine if that sequence became a big, straight pipe.
Then the effects of being measured by performance would propagate
all the way back to high school, flushing out all the arbitrary
stuff people are measured by now.  That is the future of web startups.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Brian Oberkirch and Simon Willison for inviting me to

<a href="webstartups.html">talk</a> I gave, one of the organizers 
got up on the
stage to deliver an impromptu rebuttal.  That never happened before.
I only heard the first few sentences, but that was enough to tell
what I said that upset him: that startups would do better if they
moved to Silicon Valley.<br><br>This conference was in London, and most of the audience seemed to
be from the UK.  So saying startups should move to Silicon Valley
seemed like a nationalistic remark: an obnoxious American telling
them that if they wanted to do things right they should all just
move to America.<br><br>Actually I'm less American than I seem.  I didn't say so, but I'm
British by birth.  And just as Jews are ex officio allowed to tell
Jewish jokes, I don't feel like I have to bother being diplomatic
with a British audience.<br><br>The idea that startups would do better to move to Silicon Valley
is not even a nationalistic one.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
It's the same thing I say to
startups in the US.  Y Combinator alternates between coasts every
6 months. Every other funding cycle is in Boston.  And even though
Boston is the second biggest startup hub in the US (and the world),
we tell the startups from those cycles that their best bet is to
move to Silicon Valley.  If that's true of Boston, it's even more
true of every other city.<br><br>This is about cities, not countries.<br><br>And I think I can prove I'm right.  You can easily reduce the
opposing argument ad what most people would agree was absurdum.
Few would be willing to claim that it doesn't matter at all where
a startup is—that a startup operating out of a small agricultural
town wouldn't benefit from moving to a startup hub.  Most people
could see how it might be helpful to be in a place where there was
infrastructure for startups, accumulated knowledge about how to
make them work, and other people trying to do it.  And yet whatever
argument you use to prove that startups don't need to move from
London to Silicon Valley could equally well be used to prove startups
don't need to move from smaller towns to London.<br><br>The difference between cities is a matter of degree.  And if, as
nearly everyone who knows agrees, startups are better off in Silicon
Valley than Boston, then they're better off in Silicon Valley than
everywhere else too.<br><br>I realize I might seem to have a vested interest in this conclusion,
because startups that move to the US might do it through Y Combinator.
But the American startups we've funded will attest that I say the
same thing to them.<br><br>I'm not claiming of course that every startup has to go to Silicon
Valley to succeed.  Just that all other things being equal, the
more of a startup hub a place is, the better startups will do there.
But other considerations can outweigh the advantages of moving.
I'm not saying founders with families should uproot them to move
halfway around the world; that might be too much of a distraction.<br><br>Immigration difficulties might be another reason to stay put.
Dealing with immigration problems is like raising money: for some
reason it seems to consume all your attention.  A startup can't
afford much of that.  One Canadian startup we funded spent about 6
months working on moving to the US.  Eventually they just gave up,
because they couldn't afford to take so much time away from working
on their software.<br><br>(If another country wanted to establish a rival to Silicon Valley,
the single best thing they could do might be to create a special
visa for startup founders.  US immigration policy is one of Silicon 
Valley's biggest weaknesses.)<br><br>If your startup is connected to a specific industry, you may be
better off in one of its centers.  A startup doing something related
to entertainment might want to be in New York or LA.<br><br>And finally, if a good investor has committed to fund
you if you stay where you are, you should probably stay.  Finding
investors is hard.  You generally shouldn't pass up a definite
funding offer to move.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>In fact, the quality of the investors may be the main advantage of
startup hubs.  Silicon Valley investors are noticeably more aggressive
than Boston ones.  Over and over, I've seen startups we've funded
snatched by west coast investors out from under the noses of Boston
investors who saw them first but acted too slowly.  At this year's
Boston Demo Day, I told the audience that this happened every year,
so if they saw a startup they liked, they should make them an offer.
And yet within a month it had happened again: an aggressive west
coast VC who had met the founder of a YC-funded startup a week
before beat out a Boston VC who had known him for years.  By the
time the Boston VC grasped what was happening, the deal was already
gone.<br><br>Boston investors will admit they're more conservative.  Some want
to believe this comes from the city's prudent Yankee character.
But Occam's razor suggests the truth is less flattering.  Boston
investors are probably more conservative than Silicon Valley investors
for the same reason Chicago investors are more conservative than
Boston ones.  They don't understand startups as well.<br><br>West coast investors aren't bolder because they're irresponsible
cowboys, or because the good weather makes them optimistic.  They're
bolder because they know what they're doing.  They're the skiers
who ski on the diamond slopes.  Boldness is the essence of venture
investing.  The way you get big returns is not by trying to avoid
losses, but by trying to ensure you get some of the big hits. And
the big hits often look risky at first.<br><br>Like Facebook.  Facebook was started in Boston.  Boston VCs had the
first shot at them.  But they said no, so Facebook moved to Silicon
Valley and raised money there.  The partner who turned them down
now says that "may turn out to have been a mistake."<br><br>Empirically, boldness wins.  If the aggressive ways of west coast
investors are going to come back to bite them, it has been a long
time coming.  Silicon Valley has been pulling ahead of Boston since
the 1970s.  If there was going to be a comeuppance for the west
coast investors, the bursting of the Bubble would have been it.
But since then the west coast has just pulled further ahead.<br><br>West coast investors are confident enough of their judgement to act
boldly; east coast investors, not so much; but anyone who thinks
east coast investors act that way out of prudence should see the
frantic reactions of an east coast VC in the process of losing a
deal to a west coast one.<br><br>In addition to the concentration that comes from specialization,
startup hubs are also markets.  And markets are usually centralized.
Even now, when traders could be anywhere, they cluster in a few
cities.  It's hard to say exactly what it is about face to face
contact that makes deals happen, but whatever it is, it hasn't yet
been duplicated by technology.<br><br>Walk down University Ave at the right time, and you might overhear
five different people talking on the phone about deals.  In fact,
this is part of the reason Y Combinator is in Boston half the time:
it's hard to stand that year round.  But though it can sometimes
be annoying to be surrounded by people who only think about one
thing, it's the place to be if that one thing is what you're trying
to do.<br><br>I was talking recently to someone who works on search at Google.
He knew a lot of people at Yahoo, so he was in a good position to
compare the two companies.  I asked him why Google was better at
search.  He said it wasn't anything specific Google did, but simply
that they understood search so much better.<br><br>And that's why startups thrive in startup hubs like Silicon Valley.
Startups are a very specialized business, as specialized as diamond
cutting.  And in startup hubs they understand it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
The nationalistic idea is the converse: that startups should
stay in a certain city because of the country it's in.  If you
really have a "one world" viewpoint, deciding to move from London
to Silicon Valley is no different from deciding to move from Chicago
to Silicon Valley.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
An investor who merely seems like he will fund you, however,
you can ignore.  Seeming like they will fund you one day is the way
investors say No.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, Harjeet Taggar, and Kulveer

an unexpected consequence: it made me realize I had a design
philosophy.  The main complaint of the more articulate critics was
that Arc seemed so flimsy. After years of working on it, all I had
to show for myself were a few thousand lines of macros?  Why hadn't
I worked on more substantial problems?<br><br>As I was mulling over these remarks it struck me how familiar they
seemed.  This was exactly the kind of thing people said at first
about Viaweb, and Y Combinator, and most of my essays.<br><br>When we launched Viaweb, it seemed laughable to VCs and e-commerce
"experts."  We were just a couple guys in an apartment,
which did not seem cool in 1995 the way it does now.  And the thing
we'd built, as far as they could tell, wasn't even software.
Software, to them, equalled big, honking Windows apps.  Since Viaweb
was the first <xa href="road.html">web-based app 
they'd seen, it seemed to be nothing
more than a website.  They were even more contemptuous when they
discovered that Viaweb didn't process credit card transactions (we
didn't for the whole first year).  Transaction processing seemed
to them what e-commerce was all about.  It sounded serious and
difficult.<br><br>And yet, mysteriously, Viaweb ended up crushing all its competitors.<br><br>The initial reaction to 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> was almost identical.  It
seemed laughably lightweight.  Startup funding meant series A rounds:
millions of dollars given to a small number of startups founded by
people with established credentials after months of serious,
businesslike meetings, on terms described in a document a foot
thick.  Y Combinator seemed inconsequential.  It's too early to say
yet whether Y Combinator will turn out like Viaweb, but judging
from the number of imitations, a lot of people seem to think we're
on to something.<br><br>I can't measure whether my essays are successful, except in page
views, but the reaction to them is at least different from when I
started.  At first the default reaction of the Slashdot trolls was
(translated into articulate terms): "Who is this guy and what
authority does he have to write about these topics?  I haven't read
the essay, but there's no way anything so short and written in such
an informal style could have anything useful to say about such and
such topic, when people with degrees in the subject have already
written many thick books about it." Now there's a new generation
of trolls on a new generation of sites, but they have at least
started to omit the initial "Who is this guy?"<br><br>Now people are saying the same things about Arc that they said at
first about Viaweb and Y Combinator and most of my essays.  Why the
pattern?  The answer, I realized, is that my m.o. for all four has
been the same.<br><br>Here it is: I like to find (a) simple solutions (b) to overlooked
problems (c) that actually need to be solved, and (d) deliver them
as informally as possible, (e) starting with a very crude version
1, then (f) iterating rapidly.<br><br>When I first laid out these principles explicitly, I noticed something
striking: this is practically a recipe for generating a contemptuous
initial reaction.  Though simple solutions are better, they don't
seem as impressive as complex ones.  Overlooked problems are by
definition problems that most people think don't matter.  Delivering
solutions in an informal way means that instead of judging something
by the way it's presented, people have to actually understand it,
which is more work.  And starting with a crude version 1 means your
initial effort is always small and incomplete.<br><br>I'd noticed, of course, that people never seemed to grasp new ideas
at first.  I thought it was just because most people were stupid.
Now I see there's more to it than that.  <!-- This particular m.o. is
practically tuned to hit everyday stupidity square on. --> Like a
contrarian investment fund, someone following this strategy will
almost always be doing things that seem wrong to the average person.<br><br>As with contrarian investment strategies, that's exactly the point.
This technique is successful (in the long term) because it gives you
all the advantages other people forgo by trying to seem legit.  If
you work on overlooked problems, you're more likely to discover new
things, because you have less competition.  If you deliver solutions
informally, you (a) save all the effort you would have had to expend
to make them look impressive, and (b) avoid the danger of fooling
yourself as well as your audience.  And if you release a crude
version 1 then iterate, your solution can benefit from the imagination
of nature, which, as Feynman pointed out, is more powerful than
your own.<br><br>In the case of Viaweb, the simple solution was to make the software
run on the server.  The overlooked problem was to generate web sites
automatically; in 1995, online stores were all made by hand by human
designers, but we knew this wouldn't scale.  The part that actually
mattered was graphic design, not transaction processing.
The informal delivery mechanism was me, showing up in jeans and a
t-shirt at some retailer's office.  And the crude version 1 was,
if I remember correctly, less than 10,000 lines of code when we
launched.<br><br>The power of this technique extends beyond startups and programming
languages and essays.  It probably extends to any kind of creative
work.  Certainly it can be used in painting: this is exactly 
what Cezanne and Klee did.<br><br>At Y Combinator we bet money on it, in the sense that we encourage
the startups we fund to work this way. There are always new ideas
right under your nose.  So look for simple things that other people
have overlooked—things people will later claim were 
"obvious"—especially when they've been led astray by obsolete 
conventions,
or by trying to do things that are superficially impressive.  Figure
out what the real problem is, and make sure you solve that.  Don't
worry about trying to look corporate; the product is what wins in
the long term.  And launch as soon as you can, so you start learning
from users what you should have been making.<br><br><a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> is a classic example of 
this approach.  When Reddit first
launched, it seemed like there was nothing to it.  To the graphically
unsophisticated its deliberately minimal design seemed like no
design at all.  But Reddit solved the real problem, which was to
tell people what was new and otherwise stay out of the way.  As a
result it became massively successful.  Now that conventional ideas
have caught up with it, it seems obvious.  People look at Reddit
and think the founders were lucky.  Like all such things, it was
harder than it looked.  The Reddits pushed so hard against the
current that they reversed it; now it looks like they're merely
floating downstream.<br><br>So when you look at something like Reddit and think "I wish I could
think of an idea like that," remember: ideas like that are all
around you.  But you ignore them because they look wrong.<br><br><br clear="all"></xa></div><div></div><div></div><div><br><br></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=116938">comment</a>
that set me thinking:
<blockquote>
  Something about hacker culture that never really set well with
  me was this � the nastiness. ... I just don't understand why people
  troll like they do.
</blockquote>
I've thought a lot over the last couple years about the problem of
trolls.  It's an old one, as old as forums, but
we're still just learning what the causes are and how to address
them.<br><br>There are two senses of the word "troll."  In the original sense
it meant someone, usually an outsider, who deliberately stirred up
fights in a forum by saying controversial things.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
For example,
someone who didn't use a certain programming language might go to
a forum for users of that language and make disparaging remarks
about it, then sit back and watch as people rose to the bait.  This
sort of trolling was in the nature of a practical joke, like letting
a bat loose in a room full of people.<br><br>The definition then spread to people who behaved like assholes in
forums, whether intentionally or not.  Now when people talk about
trolls they usually mean this broader sense of the word.  Though
in a sense this is historically inaccurate, it is in other ways
more accurate, because when someone is being an asshole it's usually
uncertain even in their own mind how much is deliberate.
That is arguably one of the defining qualities of an asshole.<br><br>I think trolling in the broader sense has four causes.  The most
important is distance.  People will say things in anonymous forums
that they'd never dare say to someone's face, just as they'll do
things in cars that they'd never do as pedestrians � like tailgate
people, or honk at them, or cut them off.<br><br>Trolling tends to be particularly bad in forums related to computers,
and I think that's due to the kind of people you find there.  Most
of them (myself included) are more comfortable dealing with abstract
ideas than with people.  Hackers can be abrupt even in person.  Put
them on an anonymous forum, and the problem gets worse.<br><br>The third cause of trolling is incompetence.  If you disagree with
something, it's easier to say "you suck" than to figure out and
explain exactly what you disagree with.  You're also safe that way
from refutation.  In this respect trolling is a lot like graffiti.
Graffiti happens at the intersection of ambition and incompetence:
people want to make their mark on the world, but have no other way
to do it than literally making a mark on the world.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The final contributing factor is the culture of the forum.  Trolls
are like children (many <i>are</i> children) in that they're capable of
a wide range of behavior depending on what they think will be
tolerated.  In a place where rudeness isn't tolerated, most can be
polite.  But vice versa as well.<br><br>There's a sort of Gresham's Law of trolls: trolls are willing to
use a forum with a lot of thoughtful people in it, but thoughtful
people aren't willing to use a forum with a lot of trolls in it.
Which means that once trolling takes hold, it tends to become the
dominant culture.  That had already happened to Slashdot and Digg by
the time I paid attention to comment threads there, but I watched
it happen to Reddit.<br><br><xa href="http://news.ycombinator.com">News.YC is, among other things, an experiment to see if this fate
can be avoided.  The sites's <a href="http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html">guidelines</a>
explicitly ask people not to say things they wouldn't say face to
face.  If someone starts being rude, other users will step in and
tell them to stop.  And when people seem to be deliberately trolling,
we ban them ruthlessly.<br><br>Technical tweaks may also help.  On Reddit, votes on your comments
don't affect your karma score, but they do on News.YC.  And it does
seem to influence people when they can see their reputation in the
eyes of their peers drain away after making an asshole remark.
Often users have second thoughts and delete such comments.<br><br>One might worry this would prevent people from expressing controversial
ideas, but empirically that doesn't seem to be what happens.  When
people say something substantial that gets modded down, they
stubbornly leave it up.  What people delete are wisecracks, because
they have less invested in them.<br><br>So far the experiment seems to be working.  The level of conversation
on News.YC is as high as on any forum I've seen.  But we still only
have about 8,000 uniques a day.  The conversations on Reddit were
good when it was that small.  The challenge is whether we can keep
things this way.<br><br>I'm optimistic we will.  We're not depending just on technical
tricks.  The core users of News.YC are mostly refugees from other
sites that were overrun by trolls.  They feel about trolls roughly
the way refugees from Cuba or Eastern Europe feel about dictatorships.
So there are a lot of people working to keep this from happening
again.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I mean forum in the general sense of a place to exchange views.
The original Internet forums were not web sites but Usenet newsgroups.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
I'm talking here about everyday tagging.  Some graffiti is
quite impressive (anything becomes art if you do it well enough)
but the median tag is just visual spam.<br><br></xa></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><a href="http://spring.jumpidea.com/2008/08/paul-graham-trolls.html">Russian Translation</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><br><br></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

out what we do.  Even though Y Combinator is now 3 years old, we're still
trying to understand its implications.)</i><br><br>
I was annoyed recently to read a description of Y Combinator that
said "Y Combinator does seed funding for startups."  What was
especially annoying about it was that I wrote it.  This doesn't
really convey what we do.  And the reason it's inaccurate is that,
paradoxically, funding very early stage startups is not mainly about
funding.<br><br>Saying YC does seed funding for startups is a description in terms
of earlier models.  It's like calling a car a horseless carriage.<br><br>When you scale animals you can't just keep everything in proportion.
For example, volume grows as the cube of linear dimension, but
surface area only as the square.  So as animals get bigger they
have trouble radiating heat.  That's why mice and rabbits are furry
and elephants and hippos aren't.  You can't make a mouse by scaling
down an elephant.<br><br>YC represents a new, smaller kind of animal—so much smaller
that all the rules are different.<br><br>Before us, most companies in the startup funding business were
venture capital funds.  VCs generally fund later stage companies
than we do.  And they supply so much money that, even though the
other things they do may be very valuable, it's not that inaccurate
to regard VCs as sources of money.  Good VCs are "smart money," but
they're still money.<br><br>All good investors supply a combination of money and help.  But
these scale differently, just as volume and surface area do.  Late
stage investors supply huge amounts of money and
comparatively little help: when a company about to go public gets
a mezzanine round of $50 million, the deal tends to be almost
entirely about money.  As you move earlier in the venture
funding process, the ratio of help to money increases, because
earlier stage companies have different needs.  Early stage companies
need less money because they're smaller and cheaper to run, but
they need more help because life is so precarious for them.  So
when VCs do a series A round for, say, $2 million, they generally
expect to offer a significant amount of help along with the money.<br><br>Y Combinator occupies the earliest end of the spectrum.  We're at
least one and generally two steps before VC funding.  (Though some
startups go straight from YC to VC, the most common trajectory is
to do an angel round first.)  And what happens at Y Combinator is
as different from what happens in a series A round as a series A
round is from a mezzanine financing.<br><br>At our end, money is almost a negligible factor.  The startup usually
consists of just the founders. Their living expenses are the
company's main expense, and since most founders are under 30, their
living expenses are low.  But at this early stage companies need a
lot of help.  Practically every question is still unanswered.  Some
companies we've funded have been working on their software for a
year or more, but others haven't decided what to work on, or even
who the founders should be.<br><br>When PR people and journalists recount the histories of startups
after they've become big, they always underestimate how uncertain
things were at first.  They're not being deliberately misleading.
When you look at a company like Google, it's hard to imagine they
could once have been small and helpless.  Sure, at one point they
were a just a couple guys in a garage—but even then their
greatness was assured, and all they had to do was roll forward along
the railroad tracks of destiny.<br><br>Far from it.  A lot of startups with just as promising beginnings
end up failing.  Google has such momentum now that it would be hard
for anyone to stop them.  But all it would have taken in the beginning
would have been for two Google employees to focus on the wrong
things for six months, and the company could have died.<br><br>We know, because we've been there, just how vulnerable startups are
in the earliest phases.  Curiously enough, that's why founders tend
to get so rich from them.  Reward is always proportionate to risk,
and very early stage startups are insanely risky.<br><br>What we really do at Y Combinator is get startups launched straight.
One of many metaphors you could use for YC is a steam catapult on
an aircraft carrier.  We get startups airborne.  Barely airborne,
but enough that they can accelerate fast.<br><br>When you're launching planes they have to be set up properly or
you're just launching projectiles.  They have to be pointed straight
down the deck; the wings have to be trimmed properly; the engines
have to be at full power; the pilot has to be ready.  These are the
kind of problems we deal with.  After we fund startups we work
closely with them for three months—so closely in fact that
we insist they move to where we are.  And what we do in those three
months is make sure everything is set up for launch.  If there are
tensions between cofounders we help sort them out.  We get all the
paperwork set up properly so there are no nasty surprises later.
If the founders aren't sure what to focus on first, we try to figure
that out.  If there is some obstacle right in front of them, we
either try to remove it, or shift the startup sideways.  The goal
is to get every distraction out of the way so the founders can use
that time to build (or finish building) something impressive.  And
then near the end of the three months we push the button on the
steam catapult in the form of Demo Day, where the current group of
startups present to pretty much every investor in Silicon Valley.<br><br>Launching companies isn't identical with launching products.  Though
we do spend a lot of time on launch strategies for products, there
are some things that take too long to build for a startup to launch
them before raising their next round of funding.  Several of the
most promising startups we've funded haven't launched their products
yet, but are definitely launched as companies.<br><br>In the earliest stage, startups not only have more questions to
answer, but they tend to be different kinds of questions.  In later
stage startups the questions are about deals, or hiring, or
organization.  In the earliest phase they tend to be about technology
and design.  What do you make?  That's the first problem to solve.
That's why our motto is "Make something people want."  This is
always a good thing for companies to do, but it's even more important
early on, because it sets the bounds for every other question.  Who
you hire, how much money you raise, how you market yourself—they
all depend on what you're making.<br><br>Because the early problems are so much about technology and design,
you probably need to be hackers to do what we do.  While some VCs
have technical backgrounds, I don't know any who still write code.
Their expertise is mostly in business—as it should be, because
that's the kind of expertise you need in the phase between series
A and (if you're lucky) IPO.<br><br>We're so different from VCs that we're really a different kind of
animal.  Can we claim founders are better off as a result of this
new type of venture firm?  I'm pretty sure the answer is yes, because
YC is an improved version of what happened to our startup, and our
case was not atypical.  We started Viaweb with $10,000 in seed money
from our friend Julian.  He was a lawyer and arranged all our
paperwork, so we could just code.  We spent three months building
a version 1, which we then presented to investors to raise more
money.  Sounds familiar, doesn't it?  But YC improves on that
significantly.  Julian knew a lot about law and business, but his
advice ended there; he was not a startup guy.  So we made some basic
mistakes early on.  And when we presented to investors, we presented
to only 2, because that was all we knew.  If we'd had our later
selves to encourage and advise us, and Demo Day to present at, we
would have been in much better shape.  We probably could have raised
money at 3 to 5 times the valuation we did.<br><br>If we take 7% of a company we fund, the founders only have to do
<a href="equity.html">7.5%</a> better in their next round of funding
to end up net ahead.  We certainly manage that.<br><br>So who is our 7% coming out of?  If the founders end up net ahead
it's not coming out of them.  So is it coming out of later stage
investors?  Well, they do end up paying more.  But I think they pay
more because the company is actually more valuable.  And later stage
investors have no problem with that.  The returns of a VC fund
depend on the quality of the companies they invest in, not how
cheaply they can buy stock in them.<br><br>If what we do is useful, why wasn't anyone doing it before?  There
are two answers to that.  One is that people were doing it before,
just haphazardly on a smaller scale.  Before us, seed funding came
primarily from individual angel investors.  Larry and Sergey, for
example, got their seed funding from Andy Bechtolsheim, one of the
founders of Sun.  And because he was a startup guy he probably gave
them useful advice.  But raising money from angel investors is a
hit or miss thing.  It's a sideline for most of them, so they only
do a handful of deals a year and they don't spend a lot of time on
the startups they invest in.  And they're hard to reach, because
they don't want random startups pestering them with business plans.
The Google guys were lucky because they knew someone who knew
Bechtolsheim.  It generally takes a personal introduction with
angels.<br><br>The other reason no one was doing quite what we do is that till
recently it was a lot more expensive to start a startup.  You'll
notice we haven't funded any biotech startups.  That's still
expensive.  But advancing technology has made web startups so cheap
that you really can get a company airborne for $15,000.  If you
understand how to operate a steam catapult, at least.<br><br>So in effect what's happened is that a new ecological niche has
opened up, and Y Combinator is the new kind of animal that has moved
into it.  We're not a replacement for venture capital funds.  We
occupy a new, adjacent niche.  And conditions in our niche are
really quite different.  It's not just that the problems we face
are different; the whole structure of the business is different.
VCs are playing a zero-sum game.  They're all competing for a slice
of a fixed amount of "deal flow," and that explains a lot of their
behavior.  Whereas our m.o. is to create new deal flow, by encouraging
hackers who would have gotten jobs to start their own startups
instead.  We compete more with employers than VCs.<br><br>It's not surprising something like this would happen.  Most fields
become more specialized—more articulated—as they develop,
and startups are certainly an area in which there has been a lot
of development over the past couple decades.  The venture business
in its present form is only about forty years old.  It stands to
reason it would evolve.<br><br>And it's natural that the new niche would at first be described,
even by its inhabitants, in terms of the old one.  But really Y
Combinator is not in the startup funding business.  Really we're
more of a small, furry steam catapult.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris

<p>
March 2008, rev. June 2008<br><br>Technology tends to separate normal from natural.  Our bodies
weren't designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, or
to get so little exercise.  
There may be a similar problem with the way we work: 
a normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour
or sugar is for us physically.<br><br>I began to suspect this after spending several years working 
with startup founders.  I've now worked with over 200 of them, and I've
noticed a definite difference between programmers working on their
own startups and those working for large organizations.
I wouldn't say founders seem happier, necessarily;
starting a startup can be very stressful. Maybe the best way to put
it is to say that they're happier in the sense that your body is
happier during a long run than sitting on a sofa eating
doughnuts.<br><br>Though they're statistically abnormal, startup founders seem to be
working in a way that's more natural for humans.<br><br>I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild that
I'd only seen in zoos before. It was remarkable how different they
seemed. Particularly lions. Lions in the wild seem about ten times
more alive. They're like different animals. I suspect that working
for oneself feels better to humans in much the same way that living
in the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion.
Life in a zoo is easier, but it isn't the life they were designed
for.<br><br>
<b>Trees</b><br><br>What's so unnatural about working for a big company?  The root of
the problem is that humans weren't meant to work in such large
groups.<br><br>Another thing you notice when you see animals in the wild is that
each species thrives in groups of a certain size.  A herd of impalas
might have 100 adults; baboons maybe 20; lions rarely 10.  Humans
also seem designed to work in groups, and what I've read about
hunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my own
experience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8
work well; by 20 they're getting hard to manage; and a group of 50
is really unwieldy.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>
Whatever the upper limit is, we are clearly not meant to work in
groups of several hundred.  And yet—for reasons having more
to do with technology than human nature—a great many people
work for companies with hundreds or thousands of employees.<br><br>Companies know groups that large wouldn't work, so they divide
themselves into units small enough to work together.  But to
coordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.<br><br>These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure.  Your
boss is the point where your group attaches to the tree.  But when
you use this trick for dividing a large group into smaller ones,
something strange happens that I've never heard anyone mention
explicitly.  In the group one level up from yours, your boss
represents your entire group.  A group of 10 managers is not merely
a group of 10 people working together in the usual way.  It's really
a group of groups.  Which means for a group of 10 managers to work
together as if they were simply a group of 10 individuals, the group
working for each manager would have to work as if they were a single
person—the workers and manager would each share only one
person's worth of freedom between them.<br><br>In practice a group of people are never able to act as if they were
one person.  But in a large organization divided into groups in
this way, the pressure is always in that direction.  Each group
tries its best to work as if it were the small group of individuals
that humans were designed to work in.  That was the point of creating
it.  And when you propagate that constraint, the result is that
each person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the
size of the entire tree.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Anyone who's worked for a large organization has felt this.  You
can feel the difference between working for a company with 100
employees and one with 10,000, even if your group has only 10 people.<br><br>
<b>Corn Syrup</b><br><br>A group of 10 people within a large organization is a kind of fake
tribe.  The number of people you interact with is about right.  But
something is missing: individual initiative.  Tribes of hunter-gatherers
have much more freedom.  The leaders have a little more power than other
members of the tribe, but they don't generally tell them what to
do and when the way a boss can.<br><br>It's not your boss's fault.  The real problem is that in the group
above you in the hierarchy, your entire group is one virtual person.
Your boss is just the way that constraint is imparted to you.<br><br>So working in a group of 10 people within a large organization feels
both right and wrong at the same time.   On the surface it feels
like the kind of group you're meant to work in, but something major
is missing.  A job at a big company is like high fructose corn
syrup: it has some of the qualities of things you're meant to like,
but is disastrously lacking in others.<br><br>Indeed, food is an excellent metaphor to explain what's wrong with
the usual sort of job.<br><br>For example, working for a big company is the default thing to do,
at least for programmers.  How bad could it be?  Well, food shows
that pretty clearly.  If you were dropped at a random point in
America today, nearly all the food around you would be bad for you.
Humans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high
fructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil.  And yet if
you analyzed the contents of the average grocery store you'd probably
find these four ingredients accounted for most of the calories.
"Normal" food is terribly bad for you.  The only people who eat
what humans were actually designed to eat are a few Birkenstock-wearing
weirdos in Berkeley.<br><br>If "normal" food is so bad for us, why is it so common?  There are
two main reasons. One is that it has more immediate appeal.  You
may feel lousy an hour after eating that pizza, but eating the first
couple bites feels great.  The other is economies of scale.
Producing junk food scales; producing fresh vegetables doesn't.
Which means (a) junk food can be very cheap, and (b) it's worth
spending a lot to market it.<br><br>If people have to choose between something that's cheap, heavily
marketed, and appealing in the short term, and something that's
expensive, obscure, and appealing in the long term, which do you
think most will choose?<br><br>It's the same with work.  The average MIT graduate wants to work
at Google or Microsoft, because it's a recognized brand, it's safe,
and they'll get paid a good salary right away.  It's the job
equivalent of the pizza they had for lunch.  The drawbacks will
only become apparent later, and then only in a vague sense of
malaise.<br><br>And founders and early employees of startups, meanwhile, are like
the Birkenstock-wearing weirdos of Berkeley:  though a tiny minority
of the population, they're the ones living as humans are meant to.
In an artificial world, only extremists live naturally.<br><br>
<b>Programmers</b><br><br>The restrictiveness of big company jobs is particularly hard on
programmers, because the essence of programming is to build new
things.  Sales people make much the same pitches every day; support
people answer much the same questions; but once you've written a
piece of code you don't need to write it again.  So a programmer
working as programmers are meant to is always making new things.
And when you're part of an organization whose structure gives each
person freedom in inverse proportion to the size of the tree, you're
going to face resistance when you do something new.<br><br>This seems an inevitable consequence of bigness.  It's true even
in the smartest companies.  I was talking recently to a founder who
considered starting a startup right out of college, but went to
work for Google instead because he thought he'd learn more there.
He didn't learn as much as he expected.  Programmers learn by doing,
and most of the things he wanted to do, he couldn't—sometimes
because the company wouldn't let him, but often because the company's
code wouldn't let him.  Between the drag of legacy code, the overhead
of doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictions
imposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try a
fraction of the things he would have liked to.  He said he has
learned much more in his own startup, despite the fact that he has
to do all the company's errands as well as programming, because at
least when he's programming he can do whatever he wants.<br><br>An obstacle downstream propagates upstream.  If you're not allowed
to implement new ideas, you stop having them.  And vice versa: when
you can do whatever you want, you have more ideas about what to do.
So working for yourself makes your brain more powerful in the same
way a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.<br><br>Working for yourself doesn't have to mean starting a startup, of
course.  But a programmer deciding between a regular job at a big
company and their own startup is probably going to learn more doing
the startup.<br><br>You can adjust the amount of freedom you get by scaling the size
of company you work for.  If you start the company, you'll have the
most freedom.  If you become one of the first 10 employees you'll
have almost as much freedom as the founders.  Even a company with
100 people will feel different from one with 1000.<br><br>Working for a small company doesn't ensure freedom.  The tree
structure of large organizations sets an upper bound on freedom,
not a lower bound.  The head of a small company may still choose
to be a tyrant.  The point is that a large organization is compelled
by its structure to be one.<br><br>
<b>Consequences</b><br><br>That has real consequences for both organizations and individuals.
One is that companies will inevitably slow down as they grow larger,
no matter how hard they try to keep their startup mojo.  It's a
consequence of the tree structure that every large organization is
forced to adopt.<br><br>Or rather, a large organization could only avoid slowing down if
they avoided tree structure.  And since human nature limits the
size of group that can work together, the only way I can imagine
for larger groups to avoid tree structure would be to have no
structure: to have each group actually be independent, and to work
together the way components of a market economy do.<br><br>That might be worth exploring.  I suspect there are already some
highly partitionable businesses that lean this way.  But I don't
know any technology companies that have done it.<br><br>There is one thing companies can do short of structuring themselves
as sponges:  they can stay small.  If I'm right, then it really
pays to keep a company as small as it can be at every stage.
Particularly a technology company.  Which means it's doubly important
to hire the best people.  Mediocre hires hurt you twice: they get
less done, but they also make you big, because you need more of
them to solve a given problem.<br><br>For individuals the upshot is the same: aim small.  It will always
suck to work for large organizations, and the larger the organization,
the more it will suck.<br><br>In an <a href="start.html">essay</a> I wrote a couple years ago 
I advised graduating seniors
to work for a couple years for another company before starting their
own.  I'd modify that now.  Work for another company if you want
to, but only for a small one, and if you want to start your own
startup, go ahead.<br><br>The reason I suggested college graduates not start startups immediately
was that I felt most would fail.  And they will.  But ambitious
programmers are better off doing their own thing and failing than
going to work at a big company.  Certainly they'll learn more.  They
might even be better off financially.  A lot of people in their
early twenties get into debt, because their expenses grow even
faster than the salary that seemed so high when they left school.
At least if you start a startup and fail your net worth will be
zero rather than negative.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>We've now funded so many different types of founders that we have
enough data to see patterns, and there seems to be no benefit from
working for a big company.  The people who've worked for a few years
do seem better than the ones straight out of college, but only
because they're that much older.<br><br>The people who come to us from big companies often seem kind of
conservative.  It's hard to say how much is because big companies
made them that way, and how much is the natural conservatism that
made them work for the big companies in the first place.  But
certainly a large part of it is learned.  I know because I've seen
it burn off.<br><br>Having seen that happen so many times is one of the things that
convinces me that working for oneself, or at least for a small
group, is the natural way for programmers to live.  Founders arriving
at Y Combinator often have the downtrodden air of refugees.  Three
months later they're transformed: they have so much more 
<a href="http://paulmckellar.com/photos/03l">confidence</a>
that they seem as if they've grown several inches taller. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
Strange as this sounds, they seem both more worried and happier at the same
time.  Which is exactly how I'd describe the way lions seem in the
wild.<br><br>Watching employees get transformed into founders makes it clear
that the difference between the two is due mostly to environment—and
in particular that the environment in big companies is toxic to
programmers.   In the first couple weeks of working on their own
startup they seem to come to life, because finally they're working
the way people are meant to.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
When I talk about humans being meant or designed to live a
certain way, I mean by evolution.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
It's not only the leaves who suffer.  The constraint propagates
up as well as down.  So managers are constrained too; instead of
just doing things, they have to act through subordinates.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Do not finance your startup with credit cards.  Financing a
startup with debt is usually a stupid move, and credit card debt
stupidest of all.  Credit card debt is a bad idea, period.  It is
a trap set by evil companies for the desperate and the foolish.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
The founders we fund used to be younger (initially we encouraged
undergrads to apply), and the first couple times I saw this I used
to wonder if they were actually getting physically taller.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Ross Boucher, Aaron Iba, Abby

Twenty years ago,
writers wrote and readers read.  The web lets readers respond, and
increasingly they do—in comment threads, on forums, and in their
own blog posts.<br><br>Many who respond to something disagree with it.  That's to be
expected.  Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing.
And when you agree there's less to say.  You could expand on something
the author said, but he has probably already explored the
most interesting implications.  When you disagree you're entering
territory he may not have explored.<br><br>The result is there's a lot more disagreeing going on, especially
measured by the word.  That doesn't mean people are getting angrier.
The structural change in the way we communicate is enough to account
for it.  But though it's not anger that's driving the increase in
disagreement, there's a danger that the increase in disagreement
will make people angrier.  Particularly online, where it's easy to
say things you'd never say face to face.<br><br>If we're all going to be disagreeing more, we should be careful to
do it well.  What does it mean to disagree well?   Most readers can
tell the difference between mere name-calling and a carefully
reasoned refutation, but I think it would help to put names on the
intermediate stages.  So here's an attempt at a disagreement
hierarchy:<br><br>
<b>DH0. Name-calling.</b><br><br>This is the lowest form of disagreement, and probably also the most
common.  We've all seen comments like this:
<blockquote>
  u r a fag!!!!!!!!!!
</blockquote>
But it's important to realize that more articulate name-calling has
just as little weight.  A comment like
<blockquote>
  The author is a self-important dilettante.
</blockquote>
is really nothing more than a pretentious version of "u r a fag."<br><br>
<b>DH1. Ad Hominem.</b><br><br>An ad hominem attack is not quite as weak as mere name-calling.  It
might actually carry some weight.  For example, if a senator wrote
an article saying senators' salaries should be increased, one could
respond:
<blockquote>
  Of course he would say that.  He's a senator.
</blockquote>
This wouldn't refute the author's argument, but it may at least be
relevant to the case.  It's still a very weak form of disagreement,
though.  If there's something wrong with the senator's argument,
you should say what it is; and if there isn't, what difference does
it make that he's a senator?<br><br>Saying that an author lacks the authority to write about a topic
is a variant of ad hominem—and a particularly useless sort, because
good ideas often come from outsiders.  The question is whether the
author is correct or not.  If his lack of authority caused him to
make mistakes, point those out.  And if it didn't, it's not a
problem.<br><br>
<b>DH2. Responding to Tone.</b><br><br>The next level up we start to see responses to the writing, rather
than the writer.  The lowest form of these is to disagree with the
author's tone.  E.g.
<blockquote>
  I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such
  a cavalier fashion.
</blockquote>
Though better than attacking the author, this is still a weak form
of disagreement.  It matters much more whether the author is wrong
or right than what his tone is.  Especially since tone is so hard
to judge.  Someone who has a chip on their shoulder about some topic
might be offended by a tone that to other readers seemed neutral.<br><br>So if the worst thing you can say about something is to criticize
its tone, you're not saying much.  Is the author flippant, but
correct?  Better that than grave and wrong.  And if the author is
incorrect somewhere, say where.<br><br><b>DH3. Contradiction.</b><br><br>In this stage we finally get responses to what was said, rather
than how or by whom.  The lowest form of response to an argument
is simply to state the opposing case, with little or no supporting
evidence.<br><br>This is often combined with DH2 statements, as in:
<blockquote>
  I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such
  a cavalier fashion.  Intelligent design is a legitimate scientific
  theory.
</blockquote>
Contradiction can sometimes have some weight.  Sometimes merely
seeing the opposing case stated explicitly is enough to see that
it's right.  But usually evidence will help.<br><br><b>DH4. Counterargument.</b><br><br>At level 4 we reach the first form of convincing disagreement:
counterargument.  Forms up to this point can usually be ignored as
proving nothing.  Counterargument might prove something.  The problem
is, it's hard to say exactly what.<br><br>Counterargument is contradiction plus reasoning and/or evidence.
When aimed squarely at the original argument, it can be convincing.
But unfortunately it's common for counterarguments to be aimed at
something slightly different.  More often than not, two people
arguing passionately about something are actually arguing about two
different things.  Sometimes they even agree with one another, but
are so caught up in their squabble they don't realize it.<br><br>There could be a legitimate reason for arguing against something
slightly different from what the original author said: when you
feel they missed the heart of the matter.  But when you do that,
you should say explicitly you're doing it.<br><br><b>DH5. Refutation.</b><br><br>The most convincing form of disagreement is refutation.  It's also
the rarest, because it's the most work.  Indeed, the disagreement
hierarchy forms a kind of pyramid, in the sense that the higher you
go the fewer instances you find.<br><br>To refute someone you probably have to quote them.  You have to
find a "smoking gun," a passage in whatever you disagree with that
you feel is mistaken, and then explain why it's mistaken.  If you
can't find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguing
with a straw man.<br><br>While refutation generally entails quoting, quoting doesn't necessarily
imply refutation.  Some writers quote parts of things they disagree
with to give the appearance of legitimate refutation, then follow
with a response as low as DH3 or even DH0.<br><br><b>DH6. Refuting the Central Point.</b><br><br>The force of a refutation depends on what you refute.  The most
powerful form of disagreement is to refute someone's central point.<br><br>Even as high as DH5 we still sometimes see deliberate dishonesty,
as when someone picks out minor points of an argument and refutes
those.  Sometimes the spirit in which this is done makes it more
of a sophisticated form of ad hominem than actual refutation.  For
example, correcting someone's grammar, or harping on minor mistakes
in names or numbers.  Unless the opposing argument actually depends
on such things, the only purpose of correcting them is to
discredit one's opponent.<br><br>Truly refuting something requires one to refute its central point,
or at least one of them.  And that means one has to commit explicitly
to what the central point is.  So a truly effective refutation would
look like:
<blockquote>
  The author's main point seems to be x.  As he says:
<blockquote>
    &lt;quotation&gt;
</blockquote>
  But this is wrong for the following reasons...
</blockquote>
The quotation you point out as mistaken need not be the actual
statement of the author's main point.  It's enough to refute something
it depends upon.<br><br>
<b>What It Means</b><br><br>Now we have a way of classifying forms of disagreement.  What good
is it?  One thing the disagreement hierarchy <i>doesn't</i> give us is
a way of picking a winner.  DH levels merely describe the form of
a statement, not whether it's correct.  A DH6 response could still
be completely mistaken.<br><br>But while DH levels don't set a lower bound on the convincingness
of a reply, they do set an upper bound.  A DH6 response might be
unconvincing, but a DH2 or lower response is always unconvincing.<br><br>The most obvious advantage of classifying the forms of disagreement
is that it will help people to evaluate what they read.  In particular,
it will help them to see through intellectually dishonest arguments.
An eloquent speaker or writer can give the impression of vanquishing
an opponent merely by using forceful words.  In fact that is probably
the defining quality of a demagogue.  By giving names to the different
forms of disagreement, we give critical readers a pin for popping
such balloons.<br><br>Such labels may help writers too.  Most intellectual dishonesty is
unintentional.  Someone arguing against the tone of something he
disagrees with may believe he's really saying something.  Zooming
out and seeing his current position on the disagreement hierarchy
may inspire him to try moving up to counterargument or refutation.<br><br>But the greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that it
will make conversations better, but that it will make the people
who have them happier.  If you study conversations, you find there
is a lot more meanness down in DH1 than up in DH6.  You don't have
to be mean when you have a real point to make.  In fact, you don't
want to.  If you have something real to say, being mean just gets
in the way.<br><br>If moving up the disagreement hierarchy makes people less mean,
that will make most of them happier.  Most people don't really enjoy
being mean; they do it because they can't help it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><div><div><div></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></div><div><br><br><div><h1 id="heroes">Some Heroes</h1><br><br>April 2008<br><br>There are some topics I save up because they'll be so much fun to
write about.  This is one of them: a list of my heroes.<br><br>I'm not claiming this is a list of the <i>n</i> most admirable people.
Who could make such a list, even if they wanted to?<br><br>Einstein isn't on the list, for example, even though he probably
deserves to be on any shortlist of admirable people.  I once asked
a physicist friend if Einstein was really as smart as his fame
implies, and she said that yes, he was.  So why isn't he on the
list?  Because I had to ask.  This is a list of people who've
influenced me, not people who would have if I understood their work.<br><br>My test was to think of someone and ask "is this person my
hero?"  It often returned surprising answers.  For example,
it returned false for Montaigne, who was arguably the inventor of
the essay.  Why?  When I thought
about what it meant to call someone a hero, it meant I'd decide what
to do by asking what they'd do in the same situation.  That's a 
stricter standard than admiration.<br><br>After I made the list, I looked to see if there was a pattern, and
there was, a very clear one.  Everyone on the list had two qualities:
they cared almost excessively about their work, and they were
absolutely honest.  By honest I don't mean trustworthy so much as
that they never pander: they never say or do something because
that's what the audience wants.  They are all fundamentally subversive
for this reason, though they conceal it to varying degrees.<br><br>
<b>Jack Lambert</b><br><br>I grew up in Pittsburgh in the 1970s.  Unless you were there it's
hard to imagine how that town felt about the Steelers.   Locally,
all the news was bad.  The steel industry was dying.  But the
Steelers were the best team in football — and moreover, in a
way that seemed to reflect the personality of the city.  They didn't
do anything fancy.  They just got the job done.<br><br>Other players were more famous: Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, Lynn
Swann.  But they played offense, and you always get more attention
for that.  It seemed to me as a twelve year old football expert
that the best of them all was 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Lambert_(American_football_player)">Jack Lambert</a>.  And what made him so
good was that he was utterly relentless.  He didn't just care about
playing well; he cared almost too much.  He seemed to regard it as
a personal insult when someone from the other team had possession
of the ball on his side of the line of scrimmage.<br><br>The suburbs of Pittsburgh in the 1970s were a pretty dull place.
School was boring.  All the adults around were bored with their
jobs working for big companies. Everything that came to us through
the mass media was (a) blandly uniform and (b) produced elsewhere.
Jack Lambert was the exception.  He was like nothing else I'd seen.<br><br>
<b>Kenneth Clark</b><br><br>Kenneth Clark is the best nonfiction writer I know of, on any
subject.  Most people who write about art history don't really like
art; you can tell from a thousand little signs.  But Clark did, and
not just intellectually, but the way one anticipates a delicious
dinner.<br><br>What really makes him stand out, though, is the quality of his
ideas.  His style is deceptively casual, but there is more in 
his books than in a library
of art monographs.  Reading 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nude-Study-Ideal-Form/dp/0691017883"><i>The Nude</i></a> is like a ride in a
Ferrari.  Just as you're getting settled, you're slammed back in
your seat by the acceleration.  Before you can adjust, you're thrown
sideways as the car screeches into the first turn.  His brain throws
off ideas almost too fast to grasp them.  Finally at the end of the
chapter you come to a halt, with your eyes wide and a big smile on
your face.<br><br>Kenneth Clark was a star in his day, thanks to the documentary
series 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000F0UUKA"><i>Civilisation</i></a>.  And if you read only one book about
art history, 
<a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=clark&amp;sts=t&amp;tn=civilisation"><i>Civilisation</i></a> is the one I'd recommend.  It's
much better than the drab Sears Catalogs of art that undergraduates
are forced to buy for Art History 101.<br><br>
<b>Larry Mihalko</b><br><br>A lot of people have a great teacher at some point in their childhood.
Larry Mihalko was mine.  When I look back it's like there's a line
drawn between third and fourth grade.  After Mr. Mihalko, everything
was different.<br><br>Why?  First of all, he was intellectually curious.  I had a few
other teachers who were smart, but I wouldn't describe them as
intellectually curious.  In retrospect, he was out of place as an
elementary school teacher, and I think he knew it.  That must have
been hard for him, but it was wonderful for us, his students.  His
class was a constant adventure.  I used to like going to school
every day.<br><br>The other thing that made him different was that he liked us.  Kids
are good at telling that.  The other teachers were at best benevolently
indifferent.  But Mr.  Mihalko seemed like he actually wanted to
be our friend.  On the last day of fourth grade, he got out one of
the heavy school record players and played James Taylor's "You've
Got a Friend" to us.  Just call out my name, and you know wherever
I am, I'll come running.  He died at 59 of lung cancer.  I've never
cried like I cried at his funeral.<br><br>
<b>Leonardo</b><br><br>One of the things I've learned about making things that I didn't
realize when I was a kid is that much of the best stuff isn't made
for audiences, but for oneself.  You see paintings and drawings in
museums and imagine they were made for you to look at.  Actually a
lot of the best ones were made as a way of exploring the world, not
as a way to please other people.  The best of these explorations
are sometimes more pleasing than stuff made explicitly to please.<br><br>Leonardo did a lot of things.  One of his most admirable qualities
was that he did so many different things that were admirable.  What
people know of him now is his paintings and his more flamboyant
inventions, like flying machines.  That makes him seem like some
kind of dreamer who sketched artists' conceptions of rocket ships
on the side.  In fact he made a large number of far more practical
technical discoveries.  He was as good an engineer as a painter.<br><br>His most impressive work, to me, is his 
<a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/leonardo-skull.jpg?t=1688221954&amp;">drawings</a>.  They're clearly
made more as a way of studying the world than producing something
beautiful. And yet they can hold their own with any work of art
ever made.  No one else, before or since, was that good when no one
was looking.<br><br>
<b>Robert Morris</b><br><br>Robert Morris has a very unusual quality: he's never wrong.  It
might seem this would require you to be omniscient, but actually
it's surprisingly easy. Don't say anything unless you're fairly
sure of it.  If you're not omniscient, you just don't end up saying
much.<br><br>More precisely, the trick is to pay careful attention to how you
qualify what you say.  By using this trick, Robert has, as far as
I know, managed to be mistaken only once, and that was when he was
an undergrad.  When the Mac came out, he said that little desktop
computers would never be suitable for real hacking.<br><br>It's wrong to call it a trick in his case, though.  If it were a
conscious trick, he would have slipped in a moment of excitement.
With Robert this quality is wired-in.  He has an almost superhuman
integrity.  He's not just generally correct, but also correct about
how correct he is.<br><br>You'd think it would be such a great thing never to be wrong that
everyone would do this.  It doesn't seem like that much extra work
to pay as much attention to the error on an idea as to the idea
itself.  And yet practically no one does.  I know how hard it is,
because since meeting Robert I've tried to do in software what he
seems to do in hardware.<br><br>
<b>P. G. Wodehouse</b><br><br>People are finally starting to admit that Wodehouse was a great
writer.  If you want to be thought a great novelist in your own
time, you have to sound intellectual.  If what you write is popular,
or entertaining, or funny, you're ipso facto suspect.  That makes
Wodehouse doubly impressive, because it meant that to write as he
wanted to, he had to commit to being despised in his own lifetime.<br><br>Evelyn Waugh called him a great writer, but to most people at the
time that would have read as a chivalrous or deliberately perverse
gesture. At the time any random autobiographical novel by a recent
college grad could count on more respectful treatment from the
literary establishment.<br><br>Wodehouse may have begun with simple atoms, but the way he composed
them into molecules was near faultless.  His rhythm in particular.
It makes me self-conscious to write about it.  I can think of only
two other writers who came near him for style: Evelyn Waugh and
Nancy Mitford.  Those three used the English language like they
owned it.<br><br>But Wodehouse has something neither of them did.  He's at ease.
Evelyn Waugh and Nancy Mitford cared what other people thought of
them: he wanted to seem aristocratic; she was afraid she wasn't
smart enough.  But Wodehouse didn't give a damn what anyone thought
of him.  He wrote exactly what he wanted.<br><br>
<b>Alexander Calder</b><br><br>Calder's on this list because he makes me happy.  Can his work stand
up to Leonardo's?  Probably not.  There might not be anything from
the 20th Century that can.  But what was good about Modernism,
Calder had, and had in a way that he made seem effortless.<br><br>What was good about Modernism was its freshness.  Art became stuffy
in the nineteenth century.  The paintings that were popular at the
time were mostly the art equivalent of McMansions—big,
pretentious, and fake.  Modernism meant starting over, making things
with the same earnest motives that children might.  The artists who
benefited most from this were the ones who had preserved a child's
confidence, like Klee and Calder.<br><br>Klee was impressive because he could work in so many different
styles.  But between the two I like Calder better, because his work
seemed happier.  Ultimately the point of art is to engage the viewer.
It's hard to predict what will; often something that seems interesting
at first will bore you after a month.  Calder's 
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/uergevich/7029234689/">sculptures</a> never
get boring.  They just sit there quietly radiating optimism, like
a battery that never runs out.  As far as I can tell from books and
photographs, the happiness of Calder's work is his own happiness
showing through.<br><br>
<b>Jane Austen</b><br><br>Everyone admires Jane Austen.  Add my name to the list.  To me she
seems the best novelist of all time.<br><br>I'm interested in how things work.  When I read most novels, I pay
as much attention to the author's choices as to the story.  But in
her novels I can't see the gears at work.  Though I'd really like
to know how she does what she does, I can't figure it out, because
she's so good that her stories don't seem made up.  I feel like I'm
reading a description of something that actually happened.<br><br>I used to read a lot of novels when I was younger.  I can't read
most anymore, because they don't have enough information in them.
Novels seem so impoverished compared to history and biography.  But 
reading Austen is like reading
nonfiction.  She writes so well you don't even notice her.<br><br>
<b>John McCarthy</b><br><br>John McCarthy invented Lisp, the field of (or at least the term)
artificial intelligence, and was an early member of both of the top
two computer science departments, MIT and Stanford.  No one would
dispute that he's one of the greats, but he's an especial hero to
me because of 
<a href="rootsoflisp.html">Lisp</a>.<br><br>It's hard for us now to understand what a conceptual leap that was
at the time.  Paradoxically, one of the reasons his achievement is
hard to appreciate is that it was so successful.  Practically every
programming language invented in the last 20 years includes ideas
from Lisp, and each year the median language gets more Lisplike.<br><br>In 1958 these ideas were anything but obvious.  In 1958 there seem
to have been two ways of thinking about programming.  Some people
thought of it as math, and proved things about Turing Machines.
Others thought of it as a way to get things done, and designed
languages all too influenced by the technology of the day.  McCarthy
alone bridged the gap.  He designed a language that was math.  But
designed is not really the word; discovered is more like it.<br><br>
<b>The Spitfire</b><br><br>As I was making this list I found myself thinking of people like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Bader">Douglas Bader</a> 
and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._J._Mitchell">R.J. Mitchell</a>
 and 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spitfire-Pilots-Story-Crecy-Cover/dp/0947554726">Jeffrey Quill</a> and I realized
that though all of them had done many things in their lives, there
was one factor above all that connected them: the Spitfire.<br><br>This is supposed to be a list of heroes.  How can a machine be on
it?  Because that machine was not just a machine.  It was a lens
of heroes.  Extraordinary devotion went into it, and extraordinary
courage came out.<br><br>It's a cliche to call World War II a contest between good and evil,
but between fighter designs, it really was.  The Spitfire's original
nemesis, the ME 109, was a brutally practical plane.  It was a
killing machine.  The Spitfire was optimism embodied.  And not just
in its beautiful lines: it was at the edge of what could be
manufactured.  But taking the high road worked.  In the air, beauty
had the edge, just.<br><br>
<b>Steve Jobs</b><br><br>People alive when Kennedy was killed  usually remember exactly where
they were when they heard about it.  I remember exactly where I was
when a friend asked if I'd heard Steve Jobs had cancer.  It was
like the floor dropped out.   A few seconds later she told me that
it was a rare operable type, and that he'd be ok.  But those seconds
seemed long.<br><br>I wasn't sure whether to include Jobs on this list.  A lot of people
at Apple seem to be afraid of him, which is a bad sign.  But he
compels admiration.<br><br>There's no name for what Steve Jobs is, because there hasn't been
anyone quite like him before.  He doesn't design Apple's products
himself.  Historically the closest analogy to what he does are the
great Renaissance patrons of the arts.  As the CEO of a company,
that makes him unique.<br><br>Most CEOs delegate 
<a href="taste.html">taste</a> to a subordinate.
The 
<a href="gh.html">design paradox</a>
 means they're choosing more or less at random.  But Steve
Jobs actually has taste himself — such good taste that he's shown
the world how much more important taste is than they realized.<br><br>
<b>Isaac Newton</b><br><br>Newton has a strange role in my pantheon of heroes: he's the one I
reproach myself with.  He worked on big things, at least for part
of his life.  It's so easy to get distracted working on small stuff.
The questions you're answering are pleasantly familiar.  You get
immediate rewards — in fact, you get bigger rewards in your
time if you work on matters of passing importance.  But I'm
uncomfortably aware that this is the route to well-deserved obscurity.<br><br>To do really great things, you have to seek out questions people
didn't even realize were questions.  There have probably been other
people who did this as well as Newton, for their time, but Newton
is my model of this kind of thought.  I can just begin to understand
what it must have felt like for him.<br><br>You only get one life.  Why not do something huge?  The phrase "paradigm
shift" is overused now, but Kuhn was onto something.  And you know
more are out there, separated from us by what will later seem a
surprisingly thin wall of laziness and stupidity.  If we work like
Newton.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Jackie McDonough for reading drafts of this.<br><br></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><a href="http://www.aoky.net/articles/paul_graham/heroes.htm">Japanese Translation</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><br><br></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

<p>
April 2008<br><br>Umair Haque 
<a href="http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/haque/2008/04/i_agree_and_i.html">wrote</a> recently that the reason there aren't more Googles is
that most startups get bought before they can change the world.
</p><blockquote>
  Google, despite serious interest from Microsoft and Yahoo—what
  must have seemed like lucrative interest at the time—didn't
  sell out. Google might simply have been nothing but Yahoo's or
  MSN's search box.<br><br>Why isn't it? Because Google had a deeply felt sense of purpose:
  a conviction to change the world for the better.
</blockquote>
This has a nice sound to it, but it isn't true. 
Google's founders were willing to sell early on.
They just wanted more than acquirers were willing to pay.<br><br>It was the same with Facebook.  They would have sold, but Yahoo blew it 
by offering too little.<br><br>Tip for acquirers: when a startup turns you down, consider raising
your offer, because there's a good chance the outrageous price they 
want will later seem a bargain. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>From the evidence I've seen so far,
startups that turn down acquisition offers usually end up doing better.  
Not always, but usually there's a bigger offer coming, or
perhaps even an IPO.<br><br>Of course, the reason startups do better when they turn down
acquisition offers is not necessarily that all such offers undervalue
startups.  More likely the reason is that the kind of founders who
have the balls to turn down a big offer also tend to be very
successful.  That spirit is exactly what you want in a startup.<br><br>While I'm sure Larry and Sergey do want to change the world, at
least now, the reason Google survived to become a big, independent
company is the same reason Facebook has so far remained independent:
acquirers underestimated them.<br><br>Corporate M&amp;A is a strange business in that respect.  They consistently
lose the best deals, because turning down reasonable offers is the
most reliable test you could invent for whether a startup will make
it big.<br><br><b>VCs</b><br><br>So what's the real reason there aren't more Googles?  Curiously
enough, it's the same reason Google and Facebook have remained
independent: money guys undervalue the most innovative startups.<br><br>The reason there aren't more Googles is not that investors encourage
innovative startups to sell out, but that they won't even fund them.
I've learned a lot about VCs during the 3 years we've been doing Y
Combinator, because we often have to work quite closely with them.
The most surprising thing I've learned is how conservative they
are.  VC firms present an image of boldly encouraging innovation.
Only a handful actually do, and even they are more conservative in
reality than you'd guess from reading their sites.<br><br>I used to think of VCs as piratical: bold but unscrupulous.  On
closer acquaintance they turn out to be more like bureaucrats.
They're more upstanding than I used to think (the good ones, at
least), but less bold.  Maybe the VC industry has changed.  Maybe
they used to be bolder.  
But I suspect it's the startup world that has
changed, not them.  The low cost of starting a startup means the
average good bet is a riskier one, but most existing VC firms still
operate as if they were investing in hardware startups in 1985.<br><br>Howard Aiken said "Don't worry about people stealing your ideas.
If your ideas are any good, you'll have to ram them down people's
throats." I have a similar feeling when I'm trying to convince VCs
to invest in startups Y Combinator has funded.  They're terrified
of really novel ideas, unless the founders are good enough salesmen
to compensate.<br><br>But it's the bold ideas that generate the biggest returns.  Any
really good new idea will seem bad to most people; otherwise someone
would already be doing it.  And
yet most VCs are driven by consensus, not just within their firms,
but within the VC community.  The biggest factor determining how a
VC will feel about your startup is how other VCs feel about it.  I
doubt they realize it, but this algorithm guarantees they'll miss
all the very best ideas.  The more people who have to like a new
idea, the more outliers you lose.<br><br>Whoever the next Google is, they're probably being told right now
by VCs to come back when they have more "traction."<br><br>Why are VCs so conservative?  It's probably a combination of factors.
The large size of their investments makes them conservative.
Plus they're investing other people's money, which makes
them worry they'll get in trouble if they do something risky and
it fails.  Plus most of them are money guys rather than technical
guys, so they don't understand what the startups they're investing
in do.<br><br><a name="next"><b>What's Next</b></a><br><br>The exciting thing about market economies is that stupidity equals
opportunity.  And so it is in this case.  There is a huge, unexploited
opportunity in startup investing.  Y Combinator funds startups at
the very beginning.  VCs will fund them once they're already starting
to succeed.  But between the two there is a substantial gap.<br><br>There are companies that will give $20k to a startup that has nothing
more than the founders, and there are companies that will give $2
million to a startup that's already taking off,
but there aren't enough investors who will give $200k to a startup
that seems very promising but still has some things to figure out.
This territory is occupied mostly by
individual angel investors—people like Andy Bechtolsheim, who
gave Google $100k when they seemed promising but still had some
things to figure out. I like angels, but there just aren't enough
of them, and investing is for most of them a part time job.<br><br>And yet as it gets cheaper to start startups, this sparsely occupied
territory is becoming more and more valuable.   Nowadays a lot of
startups don't want to raise multi-million dollar series A rounds.
They don't need that much money, and they don't want the hassles
that come with it.  The median startup coming out of Y Combinator
wants to raise $250-500k.  When they go to VC firms they have to
ask for more because they know VCs aren't interested in such small
deals.<br><br>VCs are money managers.  They're looking for ways to put large sums
to work.  But the startup world is evolving away from their current
model.<br><br>Startups have gotten cheaper.  That means they want less money, but
also that there are more of them.  So you can still get large returns
on large amounts of money; you just have to spread it more broadly.<br><br>I've tried to explain this to VC firms.  Instead of making one $2
million investment, make five $400k investments.  Would that mean
sitting on too many boards?  Don't sit on their boards.  Would that
mean too much due diligence?  Do less.  If you're investing at a
tenth the valuation, you only have to be a tenth as sure.<br><br>It seems obvious.  But I've proposed to several VC firms that they
set aside some money and designate one partner to make more, smaller
bets, and they react as if I'd proposed the partners all get nose
rings.  It's remarkable how wedded they are to their standard m.o.<br><br>But there is a big opportunity here, and one way or the other it's
going to get filled.  Either VCs will evolve down into this gap or,
more likely, new investors will appear to fill it.  That will be a
good thing when it happens, because these new investors will be
compelled by the structure of the investments they make to be ten
times bolder than present day VCs.  And that will get us a lot more
Googles.  At least, as long as acquirers remain stupid.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Another tip: If you want to get all that value, don't destroy the
startup after you buy it.  Give the founders enough autonomy that
they can grow the acquisition into what it would have become.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, David Hornik, Jessica

phrase that became our motto: Make something people want.  We've
learned a lot since then, but if I were choosing now that's still
the one I'd pick.<br><br>Another thing we tell founders is not to worry too much about the
business model, at least at first.  Not because making money is
unimportant, but because it's so much easier than building something
great.<br><br>A couple weeks ago I realized that if you put those two ideas
together, you get something surprising.  Make something people want.
Don't worry too much about making money.  What you've got is a
description of a charity.<br><br>When you get an unexpected result like this, it could either be a
bug or a new discovery.  Either businesses aren't supposed to be
like charities, and we've proven by reductio ad absurdum that one
or both of the principles we began with is false.  Or we have a new
idea.<br><br>I suspect it's the latter, because as soon as this thought occurred
to me, a whole bunch of other things fell into place.<br><br><b>Examples</b><br><br>For example, Craigslist.  It's not a charity, but they run it like
one.  And they're astoundingly successful.  When you scan down the
list of most popular web sites, the number of employees at Craigslist
looks like a misprint. Their revenues aren't as high as they could
be, but most startups would be happy to trade places with them.<br><br>In Patrick O'Brian's novels, his captains always try to get upwind
of their opponents.  If you're upwind, you decide when and if to
engage the other ship.  Craigslist is effectively upwind of enormous
revenues.  They'd face some challenges if they wanted to make more,
but not the sort you face when you're tacking upwind, trying to
force a crappy product on ambivalent users by spending ten times
as much on sales as on development.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>I'm not saying startups should aim to end up like Craigslist.
They're a product of unusual circumstances.  But they're a good
model for the early phases.<br><br>Google looked a lot like a charity in the beginning. They didn't
have ads for over a year.  At year 1, Google was indistinguishable
from a nonprofit.  If a nonprofit or government organization had
started a project to index the web, Google at year 1 is the limit
of what they'd have produced.<br><br>Back when I was working on spam filters I thought it would be a
good idea to have a web-based email service with good spam filtering.
I wasn't thinking of it as a company.  I just wanted to keep people
from getting spammed.  But as I thought more about this project, I
realized it would probably have to be a company.  It would cost
something to run, and it would be a pain to fund with grants and
donations.<br><br>That was a surprising realization.  Companies often claim to be
benevolent, but it was surprising to realize there were purely
benevolent projects that had to be embodied as companies to work.<br><br>I didn't want to start another company, so I didn't do it.  But if
someone had, they'd probably be quite rich now.  There was a window
of about two years when spam was increasing rapidly but all the big
email services had terrible filters.  If someone had launched a
new, spam-free mail service, users would have flocked to it.<br><br>Notice the pattern here?  From either direction we get to the same
spot.  If you start from successful startups, you find they often
behaved like nonprofits.  And if you start from ideas for nonprofits,
you find they'd often make good startups.<br><br><b>Power</b><br><br>How wide is this territory?  Would all good nonprofits be good
companies?  Possibly not.  What makes Google so valuable is that
their users have money.  If you make people with money love you,
you can probably get some of it.  But could you also base a successful
startup on behaving like a nonprofit to people who don't have money?
Could you, for example, grow a successful startup out of curing an
unfashionable but deadly disease like malaria?<br><br>I'm not sure, but I suspect that if you pushed this idea, you'd be
surprised how far it would go.  For example, people who apply to Y
Combinator don't generally have much money, and yet we can profit
by helping them, because with our help they could make money.  Maybe
the situation is similar with malaria.  Maybe an organization that
helped lift its weight off a country could benefit from the resulting
growth.<br><br>I'm not proposing this is a serious idea.  I don't know anything
about malaria.  But I've been kicking ideas around long enough to
know when I come across a powerful one.<br><br>One way to guess how far an idea extends is to ask yourself at what
point you'd bet against it.  The thought of betting against benevolence
is alarming in the same way as saying that something is technically
impossible.  You're just asking to be made a fool of, because these
are such powerful forces.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>For example, initially I thought maybe this principle only applied
to Internet startups.  Obviously it worked for Google, but what
about Microsoft?  Surely Microsoft isn't benevolent?  But when I
think back to the beginning, they were.  Compared to IBM they were
like Robin Hood.  When IBM introduced the PC, they thought they
were going to make money selling hardware at high prices.  But by
gaining control of the PC standard, Microsoft opened up the market
to any manufacturer.  Hardware prices plummeted, and lots of people
got to have computers who couldn't otherwise have afforded them.
It's the sort of thing you'd expect Google to do.<br><br>Microsoft isn't so benevolent now.  Now when one thinks of what
Microsoft does to users, all the verbs that come to mind begin with
F.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font> And yet it doesn't seem to pay.
Their stock price has been flat for years.  Back when they were
Robin Hood, their stock price rose like Google's.  Could there be
a connection?<br><br>You can see how there would be.  When you're small, you can't bully
customers, so you have to charm them.  Whereas when you're big you
can maltreat them at will, and you tend to, because it's easier
than satisfying them.  You grow big by being nice, but you can stay
big by being mean.<br><br>You get away with it till the underlying conditions change, and
then all your victims escape.  So "Don't be evil" may be the most
valuable thing Paul Buchheit made for Google, because it may turn
out to be an elixir of corporate youth.  I'm sure they find it
constraining, but think how valuable it will be if it saves them
from lapsing into the fatal laziness that afflicted Microsoft and
IBM.<br><br>The curious thing is, this elixir is freely available to any other
company.  Anyone can adopt "Don't be evil."  The catch is that
people will hold you to it.  So I don't think you're going to see
record labels or tobacco companies using this discovery.<br><br><b>Morale</b><br><br>There's a lot of external evidence that benevolence works.  But how
does it work?  One advantage of investing in a large number of
startups is that you get a lot of data about how they work.  From
what we've seen, being good seems to help startups in three ways:
it improves their morale, it makes other people want to help them,
and above all, it helps them be decisive.<br><br>Morale is tremendously important to a startup—so important
that morale alone is almost enough to determine success.  Startups
are often described as emotional roller-coasters. One minute you're
going to take over the world, and the next you're doomed.  The
problem with feeling you're doomed is not just that it makes you
unhappy, but that it makes you <i>stop working</i>.  So the downhills
of the roller-coaster are more of a self fulfilling prophecy than
the uphills.  If feeling you're going to succeed makes you work
harder, that probably improves your chances of succeeding, but if
feeling you're going to fail makes you stop working, that practically
guarantees you'll fail.<br><br>Here's where benevolence comes in.  If you feel you're really helping
people, you'll keep working even when it seems like your startup
is doomed.  Most of us have some amount of natural benevolence.
The mere fact that someone needs you makes you want to help them.
So if you start the kind of startup where users come back each day,
you've basically built yourself a giant tamagotchi.  You've made
something you need to take care of.<br><br>Blogger is a famous example of a startup that went through really
low lows and survived.  At one point they ran out of money and
everyone left. Evan Williams came in to work the next day, and there
was no one but him.  What kept him going?  Partly that users needed
him.  He was hosting thousands of people's blogs. He couldn't just
let the site die.<br><br>There are many advantages of launching quickly, but the most important
may be that once you have users, the tamagotchi effect kicks in.
Once you have users to take care of, you're forced to figure out
what will make them happy, and that's actually very valuable
information.<br><br>The added confidence that comes from trying to help people can
also help you with investors. One of the founders of 
<a href="http://chatterous.com">Chatterous</a> told 
me recently that he and his cofounder had decided that this service
was something the world needed, so they were going to keep working
on it no matter what, even if they had to move back to Canada and live
in their parents' basements.<br><br>Once they realized this, they stopped caring so much what investors thought
about them.  They still met with them, but they weren't going to
die if they didn't get their money.  And you know what?  The investors
got a lot more interested.  They could sense that the Chatterouses
were going to do this startup with or without them.<br><br>If you're really committed and your startup is cheap to run, you
become very hard to kill.  And practically all startups, even the
most successful, come close to death at some point.  So if doing
good for people gives you a sense of mission that makes you harder
to kill, that alone more than compensates for whatever you lose by
not choosing a more selfish project.<br><br><b>Help</b><br><br>Another advantage of being good is that it makes other people want
to help you.  This too seems to be an inborn trait in humans.<br><br>One of the startups we've funded, <a href="http://octopart.com">Octopart</a>, is currently locked in
a classic battle of good versus evil.  They're a search site for
industrial components.  A lot of people need to search for components,
and before Octopart there was no good way to do it.  That, it turned
out, was no coincidence.<br><br>Octopart built the right way to search for components.  Users like
it and they've been growing rapidly.  And yet for most of Octopart's
life, the biggest distributor, Digi-Key, has been trying to force
them take their prices off the site.  Octopart is sending them
customers for free, and yet Digi-Key is trying to make that traffic
stop.  Why?  Because their current business model depends on
overcharging people who have incomplete information about prices.
They don't want search to work.<br><br>The Octoparts are the nicest guys in the world.  They dropped out
of the PhD program in physics at Berkeley to do this.  They just
wanted to fix a problem they encountered in their research.  Imagine
how much time you could save the world's engineers if they could
do searches online.  So when I hear that a big, evil company is
trying to stop them in order to keep search broken, it makes me
really want to help them. It makes me spend more time on the Octoparts
than I do with most of the other startups we've funded.  It just
made me spend several minutes telling you how great they are.  Why?
Because they're good guys and they're trying to help the world.<br><br>If you're benevolent, people will rally around you: investors,
customers, other companies, and potential employees.  In the long
term the most important may be the potential employees.  I think
everyone knows now that 
<a href="gh.html">good hackers</a> are much better than mediocre
ones.  If you can attract the best hackers to work for you, as
Google has, you have a big advantage.  And the very best hackers
tend to be idealistic.  They're not desperate for a job.  They can
work wherever they want.  So most want to work on things that will
make the world better.<br><br><b>Compass</b><br><br>But the most important advantage of being good is that it acts as
a compass.  One of the hardest parts of doing a startup is that you
have so many choices.  There are just two or three of you, and a
thousand things you could do. How do you decide?<br><br>Here's the answer: Do whatever's best for your users.  You can hold
onto this like a rope in a hurricane, and it will save you if
anything can.  Follow it and it will take you through everything
you need to do.<br><br>It's even the answer to questions that seem unrelated, like how to
convince investors to give you money.  If you're a good salesman,
you could try to just talk them into it.  But the more reliable
route is to convince them through your users: if you make something
users love enough to tell their friends, you grow exponentially,
and that will convince any investor.<br><br>Being good is a particularly useful strategy for making decisions
in complex situations because it's stateless.  It's like telling
the truth.  The trouble with lying is that you have to remember
everything you've said in the past to make sure you don't contradict
yourself.  If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything,
and that's a really useful property in domains where things happen
fast.<br><br>For example, Y Combinator has now invested in 80 startups, 57 of
which are still alive.  (The rest have died or merged or been
acquired.)  When you're trying to advise 57 startups, it turns out
you have to have a stateless algorithm.  You can't have ulterior
motives when you have 57 things going on at once, because you can't
remember them.  So our rule is just to do whatever's best for the
founders.  Not because we're particularly benevolent, but because
it's the only algorithm that works on that scale.<br><br>When you write something telling people to be good, you seem to be
claiming to be good yourself.  So I want to say explicitly that I
am not a particularly good person.  When I was a kid I was firmly
in the camp of bad.  The way adults used the word good, it seemed
to be synonymous with quiet, so I grew up very suspicious of it.<br><br>You know how there are some people whose names come up in conversation
and everyone says "He's <i>such</i> a great guy?"  People never say
that about me.  The best I get is "he means well."  I am not claiming
to be good.  At best I speak good as a second language.<br><br>So I'm not suggesting you be good in the usual sanctimonious way.
I'm suggesting it because it works.  It will work not just as a
statement of "values," but as a guide to strategy,
and even a design spec for software.  Don't just not be evil.  Be
good.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] Fifty years ago
it would have seemed shocking for a public company not to pay
dividends.  Now many tech companies don't.  The markets seem to
have figured out how to value potential dividends.  Maybe that isn't
the last step in this evolution.  Maybe markets will eventually get
comfortable with potential earnings. (VCs already are, and at least
some of them consistently make money.)<br><br>I realize this sounds like the stuff one used to hear about the
"new economy" during the Bubble.  Believe me, I was not drinking
that kool-aid at the time.  But I'm convinced there were some 
<a href="bubble.html">good
ideas</a> buried in Bubble thinking.  For example, it's ok to focus on
growth instead of profits—but only if the growth is genuine.
You can't be buying users; that's a pyramid scheme.   But a company
with rapid, genuine growth is valuable, and eventually markets learn
how to value valuable things.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>] The idea of starting
a company with benevolent aims is currently undervalued, because
the kind of people who currently make that their explicit goal don't
usually do a very good job.<br><br>It's one of the standard career paths of trustafarians to start
some vaguely benevolent business.  The problem with most of them
is that they either have a bogus political agenda or are feebly
executed.  The trustafarians' ancestors didn't get rich by preserving
their traditional culture; maybe people in Bolivia don't want to
either.  And starting an organic farm, though it's at least
straightforwardly benevolent, doesn't help people on the scale that
Google does.<br><br>Most explicitly benevolent projects don't hold themselves sufficiently
accountable.  They act as if having good intentions were enough to
guarantee good effects.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>] Users dislike their
new operating system so much that they're starting petitions to
save the old one.  And the old one was nothing special.  The hackers

I'm not saying we should stop, but
I think we should at least examine which lies we tell and why.<br><br>There may also be a benefit to us.  We were all lied to as kids,
and some of the lies we were told still affect us.  So by studying
the ways adults lie to kids, we may be able to clear our heads of
lies we were told.<br><br>I'm using the word "lie" in a very general sense: not just overt
falsehoods, but also all the more subtle ways we mislead kids.
Though "lie" has negative connotations, I don't mean to suggest we
should never do this—just that we should pay attention when
we do.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>One of the most remarkable things about the way we lie to kids is
how broad the conspiracy is.  All adults know what their culture 
lies to kids about: they're the questions you answer "Ask
your parents."  If a kid asked who won the World Series in 1982
or what the atomic weight of carbon was, you could just tell him.
But if a kid asks you "Is there a God?" or "What's a prostitute?"
you'll probably say "Ask your parents."<br><br>Since we all agree, kids see few cracks in the view of the world
presented to them.  The biggest disagreements are between parents
and schools, but even those are small. Schools are careful what
they say about controversial topics, and if they do contradict what
parents want their kids to believe, parents either pressure the
school into keeping 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=parents+complain+inappropriate+book">quiet</a> or move their kids to a new school.<br><br>The conspiracy is so thorough that most kids who discover it do so
only by discovering internal contradictions in what they're told.
It can be traumatic for the ones who wake up during the operation.
Here's what happened to Einstein:
<blockquote>
  Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached
  the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not
  be true.  The consequence was a positively fanatic freethinking
  coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being
  deceived by the state through lies: it was a crushing impression.
  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
I remember that feeling.  By 15 I was convinced the world was corrupt
from end to end.  That's why movies like <i>The Matrix</i> have such
resonance.  Every kid grows up in a fake world.  In a way it would
be easier if the forces behind it were as clearly differentiated
as a bunch of evil machines, and one could make a clean break just by
taking a pill.<br><br>
<b>Protection</b><br><br>If you ask adults why they lie to kids, the most common reason they
give is to protect them.  And kids do need protecting.  The environment
you want to create for a newborn child will be quite unlike the
streets of a big city.<br><br>That seems so obvious it seems wrong to call it a lie.  It's certainly
not a bad lie to tell, to give a baby the impression the world is
quiet and warm and safe.  But this harmless type of lie can turn
sour if left unexamined.<br><br>Imagine if you tried to keep someone in as protected an environment
as a newborn till age 18.  To mislead someone so grossly about the
world would seem not protection but abuse.  That's an extreme
example, of course; when parents do that sort of thing it becomes
national news.  But you see the same problem on a smaller scale in
the malaise teenagers feel in suburbia.<br><br>The main purpose of suburbia is to provide a protected environment
for children to grow up in.  And it seems great for 10 year olds.
I liked living in suburbia when I was 10.  I didn't notice how
sterile it was.  My whole world was no bigger than a few friends'
houses I bicycled to and some woods I ran around in.  On a log scale
I was midway between crib and globe.  A suburban street was just
the right size.  But as I grew older, suburbia started to feel
suffocatingly fake.<br><br>Life can be pretty good at 10 or 20, but it's often frustrating at
15.  This is too big a problem to solve here, but certainly one
reason life sucks at 15 is that kids are trapped in a world designed
for 10 year olds.<br><br>What do parents hope to protect their children from by raising them
in suburbia?  A friend who moved out of Manhattan said merely that
her 3 year old daughter "saw too much."  Off the top of my head,
that might include: people who are high or drunk, poverty, madness,
gruesome medical conditions, sexual behavior of various degrees of
oddness, and violent anger.<br><br>I think it's the anger that would worry me most if I had a 3 year
old.  I was 29 when I moved to New York and I was surprised even
then.  I wouldn't want a 3 year old to see some of the disputes I
saw.  It would be too frightening.  A lot of the things adults
conceal from smaller children, they conceal because they'd be
frightening, not because they want to conceal the existence of such
things.  Misleading the child is just a byproduct.<br><br>This seems one of the most justifiable types of lying adults do to
kids.  But because the lies are indirect we don't keep a very strict
accounting of them.  Parents know they've concealed the facts about
sex, and many at some point sit their kids down and explain more.
But few tell their kids about the differences between the real world
and the cocoon they grew up in.  Combine this with the confidence
parents try to instill in their kids, and every year you get a new
crop of 18 year olds who think they know how to run the world.<br><br>Don't all 18 year olds think they know how to run the world?  Actually
this seems to be a recent innovation, no more than about 100 years old.
In preindustrial times teenage kids were junior members of the adult
world and comparatively well aware of their shortcomings.  They
could see they weren't as strong or skillful as the village smith.
In past times people lied to kids about some things more than we
do now, but the lies implicit in an artificial, protected environment
are a recent invention.  Like a lot of new inventions, the rich got
this first.  Children of kings and great magnates were the first
to grow up out of touch with the world.  Suburbia means half the
population can live like kings in that respect.<br><br>
<b>Sex (and Drugs)</b><br><br>I'd have different worries about raising teenage kids in New York.
I'd worry less about what they'd see, and more about what they'd
do.  I went to college with a lot of kids who grew up in Manhattan,
and as a rule they seemed pretty jaded.  They seemed to have lost
their virginity at an average of about 14 and by college had tried
more drugs than I'd even heard of.<br><br>The reasons parents don't want their teenage kids having sex are
complex.  There are some obvious dangers: pregnancy and sexually
transmitted diseases.  But those aren't the only reasons parents
don't want their kids having sex.  The average parents of a 14 year
old girl would hate the idea of her having sex even if there were
zero risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.<br><br>Kids can probably sense they aren't being told the whole story.
After all, pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases are just as
much a problem for adults, and they have sex.<br><br>What really bothers parents about their teenage kids having sex?
Their dislike of the idea is so visceral it's probably inborn.  But
if it's inborn it should be universal, and there are plenty of
societies where parents don't mind if their teenage kids have
sex—indeed, where it's normal for 14 year olds to become
mothers.  So what's going on?  There does seem to be a universal
taboo against sex with prepubescent children.  One can imagine
evolutionary reasons for that.  And I think this is the main reason
parents in industrialized societies dislike teenage kids having
sex.  They still think of them as children, even though biologically
they're not, so the taboo against child sex still has force.<br><br>One thing adults conceal about sex they also conceal about drugs:
that it can cause great pleasure.  That's what makes sex and drugs
so dangerous. The desire for them can cloud one's judgement—which
is especially frightening when the judgement being clouded is the
already wretched judgement of a teenage kid.<br><br>Here parents' desires conflict.  Older societies told kids they had
bad judgement, but modern parents want their children to be confident.
This may well be a better plan than the old one of putting them in
their place, but it has the side effect that after having implicitly
lied to kids about how good their judgement is, we then have to lie
again about all the things they might get into trouble with if they
believed us.<br><br>If parents told their kids the truth about sex and drugs, it would
be: the reason you should avoid these things is that you have lousy
judgement.  People with twice your experience still get burned by
them.  But this may be one of those cases where the truth wouldn't
be convincing, because one of the symptoms of bad judgement is
believing you have good judgement.  When you're too weak to lift
something, you can tell, but when you're making a decision impetuously,
you're all the more sure of it.<br><br>
<b>Innocence</b><br><br>Another reason parents don't want their kids having sex is that
they want to keep them innocent.  Adults have a certain model of
how kids are supposed to behave, and it's different from what they
expect of other adults.<br><br>One of the most obvious differences is the words kids are allowed
to use.  Most parents use words when talking to other adults that
they wouldn't want their kids using.  They try to hide even the
existence of these words for as long as they can.  And this is
another of those conspiracies everyone participates in: everyone
knows you're not supposed to swear in front of kids.<br><br>I've never heard more different explanations for anything parents
tell kids than why they shouldn't swear.  Every parent I know forbids
their children to swear, and yet no two of them have the same
justification.  It's clear most start with not wanting kids to
swear, then make up the reason afterward.<br><br>So my theory about what's going on is that the <i>function</i> of
swearwords is to mark the speaker as an adult.  There's no difference
in the meaning of "shit" and "poopoo."  So why should one be ok for
kids to say and one forbidden?  The only explanation is: by definition.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Why does it bother adults so much when kids do things reserved for
adults?   The idea of a foul-mouthed, cynical 10 year old leaning
against a lamppost with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of
his mouth is very disconcerting.  But why?<br><br>One reason we want kids to be innocent is that we're programmed to
like certain kinds of helplessness.  I've several times heard mothers
say they deliberately refrained from correcting their young children's
mispronunciations because they were so cute.  And if you think about
it, cuteness is helplessness. Toys and cartoon characters meant to
be cute always have clueless expressions and stubby, ineffectual
limbs.<br><br>It's not surprising we'd have an inborn desire to love and protect
helpless creatures, considering human offspring are so helpless for
so long.  Without the helplessness that makes kids cute, they'd be
very annoying.  They'd merely seem like incompetent adults.  But
there's more to it than that.  The reason our hypothetical jaded
10 year old bothers me so much is not just that he'd be annoying,
but that he'd have cut off his prospects for growth so early.  To
be jaded you have to think you know how the world works, and any
theory a 10 year old had about that would probably be a pretty
narrow one.<br><br>Innocence is also open-mindedness.  We want kids to be innocent so
they can continue to learn.  Paradoxical as it sounds, there are
some kinds of knowledge that get in the way of other kinds of
knowledge.  If you're going to learn that the world is a brutal
place full of people trying to take advantage of one another, you're
better off learning it last.  Otherwise you won't bother learning
much more.<br><br>Very smart adults often seem unusually innocent, and I don't think
this is a coincidence.  I think they've deliberately avoided learning
about certain things.  Certainly I do.  I used to think I wanted
to know everything.  Now I know I don't.<br><br>
<b>Death</b><br><br>After sex, death is the topic adults lie most conspicuously about
to kids.  Sex I believe they conceal because of deep taboos.  But
why do we conceal death from kids?   Probably because small children
are particularly horrified by it.  They want to feel safe, and death
is the ultimate threat.<br><br>One of the most spectacular lies our parents told us was about the
death of our first cat.  Over the years, as we asked for more
details, they were compelled to invent more, so the story grew quite
elaborate.  The cat had died at the vet's office.  Of what?  Of the
anaesthesia itself.  Why was the cat at the vet's office?  To be
fixed.  And why had such a routine operation killed it?  It wasn't
the vet's fault; the cat had a congenitally weak heart; the anaesthesia
was too much for it; but there was no way anyone could have
known this in advance.  It was not till we were in our twenties
that the truth came out: my sister, then about three, had accidentally
stepped on the cat and broken its back.<br><br>They didn't feel the need to tell us the cat was now happily in cat
heaven.  My parents never claimed that people or animals who died
had "gone to a better place," or that we'd meet them again.  It
didn't seem to harm us.<br><br>My grandmother told us an edited version of the death of my
grandfather.  She said they'd been sitting reading one day, and
when she said something to him, he didn't answer.  He seemed to be
asleep, but when she tried to rouse him, she couldn't.  "He was
gone." Having a heart attack sounded like falling asleep.  Later I
learned it hadn't been so neat, and the heart attack had taken most
of a day to kill him.<br><br>Along with such outright lies, there must have been a lot of changing
the subject when death came up.  I can't remember that, of course,
but I can infer it from the fact that I didn't really grasp I was
going to die till I was about 19.  How could I have missed something
so obvious for so long?  Now that I've seen parents managing the
subject, I can see how: questions about death are gently but firmly
turned aside.<br><br>On this topic, especially, they're met half-way by kids.  Kids often
want to be lied to.  They want to believe they're living in a
comfortable, safe world as much as their parents want them to believe
it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Identity</b><br><br>Some parents feel a strong adherence to an ethnic or religious group
and want their kids to feel it too.  This usually requires two
different kinds of lying: the first is to tell the child that he
or she is an X, and the second is whatever specific lies Xes
differentiate themselves by believing.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Telling a child they have a particular ethnic or religious identity
is one of the stickiest things you can tell them.  Almost anything
else you tell a kid, they can change their mind about later when
they start to think for themselves.  But if you tell a kid they're
a member of a certain group, that seems nearly impossible to shake.<br><br>This despite the fact that it can be one of the most premeditated
lies parents tell.  When parents are of different religions, they'll
often agree between themselves that their children will be "raised
as Xes."  And it works. The kids obligingly grow up considering
themselves as Xes, despite the fact that if their parents had chosen
the other way, they'd have grown up considering themselves as Ys.<br><br>One reason this works so well is the second kind of lie involved.
The truth is common property.  You can't distinguish your group by
doing things that are rational, and believing things that are true.
If you want to set yourself apart from other people, you have to
do things that are arbitrary, and believe things that are false.
And after having spent their whole lives doing things that are arbitrary
and believing things that are false, and being regarded as odd by
"outsiders" on that account, the cognitive dissonance pushing
children to regard themselves as Xes must be enormous.  If they
aren't an X, why are they attached to all these arbitrary beliefs
and customs?  If they aren't an X, why do all the non-Xes call them
one?<br><br>This form of lie is not without its uses.  You can use it to carry
a payload of beneficial beliefs, and they will also become part of
the child's identity.  You can tell the child that in addition to
never wearing the color yellow, believing the world was created by
a giant rabbit, and always snapping their fingers before eating
fish, Xes are also particularly honest and industrious.  Then X
children will grow up feeling it's part of their identity to be
honest and industrious.<br><br>This probably accounts for a lot of the spread of modern religions,
and explains why their doctrines are a combination of the useful
and the bizarre.  The bizarre half is what makes the religion stick,
and the useful half is the payload.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Authority</b><br><br>One of the least excusable reasons adults lie to kids is to maintain
power over them.  Sometimes these lies are truly sinister, like a
child molester telling his victims they'll get in trouble if they
tell anyone what happened to them.  Others seem more innocent; it
depends how badly adults lie to maintain their power, and what they
use it for.<br><br>Most adults make some effort to conceal their flaws from children.
Usually their motives are mixed.  For example, a father who has an
affair generally conceals it from his children.  His motive is
partly that it would worry them, partly that this would introduce
the topic of sex, and partly (a larger part than he would admit)
that he doesn't want to tarnish himself in their eyes.<br><br>If you want to learn what lies are told to kids, read almost any
book written to teach them about "issues."
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
Peter Mayle wrote
one called <i>Why Are We Getting a Divorce?</i>  It begins with the three
most important things to remember about divorce, one of which is:
<blockquote>
  You shouldn't put the blame on one parent, because divorce is
  never only one person's fault.
  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
Really?  When a man runs off with his secretary, is it always partly
his wife's fault?  But I can see why Mayle might have said this.
Maybe it's more important for kids to respect their parents than
to know the truth about them.<br><br>But because adults conceal their flaws, and at the same time insist
on high standards of behavior for kids, a lot of kids grow up feeling
they fall hopelessly short.  They walk around feeling horribly evil
for having used a swearword, while in fact most of the adults around
them are doing much worse things.<br><br>This happens in intellectual as well as moral questions.  The more
confident people are, the more willing they seem to be to answer a
question "I don't know."  Less confident people feel they have to
have an answer or they'll look bad.  My parents were pretty good
about admitting when they didn't know things, but I must have been
told a lot of lies of this type by teachers, because I rarely heard
a teacher say "I don't know" till I got to college.  I remember
because it was so surprising to hear someone say that in front of
a class.<br><br>The first hint I had that teachers weren't omniscient came in sixth
grade, after my father contradicted something I'd learned in school.
When I protested that the teacher had said the opposite, my father
replied that the guy had no idea what he was talking about—that
he was just an elementary school teacher, after all.<br><br><i>Just</i> a teacher?  The phrase seemed almost grammatically ill-formed.
Didn't teachers know everything about the subjects they taught?
And if not, why were they the ones teaching us?<br><br>The sad fact is, US public school teachers don't generally understand
the stuff they're teaching very well.  There are some sterling
exceptions, but as a rule people planning to go into teaching rank
academically near the bottom of the college population.  So the
fact that I still thought at age 11 that teachers were infallible
shows what a job the system must have done on my brain.<br><br>
<b>School</b><br><br>What kids get taught in school is a complex mix of lies.  The most
excusable are those told to simplify ideas to make them easy to
learn.  The problem is, a lot of propaganda gets slipped into the
curriculum in the name of simplification.<br><br>Public school textbooks represent a compromise between what various
powerful groups want kids to be told.  The lies are rarely overt.
Usually they consist either of omissions or of over-emphasizing
certain topics at the expense of others.  The view of history we
got in elementary school was a crude hagiography, with at least one
representative of each powerful group.<br><br>The famous scientists I remember were Einstein, Marie Curie, and
George Washington Carver.   Einstein was a big deal because his
work led to the atom bomb.  Marie Curie was involved with X-rays.
But I was mystified about Carver.  He seemed to have done stuff
with peanuts.<br><br>It's obvious now that he was on the list because he was black (and
for that matter that Marie Curie was on it because she was a woman),
but as a kid I was confused for years about him.  I wonder if it
wouldn't have been better just to tell us the truth: that there
weren't any famous black scientists.  Ranking George Washington
Carver with Einstein misled us not only about science, but about
the obstacles blacks faced in his time.<br><br>As subjects got softer, the lies got more frequent.  By the time
you got to politics and recent history, what we were taught was
pretty much pure propaganda.  For example, we were taught to regard
political leaders as saints—especially the recently martyred
Kennedy and King.  It was astonishing to learn later that they'd
both been serial womanizers, and that Kennedy was a speed freak to
boot.  (By the time King's plagiarism emerged, I'd lost the ability
to be surprised by the misdeeds of famous people.)<br><br>I doubt you could teach kids recent history without teaching them
lies, because practically everyone who has anything to say about
it has some kind of spin to put on it.  Much recent history <i>consists</i>
of spin.  It would probably be better just to teach them metafacts
like that.<br><br>Probably the biggest lie told in schools, though, is that the way
to succeed is through following "the rules."  In fact most such
rules are just hacks to manage large groups efficiently.<br><br>
<b>Peace</b><br><br>Of all the reasons we lie to kids, the most powerful is probably
the same mundane reason they lie to us.<br><br>Often when we lie to people it's not part of any conscious strategy,
but because they'd react violently to the truth.  Kids, almost by
definition, lack self-control.  They react violently to things—and
so they get lied to a lot. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>A few Thanksgivings ago, a friend of mine found himself in a situation
that perfectly illustrates the complex motives we have when we lie
to kids.  As the roast turkey appeared on the table, his alarmingly
perceptive 5 year old son suddenly asked if the turkey had wanted
to die.  Foreseeing disaster, my friend and his wife rapidly
improvised: yes, the turkey had wanted to die, and in fact had lived
its whole life with the aim of being their Thanksgiving dinner.
And that (phew) was the end of that.<br><br>Whenever we lie to kids to protect them, we're usually also lying
to keep the peace.<br><br>One consequence of this sort of calming lie is that we grow up
thinking horrible things are normal.  It's hard for us to feel a
sense of urgency as adults over something we've literally been
trained not to worry about.  When I was about 10 I saw a documentary
on pollution that put me into a panic.  It seemed the planet was
being irretrievably ruined.  I went to my mother afterward to ask
if this was so.  I don't remember what she said, but she made me
feel better, so I stopped worrying about it.<br><br>That was probably the best way to handle a frightened 10 year old.
But we should understand the price.  This sort of lie is one of the
main reasons bad things persist: we're all trained to ignore them.<br><br>
<b>Detox</b><br><br>A sprinter in a race almost immediately enters a state called "oxygen
debt."  His body switches to an emergency source of energy that's
faster than regular aerobic respiration.  But this process builds
up waste products that ultimately require extra oxygen to break
down, so at the end of the race he has to stop and pant for a while
to recover.<br><br>We arrive at adulthood with a kind of truth debt.  We were told a
lot of lies to get us (and our parents) through our childhood.  Some
may have been necessary.  Some probably weren't.  But we all arrive
at adulthood with heads full of lies.<br><br>There's never a point where the adults sit you down and explain all
the lies they told you.  They've forgotten most of them.  So if
you're going to clear these lies out of your head, you're going to
have to do it yourself.<br><br>Few do.  Most people go through life with bits of packing material
adhering to their minds and never know it.  You probably never can
completely undo the effects of lies you were told as a kid, but
it's worth trying.  I've found that whenever I've been able to undo
a lie I was told, a lot of other things fell into place.<br><br>Fortunately, once you arrive at adulthood you get a valuable new
resource you can use to figure out what lies you were told.  You're
now one of the liars.  You get to watch behind the scenes as adults
spin the world for the next generation of kids.<br><br>The first step in clearing your head is to realize how far you are
from a neutral observer.  When I left high school I was, I thought,
a complete skeptic.  I'd realized high school was crap.  I thought
I was ready to question everything I knew.  But among the many other
things I was ignorant of was how much debris there already was in
my head.  It's not enough to consider your mind a blank slate.  You
have to consciously erase it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
One reason I stuck with such a brutally simple word is that
the lies we tell kids are probably not quite as harmless as we
think.  If you look at what adults told children in the past, it's
shocking how much they lied to them.  Like us, they did it with the
best intentions.  So if we think we're as open as one could reasonably
be with children, we're probably fooling ourselves.  Odds are people
in 100 years will be as shocked at some of the lies we tell as we
are at some of the lies people told 100 years ago.<br><br>I can't predict which these will be, and I don't want to write an
essay that will seem dumb in 100 years.  So instead of using special
euphemisms for lies that seem excusable according to present fashions,
I'm just going to call all our lies lies.<br><br>(I have omitted one type: lies told to play games with kids'
credulity.  These range from "make-believe," which is not really a
lie because it's told with a wink, to the frightening lies told by
older siblings.   There's not much to say about these: I wouldn't
want the first type to go away, and wouldn't expect the second type
to.)<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]

If you ask parents why kids shouldn't swear, the less educated
ones usually reply with some question-begging answer like "it's
inappropriate," while the more educated ones come up with elaborate
rationalizations.  In fact the less educated parents seem closer
to the truth.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
As a friend with small children pointed out, it's easy for small
children to consider themselves immortal, because time seems to
pass so slowly for them.  To a 3 year old, a day feels like a month
might to an adult.  So 80 years sounds to him like 2400 years would
to us.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
I realize I'm going to get endless grief for classifying religion
as a type of lie.  Usually people skirt that issue with some
equivocation implying that lies believed for a sufficiently long
time by sufficiently large numbers of people are immune to the usual
standards for truth.  But because I can't predict which lies future
generations will consider inexcusable, I can't safely omit any type
we tell.  Yes, it seems unlikely that religion will be out of fashion
in 100 years, but no more unlikely than it would have seemed to
someone in 1880 that schoolchildren in 1980 would be taught that
masturbation was perfectly normal and not to feel guilty about it.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Unfortunately the payload can consist of bad customs as well
as good ones.  For example, there are certain qualities that some
groups in America consider "acting white."  In fact most of them
could as accurately be called "acting Japanese."  There's nothing
specifically white about such customs. They're common to all cultures
with long traditions of living in cities.  So it is probably a
losing bet for a group to consider behaving the opposite way as
part of its identity.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
In this context, "issues" basically means "things we're going
to lie to them about."  That's why there's a special name for these
topics.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]

The ironic thing is, this is also the main reason kids lie to
adults.  If you freak out when people tell you alarming things,
they won't tell you them.  Teenagers don't tell their parents what
happened that night they were supposed to be staying at a friend's
house for the same reason parents don't tell 5 year olds the truth
about the Thanksgiving turkey.  They'd freak if they knew.<br><br>

It would work for a while, and then I'd gradually find myself
using the Internet on my work computer.  I'm trying other
strategies now, but I think this time I'll wait till I'm sure
they work before writing about them.</i><br><br>May 2008<br><br>Procrastination feeds on distractions.  Most people find it
uncomfortable just to sit and do nothing; you avoid work by doing
something else.<br><br>So one way to beat procrastination is to starve it of distractions.
But that's not as straightforward as it sounds, because there are
people working hard to distract you.  Distraction is not a static
obstacle that you avoid like you might avoid a rock in the road.
Distraction seeks you out.<br><br>Chesterfield described dirt as matter out of place.  Distracting
is, similarly, desirable at the wrong time.  And technology is
continually being refined to produce more and more desirable things.
Which means that as we learn to avoid one class of distractions,
new ones constantly appear, like drug-resistant bacteria.<br><br>Television, for example, has after 50 years of refinement reached
the point where it's like visual crack.  I realized when I was 13
that TV was addictive, so I stopped watching it.  But I read recently
 that the average American watches 
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/0929/076.html">4 hours</a> 
of TV a day.  A quarter
of their life.<br><br>TV is in decline now, but only because people have found even more
addictive ways of wasting time.  And what's especially dangerous
is that many happen at your computer.  This is no accident.  An
ever larger percentage of office workers sit in front of computers
connected to the Internet, and distractions always evolve toward
the procrastinators.<br><br>I remember when computers were, for me at least, exclusively for
work.  I might occasionally dial up a server to get mail or ftp
files, but most of the time I was offline.  All I could do was write
and program.  Now I feel as if someone snuck a television onto my
desk.  Terribly addictive things are just a click away.  Run into
an obstacle in what you're working on?  Hmm, I wonder what's new
online.  Better check.<br><br>After years of carefully avoiding classic time sinks like TV, games,
and Usenet, I still managed to fall prey to distraction, because
I didn't realize that it evolves.  Something that used to be safe,
using the Internet, gradually became more and more dangerous.  Some
days I'd wake up, get a cup of tea and check the news, then check
email, then check the news again, then answer a few emails, then
suddenly notice it was almost lunchtime and I hadn't gotten any real
work done.  And this started to happen more and more often.<br><br>It took me surprisingly long to realize how distracting the Internet
had become, because the problem was intermittent.  I ignored it the
way you let yourself ignore a bug that only appears intermittently.  When
I was in the middle of a project, distractions weren't really a
problem.  It was when I'd finished one project and was deciding
what to do next that they always bit me.<br><br>Another reason it was hard to notice the danger of this new type
of distraction was that social customs hadn't yet caught up with
it.  If I'd spent a whole morning sitting on a sofa watching TV,
I'd have noticed very quickly.  That's a known danger sign, like
drinking alone.  But using the Internet still looked and felt a 
lot like work.<br><br>Eventually, though, it became clear that the Internet had become so much
more distracting that I had to start treating it differently.
Basically, I had to add a new application to my list of known time
sinks: Firefox.<br><br><center>* * *</center><br><br>The problem is a hard one to solve because most people still need
the Internet for some things.  If you drink too much, you can solve
that problem by stopping entirely.  But you can't solve the problem
of overeating by stopping eating.  I couldn't simply avoid the 
Internet entirely, as I'd done with previous time sinks.<br><br>At first I tried rules.  For example, I'd tell myself I was only
going to use the Internet twice a day.  But these schemes never
worked for long.  Eventually something would come up that required
me to use it more than that.  And then I'd gradually slip back
into my old ways.<br><br>Addictive things have to be treated as if they were sentient
adversaries—as if there were a little man in your head always
cooking up the most plausible arguments for doing whatever you're
trying to stop doing.  If you leave a path to it, he'll find it.<br><br>The key seems to be visibility.  The biggest ingredient in most bad habits
is denial.  So you have to make it so that you can't merely <i>slip</i>
into doing the thing you're trying to avoid.  It has to set off
alarms.<br><br>Maybe in the long term the right answer for dealing with Internet
distractions will be 
<a href="http://rescuetime.com">software</a> that watches and controls them.  But
in the meantime I've found a more drastic solution that definitely
works: to set up a separate computer for using the Internet.<br><br>I now leave wifi turned off on my main computer except when I need
to transfer a file or edit a web page, and I have a separate laptop 
on the other side
of the room that I use to check mail or browse the web.  (Irony of
ironies, it's the computer Steve Huffman wrote Reddit on.  When
Steve and Alexis auctioned off their old laptops for charity, I
bought them for the Y Combinator museum.)<br><br>My rule is that I can spend as much time online as I want, as long
as I do it on that computer.  And this turns out to be enough.  When
I have to sit on the other side of the room to check email or browse
the web, I become much more aware of it.  Sufficiently aware, in
my case at least, that it's hard to spend more than about an hour
a day online.<br><br>And my main computer is now freed for work.  If you try this trick,
you'll probably be struck by how different it feels when your
computer is disconnected from the Internet.  It was alarming to me
how foreign it felt to sit in front of a computer that could
only be used for work, because that showed how much time I must
have been wasting.<br><br><i>Wow.  All I can do at this computer is work.  Ok, I better work
then.</i><br><br>That's the good part.  Your old bad habits now help you to work.
You're used to sitting in front of that computer for hours at a

Great cities attract ambitious people.  You can sense it when you
walk around one.  In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you a
message: you could do more; you should try harder.<br><br>The surprising thing is how different these messages can be.  New
York tells you, above all: you should make more money.  There are
other messages too, of course.  You should be hipper.  You should
be better looking.  But the clearest message is that you should be
richer.<br><br>What I like about Boston (or rather Cambridge) is that the message
there is: you should be smarter.  You really should get around to
reading all those books you've been meaning to.<br><br>When you ask what message a city sends, you sometimes get surprising
answers.  As much as they respect brains in Silicon Valley, the
message the Valley sends is: you should be more powerful.<br><br>That's not quite the same message New York sends.  Power matters
in New York too of course, but New York is pretty impressed by a
billion dollars even if you merely inherited it.  In Silicon Valley
no one would care except a few real estate agents.  What matters
in Silicon Valley is how much effect you have on the world.  The
reason people there care about Larry and Sergey is not their wealth
but the fact that they control Google, which affects practically
everyone.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>How much does it matter what message a city sends?  Empirically,
the answer seems to be: a lot. You might think that if you had
enough strength of mind to do great things, you'd be able to transcend
your environment.  Where you live should make at most a couple
percent difference.  But if you look at the historical evidence,
it seems to matter more than that.  Most people who did great things
were clumped together in a few places where that sort of thing was
done at the time.<br><br>You can see how powerful cities are from something I wrote about
<a href="taste.html">earlier</a>: the case of the Milanese Leonardo.  
Practically every
fifteenth century Italian painter you've heard of was from Florence,
even though Milan was just as big.  People in Florence weren't
genetically different, so you have to assume there was someone born
in Milan with as much natural ability as Leonardo.  What happened
to him?<br><br>If even someone with the same natural ability as Leonardo
couldn't beat the force of environment, do you suppose you can?<br><br>I don't.  I'm fairly stubborn, but I wouldn't try to fight this
force.  I'd rather use it.  So I've thought a lot about where to
live.<br><br>I'd always imagined Berkeley would be the ideal place — that
it would basically be Cambridge with good weather.  But when I
finally tried living there a couple years ago, it turned out not
to be.  The message Berkeley sends is: you should live better.  Life
in Berkeley is very civilized.  It's probably the place in America
where someone from Northern Europe would feel most at home.  But
it's not humming with ambition.<br><br>In retrospect it shouldn't have been surprising that a place so
pleasant would attract people interested above all in quality of
life.  Cambridge with good weather, it turns out, is not Cambridge.
The people you find in Cambridge are not there by accident.  You
have to make sacrifices to live there.  It's expensive and somewhat
grubby, and the weather's often bad.  So the kind of people you
find in Cambridge are the kind of people who want to live where the
smartest people are, even if that means living in an expensive,
grubby place with bad weather.<br><br>As of this writing, Cambridge seems to be the intellectual capital
of the world.  I realize that seems a preposterous claim.  What
makes it true is that it's more preposterous to claim about anywhere
else.  American universities currently seem to be the best, judging
from the flow of ambitious students.  And what US city has a stronger
claim?  New York?  A fair number of smart people, but diluted by a
much larger number of neanderthals in suits.  The Bay Area has a
lot of smart people too, but again, diluted;  there are two great
universities, but they're far apart.  Harvard and MIT are practically
adjacent by West Coast standards, and they're surrounded by about
20 other colleges and universities.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Cambridge as a result feels like a town whose main industry is
ideas, while New York's is finance and Silicon Valley's is startups.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>When you talk about cities in the sense we are, what you're really
talking about is collections of people.  For a long time cities
were the only large collections of people, so you could use the two
ideas interchangeably.  But we can see how much things are changing
from the examples I've mentioned.  New York is a classic great city.
But Cambridge is just part of a city, and Silicon Valley is not
even that.  (San Jose is not, as it sometimes claims, the capital
of Silicon Valley.  It's just 178 square miles at one end of it.)<br><br>Maybe the Internet will change things further.  Maybe one day the
most important community you belong to will be a virtual one, and
it won't matter where you live physically.  But I wouldn't bet on
it.  The physical world is very high bandwidth, and some of the
ways cities send you messages are quite subtle.<br><br>One of the exhilarating things about coming back to Cambridge every
spring is walking through the streets at dusk, when you can see
into the houses.  When you walk through Palo Alto in the evening,
you see nothing but the blue glow of TVs.  In Cambridge you see
shelves full of promising-looking books.  Palo Alto was probably
much like Cambridge in 1960, but you'd never guess now that there
was a university nearby.  Now it's just one of the richer neighborhoods
in Silicon Valley. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>A city speaks to you mostly by accident — in things you see
through windows, in conversations you overhear.  It's not something
you have to seek out, but something you can't turn off.  One of the
occupational hazards of living in Cambridge is overhearing the
conversations of people who use interrogative intonation in declarative
sentences.  But on average I'll take Cambridge conversations over
New York or Silicon Valley ones.<br><br>A friend who moved to Silicon Valley in the late 90s said the worst
thing about living there was the low quality of the eavesdropping.
At the time I thought she was being deliberately eccentric. Sure,
it can be interesting to eavesdrop on people, but is good quality
eavesdropping so important that it would affect where you chose to
live?  Now I understand what she meant.  The conversations you
overhear tell you what sort of people you're among.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>No matter how determined you are, it's hard not to be influenced
by the people around you.  It's not so much that you do whatever a
city expects of you, but that you get discouraged when no one around
you cares about the same things you do.<br><br>There's an imbalance between encouragement and discouragement like
that between gaining and losing money.  Most people overvalue
negative amounts of money: they'll work much harder to avoid losing
a dollar than to gain one.  Similarly, although there are plenty of
people strong enough to resist doing something just because that's
what one is supposed to do where they happen to be, there are few
strong enough to keep working on something no one around them cares
about.<br><br>Because ambitions are to some extent incompatible and admiration
is a zero-sum game, each city tends to focus on one type of ambition.
The reason Cambridge is the intellectual capital is not just that
there's a concentration of smart people there, but that there's
nothing <i>else</i> people there care about more.  Professors in
New York and the Bay area are second class citizens — till they
start hedge funds or startups respectively.<br><br>This suggests an answer to a question people in New York have
wondered about since the Bubble: whether New York could grow into
a startup hub to rival Silicon Valley.  One reason that's unlikely
is that someone starting a startup in New York would feel like a
second class citizen. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
There's already something else people in New York admire more.<br><br>In the long term, that could be a bad thing for New York.  The power
of an important new technology does eventually convert to money.
So by caring more about money and less about power than Silicon
Valley, New York is recognizing the same thing, but slower.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
And in fact it has been losing to Silicon Valley at its own game:
the ratio of New York to California residents in the Forbes 400 has
decreased from 1.45 (81:56) when the list was first published in
1982 to .83 (73:88) in 2007.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Not all cities send a message.  Only those that are centers for
some type of ambition do.  And it can be hard to tell exactly what
message a city sends without living there.  I understand the messages
of New York, Cambridge, and Silicon Valley because I've lived for
several years in each of them.  DC and LA seem to send messages
too, but I haven't spent long enough in either to say for sure what
they are.<br><br>The big thing in LA seems to be fame.  There's an A List of people
who are most in demand right now, and what's most admired is to be
on it, or friends with those who are.  Beneath that, the message is
much like New York's, though perhaps with more emphasis on physical
attractiveness.<br><br>In DC the message seems to be that the most important thing is who
you know.  You want to be an insider.  In practice this seems to
work much as in LA.  There's an A List and you want to be on it or
close to those who are.  The only difference is how the A List is
selected.  And even that is not that different.<br><br>At the moment, San Francisco's message seems to be the same as
Berkeley's: you should live better.  But this will change if enough
startups choose SF over the Valley.  During the Bubble that was a
predictor of failure — a self-indulgent choice, like buying
expensive office furniture.  Even now I'm suspicious when startups
choose SF.  But if enough good ones do, it stops being a self-indulgent
choice, because the center of gravity of Silicon Valley will shift
there.<br><br>I haven't found anything like Cambridge for intellectual ambition.
Oxford and Cambridge (England) feel like Ithaca or Hanover: the
message is there, but not as strong.<br><br>Paris was once a great intellectual center.  If you went there in
1300, it might have sent the message Cambridge does now.  But I
tried living there for a bit last year, and the ambitions of the
inhabitants are not intellectual ones.  The message Paris sends now
is: do things with style.  I liked that, actually.  Paris is the
only city I've lived in where people genuinely cared about art.  In
America only a few rich people buy original art, and even the more
sophisticated ones rarely get past judging it by the brand name of
the artist.  But looking through windows at dusk in Paris you can
see that people there actually care what paintings look like.
Visually, Paris has the best eavesdropping I know. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>There's one more message I've heard from cities: in London you can
still (barely) hear the message that one should be more aristocratic.
If you listen for it you can also hear it in Paris, New York, and
Boston.  But this message is everywhere very faint.  It would have
been strong 100 years ago, but now I probably wouldn't have picked
it up at all if I hadn't deliberately tuned in to that wavelength
to see if there was any signal left.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>So far the complete list of messages I've picked up from cities is:
wealth, style, hipness, physical attractiveness, fame, political
power, economic power, intelligence, social class, and quality of
life.<br><br>My immediate reaction to this list is that it makes me slightly
queasy.  I'd always considered ambition a good thing, but I realize
now that was because I'd always implicitly understood it to mean
ambition in the areas I cared about.  When you list everything
ambitious people are ambitious about, it's not so pretty.<br><br>On closer examination I see a couple things on the list that are
surprising in the light of history.  For example, physical
attractiveness wouldn't have been there 100 years ago (though it
might have been 2400 years ago).  It has always mattered for women,
but in the late twentieth century it seems to have started to matter
for men as well.  I'm not sure why — probably some combination
of the increasing power of women, the increasing influence of actors
as models, and the fact that so many people work in offices now:
you can't show off by wearing clothes too fancy to wear in a factory,
so you have to show off with your body instead.<br><br>Hipness is another thing you wouldn't have seen on the list 100
years ago.  Or wouldn't you?  What it means is to know what's what.
So maybe it has simply replaced the component of social class that
consisted of being "au fait."  That could explain why hipness seems
particularly admired in London: it's version 2 of the traditional
English delight in obscure codes that only insiders understand.<br><br>Economic power would have been on the list 100 years ago, but what
we mean by it is changing.  It used to mean the control of vast
human and material resources.  But increasingly it means the ability
to direct the course of technology, and some of the people in a
position to do that are not even rich — leaders of important
open source projects, for example.  The Captains of Industry of
times past had laboratories full of clever people cooking up new
technologies for them.  The new breed are themselves those people.<br><br>As this force gets more attention, another is dropping off the list:
social class.  I think the two changes are related.  Economic power,
wealth, and social class are just names for the same thing at
different stages in its life: economic power converts to wealth,
and wealth to social class.  So the focus of admiration is simply
shifting upstream.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Does anyone who wants to do great work have to live in a great city?
No; all great cities inspire some sort of ambition, but they aren't
the only places that do.  For some kinds of work, all you need is
a handful of talented colleagues.<br><br>What cities provide is an audience, and a funnel for peers.  These
aren't so critical in something like math or physics, where no
audience matters except your peers, and judging ability is sufficiently
straightforward that hiring and admissions committees can do it
reliably.  In a field like math or physics all you need is a
department with the right colleagues in it.  It could be anywhere — in
Los Alamos, New Mexico, for example.<br><br>It's in fields like the arts or writing or technology that the
larger environment matters.  In these the best practitioners aren't
conveniently collected in a few top university departments and
research labs — partly because talent is harder to judge, and
partly because people pay for these things, so one doesn't need to
rely on teaching or research funding to support oneself.  It's in
these more chaotic fields that it helps most to be in a great city:
you need the encouragement of feeling that people around you care
about the kind of work you do, and since you have to find peers for
yourself, you need the much larger intake mechanism of a great city.<br><br>You don't have to live in a great city your whole life to benefit
from it.  The critical years seem to be the early and middle ones
of your career.  Clearly you don't have to grow up in a great city.
Nor does it seem to matter if you go to college in one.  To most
college students a world of a few thousand people seems big enough.
Plus in college you don't yet have to face the hardest kind of
work — discovering new problems to solve.<br><br>It's when you move on to the next and much harder step that it helps
most to be in a place where you can find peers and encouragement.
You seem to be able to leave, if you want, once you've found both.
The Impressionists show the typical pattern: they were born all
over France (Pissarro was born in the Carribbean) and died all over
France, but what defined them were the years they spent together
in Paris.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Unless you're sure what you want to do and where the leading center
for it is, your best bet is probably to try living in several
places when you're young.  You can never tell what message a city
sends till you live there, or even whether it still sends one.
Often your information will be wrong: I tried living in Florence
when I was 25, thinking it would be an art center, but it turned
out I was 450 years too late.<br><br>Even when a city is still a live center of ambition, you won't know
for sure whether its message will resonate with you till you hear
it.  When I moved to New York, I was very excited at first.  It's
an exciting place.  So it took me quite a while to realize I just
wasn't like the people there.  I kept searching for the Cambridge
of New York.  It turned out it was way, way uptown: an hour uptown
by air.<br><br>Some people know at 16 what sort of work they're going to do, but
in most ambitious kids, ambition seems to precede anything specific
to be ambitious about.  They know they want to do something great.
They just haven't decided yet whether they're going to be a rock
star or a brain surgeon.  There's nothing wrong with that.  But it
means if you have this most common type of ambition, you'll probably
have to figure out where to live by trial and error.  You'll
probably have to find the city where you feel at home to know what sort of

This is one of the advantages of not having the universities
in your country controlled by the government.  When governments
decide how to allocate resources, political deal-making causes
things to be spread out geographically.  No central goverment would
put its two best universities in the same town, unless it was the
capital (which would cause other problems).  But scholars seem to
like to cluster together as much as people in any other field, and
when given the freedom to they derive the same advantages from it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There are still a few old professors in Palo Alto, but one by

How many times have you read about startup founders who continued
to live inexpensively as their companies took off?  Who continued
to dress in jeans and t-shirts, to drive the old car they had in
grad school, and so on?  If you did that in New York, people would
treat you like shit.  If you walk into a fancy restaurant in San
Francisco wearing a jeans and a t-shirt, they're nice to you; who
knows who you might be?  Not in New York.<br><br>One sign of a city's potential as a technology center is the number
of restaurants that still require jackets for men.  According to
Zagat's there are none in San Francisco, LA, Boston, or Seattle, 
4 in DC, 6 in Chicago, 8 in London, 13 in New York, and 20 in Paris.<br><br>(Zagat's lists the Ritz Carlton Dining Room in SF as requiring jackets
but I couldn't believe it, so I called to check and in fact they
don't. Apparently there's only one restaurant left on the entire West
Coast that still requires jackets: The French Laundry in Napa Valley.)<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Ideas are one step upstream from economic power, so it's
conceivable that intellectual centers like Cambridge will one day
have an edge over Silicon Valley like the one the Valley has over
New York.<br><br>This seems unlikely at the moment; if anything Boston is falling
further and further behind.  The only reason I even mention the
possibility is that the path from ideas to startups has recently
been getting smoother.  It's a lot easier now for a couple of hackers
with no business experience to start a startup than it was 10 years
ago.  If you extrapolate another 20 years, maybe the balance of
power will start to shift back.  I wouldn't bet on it, but I wouldn't
bet against it either.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
If Paris is where people care most about art, why is New York
the center of gravity of the art business?  Because in the twentieth
century, art as brand split apart from art as stuff.  New York is
where the richest buyers are, but all they demand from art is brand,
and since you can base brand on anything with a sufficiently
identifiable style, you may as well use the local stuff.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston,

 <a href="http://www.omnisio.com/startupschool08/david-heinemeier-hansson-at-startup-school-08">talk</a>
in which he suggested that startup founders
should do things the old fashioned way.  Instead of hoping to get
rich by building a valuable company and then selling stock in a
"liquidity event," founders should start companies that make money
and live off the revenues.<br><br>Sounds like a good plan.  Let's think about the optimal way to do
this.<br><br>One disadvantage of living off the revenues of your company is that
you have to keep running it.  And as anyone who runs their own
business can tell you, that requires your complete attention.  You
can't just start a business and check out once things are going
well, or they stop going well surprisingly fast.<br><br>The main economic motives of startup founders seem to be freedom
and security.  They want enough money that (a) they don't have to
worry about running out of money and (b) they can spend their time
how they want.  Running your own business offers neither.  You
certainly don't have freedom: no boss is so demanding.  Nor do you
have security, because if you stop paying attention to the company,
its revenues go away, and with them your income.<br><br>The best case, for most people, would be if you could hire someone
to manage the company for you once you'd grown it to a certain size.
Suppose you could find a really good manager.  Then you would have
both freedom and security.  You could pay as little attention to
the business as you wanted, knowing that your manager would keep
things running smoothly.  And that being so, revenues would continue
to flow in, so you'd have security as well.<br><br>There will of course be some founders who wouldn't like that idea:
the ones who like running their company so much that there's nothing
else they'd rather do.  But this group must be small.  The way you
succeed in most businesses is to be fanatically attentive
to customers' needs.  What are the odds that your own desires would
coincide exactly with the demands of this powerful, external force?<br><br>Sure, running your own company can be fairly interesting.  Viaweb
was more interesting than any job I'd had before.  And since I made
much more money from it, it offered the highest ratio of income to
boringness of anything I'd done, by orders of magnitude.  But was
it <i>the</i> most interesting work I could imagine doing?  No.<br><br>Whether the number of founders in the same position is asymptotic
or merely large, there are certainly a lot of them.  For them the
right approach would be to hand the company over to a professional
manager eventually, if they could find one who was good enough.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>So far so good.  But what if your manager was hit by a bus?  What
you really want is a management company to run your company for
you.  Then you don't depend on any one person.<br><br>If you own rental property, there are companies you can hire to
manage it for you.  Some will do everything, from finding tenants
to fixing leaks.  Of course, running companies is a lot more
complicated than managing rental property, but let's suppose there
were management companies that could do it for you. They'd charge
a lot, but wouldn't it be worth it?  I'd sacrifice a large percentage
of the income for the extra peace of mind.<br><br>I realize what I'm describing already sounds too good to be true, but I
can think of a way to make it even more attractive.  If
company management companies existed, there would be an additional
service they could offer clients: they could let them insure their
returns by pooling their risk.  After all, even a perfect manager can't save a company
when, as sometimes happens, its whole market dies, just as property
managers can't save you from the building burning down.  But a
company that managed a large enough number of companies could say
to all its clients: we'll combine the revenues from all your
companies, and pay you your proportionate share.<br><br>If such management companies existed, they'd offer the maximum of
freedom and security.  Someone would run your company for you, and
you'd be protected even if it happened to die.<br><br>Let's think about how such a management company might be organized.
The simplest way would be to have a new kind of stock representing
the total pool of companies they were managing.  When you signed
up, you'd trade your company's stock for shares of this pool, in
proportion to an estimate of your company's value that you'd both
agreed upon.  Then you'd automatically get your share of the returns
of the whole pool.<br><br>The catch is that because this kind of trade would be hard to undo,
you couldn't switch management companies.  But there's a way they
could fix that: suppose all the company management companies got
together and agreed to allow their clients to exchange shares in
all their pools.  Then you could, in effect, simultaneously choose
all the management companies to run yours for you, in whatever
proportion you wanted, and change your mind later as often as you
wanted.<br><br>If such pooled-risk company management companies existed, signing
up with one would seem the ideal plan for most people following the
route David advocated.<br><br>Good news: they do exist.  What I've just
described is an acquisition by a public company.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Unfortunately, though public acquirers are structurally identical
to pooled-risk company management companies, they don't think of
themselves that way.  With a property management company, you can
just walk in whenever you want and say "manage my rental property
for me" and they'll do it.  Whereas acquirers are, as of this
writing, extremely fickle.  Sometimes they're in a buying mood and
they'll overpay enormously; other times they're not interested.
They're like property management companies run by madmen.  Or more
precisely, by Benjamin Graham's Mr. Market.<br><br>So while on average public acquirers behave like pooled-risk company
managers, you need a window of several years to get average case
performance.  If you wait long enough (five years, say) you're
likely to hit an up cycle where some acquirer is hot to buy you.
But you can't choose when it happens.<br><br>You can't assume investors will carry you for as long as you might
have to wait. Your company has to make money.  Opinions are divided
about how early to focus on that.  
<a href="http://susanitsa.wordpress.com/2006/11/08/the-joe-kraus-qa-better-late/">Joe Kraus</a> says you should try
charging customers right away.  And yet some of the most successful
startups, including Google, ignored revenue at first and concentrated
exclusively on development.  The answer probably depends on the
type of company you're starting.  I can imagine some where trying
to make sales would be a good heuristic for product design, and
others where it would just be a distraction.  The test is probably
whether it helps you to understand your users.<br><br>You can choose whichever revenue strategy you think is best for the
type of company you're starting, so long as you're profitable.
Being profitable ensures you'll get at least the average of the
acquisition market—in which public companies do behave as pooled-risk
company management companies.<br><br>David isn't mistaken in saying you should start a company to live
off its revenues.  The mistake is thinking this is somehow opposed
to starting a company and selling it.  In fact, for most people the
latter is merely the optimal case of the former.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Michael

<p>
August 2008<br><br>Raising money is the second hardest part of starting a startup.
The hardest part is making something people want: most startups
that die, die because they didn't do that.  But the second biggest
cause of death is probably the difficulty of raising money.
Fundraising is brutal.<br><br>One reason it's so brutal is simply the brutality of markets.  People
who've spent most of their lives in schools or big companies may
not have been exposed to that.  Professors and bosses usually feel
some sense of responsibility toward you; if you make a valiant
effort and fail, they'll cut you a break.  Markets are less forgiving.
Customers don't care how hard you worked, only whether you solved
their problems.<br><br>Investors evaluate startups the way customers evaluate products,
not the way bosses evaluate employees.  If you're making a valiant
effort and failing, maybe they'll invest in your next startup, but
not this one.<br><br>But raising money from investors is harder than selling to
customers, because there are so few of them.  There's
nothing like an efficient market.  You're unlikely to have more
than 10 who are interested; it's difficult to talk to more.  So the
randomness of any one investor's behavior can really affect you.<br><br>Problem number 3: investors are very random.  All investors, including
us, are by ordinary standards incompetent.  We constantly have to
make decisions about things we don't understand, and more often
than not we're wrong.<br><br>And yet a lot is at stake.  The amounts invested by different types
of investors vary from five thousand dollars to fifty million, but
the amount usually seems large for whatever type of investor it is.
Investment decisions are big decisions.<br><br>That combination—making big decisions about things they don't
understand—tends to make investors very skittish.  VCs are notorious
for leading founders on.  Some of the more unscrupulous do it
deliberately.  But even the most well-intentioned investors can
behave in a way that would seem crazy in everyday life.  One day
they're full of enthusiasm and seem ready to write you a check on
the spot; the next they won't return your phone calls.  They're not
playing games with you.  They just can't make up their minds.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>If that weren't bad enough, these wildly fluctuating nodes are all
linked together.  Startup investors all know one another, and (though
they hate to admit it) the biggest factor in their opinion of you
is the opinion of other investors.

an unstable system.  You get the opposite of the damping that the
fear/greed balance usually produces in markets.  No one is interested
in a startup that's a "bargain" because everyone else hates it.<br><br>So the inefficient market you get because there are so few players
is exacerbated by the fact that they act less than independently.
The result is a system like some kind of primitive, multi-celled
sea creature, where you irritate one extremity and the whole thing
contracts violently.<br><br>Y Combinator is working to fix this.  We're trying to increase the
number of investors just as we're increasing the number of startups.
We hope that as the number of both increases we'll get something
more like an efficient market.  As t approaches infinity, Demo Day
approaches an auction.<br><br>Unfortunately, t is still very far from infinity.  What does a
startup do now, in the imperfect world we currently inhabit? The
most important thing is not to let fundraising get you down.  Startups
live or die on morale.  If you let the difficulty of raising money
destroy your morale, it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br><br>
<b>Bootstrapping (= Consulting)</b><br><br>Some would-be founders may by now be thinking, why deal with investors
at all?  If raising money is so painful, why do it?<br><br>One answer to that is obvious: because you need money to live on.
It's a fine idea in principle to finance your startup with its own
revenues, but you can't create instant customers.  Whatever you
make, you have to sell a certain amount to break even.  It will
take time to grow your sales to that point, and it's hard to predict,
till you try, how long it will take.<br><br>We could not have bootstrapped Viaweb, for example.  We charged
quite a lot for our software—about $140 per user per month—but
it was at least a year before our revenues would have covered even
our paltry costs.  We didn't have enough saved to live on for a
year.<br><br>If you factor out the "bootstrapped" companies that were actually
funded by their founders through savings or a day job, the remainder
either (a) got really lucky, which is hard to do on demand, or (b)
began life as consulting companies and gradually transformed
themselves into product companies.<br><br>Consulting is the only option you can count on.  But consulting is
far from free money.  It's not as painful as raising money from
investors, perhaps, but the pain is spread over a longer period.
Years, probably.  And for many types of startup, that delay could
be fatal.  If you're working on something so unusual that no one
else is likely to think of it, you can take your time.  Joshua
Schachter gradually built Delicious on the side while working on
Wall Street.  He got away with it because no one else realized it
was a good idea.  But if you were building something as obviously
necessary as online store software at about the same time as Viaweb,
and you were working on it on the side while spending most of your
time on client work, you were not in a good position.<br><br>Bootstrapping sounds great in principle, but this apparently verdant
territory is one from which few startups emerge alive.  The mere
fact that bootstrapped startups tend to be famous on that account
should set off alarm bells.  If it worked so well, it would be the
norm.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>
Bootstrapping may get easier, because starting a company is getting
cheaper.  But I don't think we'll ever reach the point where most
startups can do without outside funding.  Technology tends to
get dramatically cheaper, but living expenses don't.<br><br>The upshot is, you can choose your pain: either the short, sharp
pain of raising money, or the chronic ache of consulting.  For a
given total amount of pain, raising money is the better choice,
because new technology is usually more valuable now than later.<br><br>But although for most startups raising money will be the lesser
evil, it's still a pretty big evil—so big that it can easily kill
you.  Not merely in the obvious sense that if you fail to raise
money you might have to shut the company down, but because the
<i>process</i> of raising money itself can kill you.<br><br>To survive it you need a set of techniques mostly
orthogonal to the ones used in convincing investors, just as mountain
climbers need to know survival techniques that are mostly orthogonal
to those used in physically getting up and down mountains.<br><br>
<b>1. Have low expectations.</b><br><br>The reason raising money destroys so many startups' morale is not
simply that it's hard, but that it's so much harder than they
expected.  What kills you is the disappointment.  And the lower
your expectations, the harder it is to be disappointed.<br><br>Startup founders tend to be optimistic.  This can work well in
technology, at least some of the time, but it's the wrong way to
approach raising money.  Better to assume investors will always let
you down.  Acquirers too, while we're at it.  At YC one of our
secondary mantras is "Deals fall through."  No matter what deal
you have going on, assume it will fall through.  The predictive
power of this simple rule is amazing.<br><br>There will be a tendency, as a deal progresses, to start to believe
it will happen, and then to depend on it happening.  You must resist
this.  Tie yourself to the mast.  This is what kills you.  Deals
do not have a trajectory like most other human interactions, where
shared plans solidify linearly over time.  Deals often fall through
at the last moment.  Often the other party doesn't really think
about what they want till the last moment.  So you can't use your
everyday intuitions about shared plans as a guide.  When it comes
to deals, you have to consciously turn them off and become
pathologically cynical.<br><br>This is harder to do than it sounds.  It's very flattering when
eminent investors seem interested in funding you.  It's easy to
start to believe that raising money will be quick and straightforward.
But it hardly ever is.<br><br>
<b>2. Keep working on your startup.</b><br><br>It sounds obvious to say that you should keep working on your startup
while raising money.  Actually this is hard to do.  Most startups
don't manage to.<br><br>Raising money has a mysterious capacity to suck up all your attention.
Even if you only have one meeting a day with investors, somehow
that one meeting will burn up your whole day.  It costs not just
the time of the actual meeting, but the time getting there and back,
and the time preparing for it beforehand and thinking about it
afterward.<br><br>The best way to survive the distraction of meeting with investors
is probably to partition the company: to pick one founder to deal
with investors while the others keep the company going.  This works
better when a startup has 3 founders than 2, and better when the
leader of the company is not also the lead developer.  In the best
case, the company keeps moving forward at about half speed.<br><br>That's the best case, though.  More often than not the company comes
to a standstill while raising money.  And that is dangerous for so
many reasons.  Raising money always takes longer than you expect.
What seems like it's going to be a 2 week interruption turns into
a 4 month interruption.  That can be very demoralizing.  And worse
still, it can make you less attractive to investors.  They want to
invest in companies that are dynamic.  A company that hasn't done
anything new in 4 months doesn't seem dynamic, so they start to
lose interest.  Investors rarely grasp this, but much of what
they're responding to when they lose interest in a startup is the
damage done by their own indecision.<br><br>The solution: put the startup first.  Fit meetings with investors
into the spare moments in your development schedule, rather than
doing development in the spare moments between meetings with
investors.  If you keep the company moving forward—releasing new
features, increasing traffic, doing deals, getting written 
about—those investor meetings are more likely to be productive.  Not just
because your startup will seem more alive, but also because it will
be better for your own morale, which is one of the main ways investors
judge you.<br><br>
<b>3. Be conservative.</b><br><br>As conditions get worse, the optimal strategy becomes more conservative.
When things go well you can take risks; when things are bad you
want to play it safe.<br><br>I advise approaching fundraising as if it were always going badly.
The reason is that between your ability to delude yourself and the
wildly unstable nature of the system you're dealing with, things
probably either already are or could easily become much worse than
they seem.<br><br>What I tell most startups we fund is that if someone reputable
offers you funding on reasonable terms, take it.  There have been
startups that ignored this advice and got away with it—startups
that ignored a good offer in the hope of getting a better one, and
actually did.  But in the same position I'd give the same advice
again.  Who knows how many bullets were in the gun they were playing
Russian roulette with?<br><br>Corollary: if an investor seems interested, don't just let them
sit. You can't assume someone interested in investing will stay
interested.  In fact, you can't even tell (<i>they</i> can't even tell)
if they're really interested till you try to convert that interest
into money.  So if you have hot prospect, either close them now or
write them off.  And unless you already have enough funding, that
reduces to: close them now.<br><br>Startups don't win by getting great funding rounds, but by making
great products.  So finish raising money and get
back to work.<br><br>
<b>4. Be flexible.</b><br><br>There are two questions VCs ask that you shouldn't answer: "Who
else are you talking to?" and "How much are you trying to raise?"<br><br>VCs don't expect you to answer the first question. They ask it just
in case. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
They do seem to expect an answer to the second.  But
I don't think you should just tell them a number.  Not as a way to
play games with them, but because you shouldn't <i>have</i> a fixed
amount you need to raise.<br><br>The custom of a startup needing a fixed amount of funding is an
obsolete one left over from the days when startups were more
expensive.  A company that needed to build a factory or hire 50
people obviously needed to raise a certain minimum amount.  But few
technology startups are in that position today.<br><br>We advise startups to tell investors there are several different
routes they could take depending on how much they raised.  As little
as $50k could pay for food and rent for the founders for a year.
A couple hundred thousand would let them get office space and hire
some smart people they know from school.  A couple million would
let them really blow this thing out.  The message (and not just the
message, but the fact) should be: we're going to succeed no matter
what.  Raising more money just lets us do it faster.<br><br>If you're raising an angel round, the size of the round can even
change on the fly.  In fact, it's just as well to make the round
small initially, then expand as needed, rather than trying to raise
a large round and risk losing the investors you already have if you
can't raise the full amount.  You may even want to do a "rolling
close," where the round has no predetermined size, but instead you
sell stock to investors one at a time as they say yes.  That helps
break deadlocks, because you can start as soon as the first one
is ready to buy. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>5. Be independent.</b><br><br>A startup with a couple founders in their early twenties can have
expenses so low that they could be profitable on
as little as $2000 per month.  That's negligible as corporate
revenues go, but the effect on your morale and your bargaining
position is anything but.  At YC we use the phrase "ramen profitable"
to describe the situation where you're making just enough to pay
your living expenses.  Once you cross into ramen profitable,
everything changes.  You may still need investment to make it big,
but you don't need it this month.<br><br>You can't plan when you start a startup how long
it will take to become profitable.  But if you find yourself in a
position where a little more effort expended on sales would carry
you over the threshold of ramen profitable, do it.<br><br>Investors like it when you're ramen profitable.  It shows you've
thought about making money, instead of just working on amusing
technical problems; it shows you have the discipline to keep your
expenses low; but above all, it means you don't need them.<br><br>There is nothing investors like more than a startup that seems like
it's going to succeed even without them.  Investors like it when
they can help a startup, but they don't like startups that would
die without that help.<br><br>At YC we spend a lot of time trying to predict how the startups we've
funded will do, because we're trying to learn how to pick winners.
We've now watched the trajectories of so many startups that we're
getting better at predicting them.  And when we're talking
about startups we think are likely to succeed, what we find ourselves
saying is things like "Oh, those guys can take care of themselves.
They'll be fine." Not "those guys are really smart" or
"those guys are working on a great idea."
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font>
When we predict good outcomes for startups, the qualities
that come up in the supporting arguments are toughness, adaptability,
determination.  Which means to the extent we're correct, those are
the qualities you need to win.<br><br>Investors know this, at least unconsciously.   The reason they like
it when you don't need them is not simply that they like what they
can't have, but because that quality is what makes founders succeed.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhhId_WG7RA">Sam Altman</a> 
has it.  You could parachute him into an island full of
cannibals and come back in 5 years and he'd be the king.  If you're
Sam Altman, you don't have to be profitable to convey to investors
that you'll succeed with or without them.  (He wasn't, and he did.)
Not everyone has Sam's deal-making ability.  I myself don't.  But
if you don't, you can let the numbers speak for you.<br><br>
<b>6. Don't take rejection personally.</b><br><br>Getting rejected by investors can make you start to doubt yourself.
After all, they're more experienced than you.  If they think your
startup is lame, aren't they probably right?<br><br>Maybe, maybe not.  The way to handle rejection is with precision.
You shouldn't simply ignore rejection.  It might mean something.
But you shouldn't automatically get demoralized either.<br><br>To understand what rejection means, you have to understand first
of all how common it is.  Statistically, the average VC is a rejection
machine.  David Hornik, a partner at August, told me:
</p><blockquote>
  The numbers for me ended up being something like 500 to 800 plans
  received and read, somewhere between 50 and 100 initial 1 hour
  meetings held, about 20 companies that I got interested in, about
  5 that I got serious about and did a bunch of work, 1 to 2 deals
  done in a year.  So the odds are against you.  You
  may be a great entrepreneur, working on interesting stuff, etc.
  but it is still incredibly unlikely that you get funded.
</blockquote>
This is less true with angels, but VCs reject practically everyone.
The structure of their business means a partner does at most 2 new
investments a year, no matter how many good startups approach him.<br><br>In addition to the odds being terrible, the average investor is,
as I mentioned, a pretty bad judge of startups.  It's harder to
judge startups than most other things, because great startup ideas
tend to seem wrong. A good startup idea has to be not just good but
novel.  And to be both good and novel, an idea probably has to seem
bad to most people, or someone would already be doing it and it
wouldn't be novel.<br><br>That makes judging startups harder than most other things one judges.
You have to be an intellectual contrarian to be a good startup
investor.  That's a problem for VCs, most of whom are not particularly
imaginative.  VCs are mostly money guys, not people who make things.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
Angels are better at appreciating novel ideas, because most
were founders themselves.<br><br>So when you get a rejection, use the data that's in it, and not what's
not.  If an investor gives you specific reasons for not investing,
look at your startup and ask if they're right.  If they're real
problems, fix them.  But don't just take their word for it.  You're
supposed to be the domain expert; you have to decide.<br><br>Though a rejection doesn't necessarily tell you anything about your
startup, it does suggest your pitch could be improved.  Figure out
what's not working and change it.  Don't just think "investors are
stupid."  Often they are, but figure out precisely where you lose
them.<br><br>Don't let rejections pile up as a depressing, undifferentiated heap.
Sort them and analyze them, and then instead of thinking "no one
likes us," you'll know precisely how big a problem you have, and
what to do about it.<br><br>
<b>7. Be able to downshift into consulting (if appropriate).</b><br><br>Consulting, as I mentioned, is a dangerous way to finance a startup.
But it's better than dying.  It's a bit like anaerobic respiration:
not the optimum solution for the long term, but it can save you
from an immediate threat.  If you're having trouble raising money
from investors at all, it could save you to be able to shift
toward consulting.<br><br>This works better for some startups than others.  It wouldn't have
been a natural fit for, say, Google, but if your company was making
software for building web sites, you could degrade fairly gracefully
into consulting by building sites for clients with it.<br><br>So long as you were careful not to get sucked permanently into
consulting, this could even have advantages.  You'd understand your
users well if you were using the software for them.  Plus as a
consulting company you might be able to get big-name users using
your software that you wouldn't have gotten as a product company.<br><br>At Viaweb we were forced to operate like a consulting company
initially, because we were so desperate for users that we'd offer
to build merchants' sites for them if they'd sign up. 
But we never charged for such work, because we didn't want them to
start treating us like actual consultants, and calling us every
time they wanted something changed on their site.  We knew we had
to stay a product company, because only
that scales.<br><br>
<b>8. Avoid inexperienced investors.</b><br><br>Though novice investors seem unthreatening they can be the most
dangerous sort, because they're so nervous.  Especially in
proportion to the amount they invest.  Raising $20,000 from a first-time
angel investor can be as much work as raising $2 million from
a VC fund.<br><br>Their lawyers are generally inexperienced too.  But while the
investors can admit they don't know what they're doing, their lawyers
can't.  One YC startup negotiated terms for a tiny round with
an angel, only to receive a 70-page agreement from his lawyer.  And
since the lawyer could never admit, in front of his client, that
he'd screwed up, he instead had to insist on retaining all the
draconian terms in it, so the deal fell through.<br><br>Of course, someone has to take money from novice investors, or there
would never be any experienced ones.  But if you do, either (a)
drive the process yourself, including supplying the 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html">paperwork</a>, or
(b) use them only to fill up a larger round led by someone else.<br><br>
<b>9. Know where you stand.</b><br><br>The most dangerous thing about investors is their indecisiveness.
The worst case scenario is the long no, the no that comes after
months of meetings.  Rejections from investors are like design
flaws: inevitable, but much less costly if you discover them early.<br><br>So while you're talking to investors, constantly look for signs of
where you stand.  How likely are they to offer you a term sheet?
What do they have to be convinced of first?  You shouldn't necessarily
always be asking these questions outright—that could get 
annoying—but you should always be collecting data about them.<br><br>Investors tend to resist committing except to the extent you push
them to.  It's in their interest to collect the maximum amount of
information while making the minimum number of decisions.  The best
way to force them to act is, of course, competing investors.  But
you can also apply some force by focusing the discussion:
by asking what specific questions they need answered to make
up their minds, and then answering them.  If you get through several
obstacles and they keep raising new ones, assume that ultimately
they're going to flake.<br><br>You have to be disciplined when collecting data about investors'
intentions.  Otherwise their desire to lead you on will combine
with your own desire to be led on to produce completely inaccurate
impressions.<br><br>Use the data to weight your strategy.
You'll probably be talking to several investors.  Focus on the ones
that are most likely to say yes.  The value of a potential investor
is a combination of how good it would be if they said yes, and how
likely they are to say it.  Put the most weight on the second factor.
Partly because the most important quality in an investor is simply
investing.  But also because, as I mentioned, the biggest factor
in investors' opinion of you is other investors' opinion of you.
If you're talking to several investors and you manage to get one
over the threshold of saying yes, it will make the others much more
interested.  So you're not sacrificing the lukewarm investors if
you focus on the hot ones; convincing the hot investors is the best
way to convince the lukewarm ones.<br><br>
<b>Future</b><br><br>I'm hopeful things won't always be so awkward. I hope that as startups
get cheaper and the number of investors increases, raising money
will become, if not easy, at least straightforward.<br><br>In the meantime, the brokenness of the funding process offers a big
opportunity.  Most investors have no idea how dangerous they are.
They'd be surprised to hear that raising money from them is something
that has to be treated as a threat to a company's survival.  They
just think they need a little more information to make up their
minds.  They don't get that there are 10 other investors who also
want a little more information, and that the process of talking to
them all can bring a startup to a standstill for months.<br><br>Because investors don't understand the cost of dealing with them,
they don't realize how much room there is for a potential competitor
to undercut them.  I know from my own experience how much faster
investors could decide, because we've brought our own time down to
20 minutes (5 minutes of reading an application plus a 10 minute
interview plus 5 minutes of discussion).  If you were investing
more money you'd want to take longer, of course.  But if we can
decide in 20 minutes, should it take anyone longer than a couple
days?<br><br>Opportunities like this don't sit unexploited forever, even in an
industry as conservative as venture capital.  So
either existing investors will start to make up their minds faster,
or new investors will emerge who do.<br><br>In the meantime founders have to treat raising money as a dangerous
process.  Fortunately, I can fix the biggest danger right here.
The biggest danger is surprise.  It's that startups will underestimate
the difficulty of raising money—that they'll cruise through all
the initial steps, but when they turn to raising money they'll find
it surprisingly hard, get demoralized, and give up. So I'm telling
you in advance: raising money is hard.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
When investors can't make up their minds, they sometimes
describe it as if it were a property of the startup.  "You're too
early for us," they sometimes say.  But which of them, if they were
taken back in a time machine to the hour Google was founded, wouldn't
offer to invest at any valuation the founders chose?  An hour old
is not too early if it's the right startup.  What "you're too early"
really means is "we can't figure out yet whether you'll succeed."<br><br>
[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Investors influence one another both directly and indirectly.
They influence one another directly through the "buzz" that surrounds
a hot startup.  But they also influence one another indirectly
<i>through the founders.</i>  When a lot of investors are interested in
you, it increases your confidence in a way that makes you much more
attractive to investors.<br><br>No VC will admit they're influenced by buzz.  Some genuinely aren't.
But there are few who can say they're not influenced by confidence.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
One VC who read this essay wrote:<br><br>"We try to avoid companies that got bootstrapped with consulting. 
It creates very bad behaviors/instincts that are hard to erase 
from a company's culture."<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
The optimal way to answer the first question is to say that
it would be improper to name names, while simultaneously implying
that you're talking to a bunch of other VCs who are all about to
give you term sheets.  If you're the sort of person who understands
how to do that, go ahead.  If not, don't even try.  Nothing annoys
VCs more than clumsy efforts to manipulate them.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
The disadvantage of expanding a round on the fly is that the
valuation is fixed at the start, so if you get a sudden rush of
interest, you may have to decide between turning some investors
away and selling more of the company than you meant to.  That's a
good problem to have, however.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
I wouldn't say that intelligence doesn't matter in startups.
We're only comparing YC startups, who've already made it over a
certain threshold.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
But not all are.  Though most VCs are suits at heart,
the most successful ones tend not to be.  Oddly enough,
the best VCs tend to be the least VC-like.<br><br>
