<i>(This essay is from the introduction to </i><a href="onlisp.html">On Lisp</a><i>.)</i>
<!-- The red text explains the origins of <a href="arc.html">Arc</a>'s name.--><br><br>It's a long-standing principle of programming style that the functional
elements of a program should not be too large.  If some component of a
program grows beyond the stage where it's readily comprehensible,
it becomes a mass of complexity which conceals errors as easily
as a big city conceals fugitives.  Such software will be
hard to read, hard to test, and hard to debug.<br><br>In accordance with this principle, a large program must be divided
into pieces, and the larger the program, the more it must be divided.
How do you divide a program?  The traditional approach is
called <i>top-down design:</i> you say "the purpose of the
program is to do these seven things, so I divide it into seven major
subroutines.  The first subroutine has to do these four things, so
it in turn will have four of its own subroutines," and so on.
This process continues until the whole program has the right level
of granularity-- each part large enough to do something substantial,
but small enough to be understood as a single unit.<br><br>Experienced Lisp programmers divide up their programs differently.
As well as top-down design, they follow a principle which
could be called <i>bottom-up design</i>-- changing the language
to suit the problem.
In Lisp, you don't just write your program down toward the language,
you also build the language up toward your program.  As you're
writing a program you may think "I wish Lisp had such-and-such an
operator." So you go and write it. Afterward
you realize that using the new operator would simplify the design  
of another part of the program, and so on.
Language and program evolve together.
Like the border between two warring states,
the boundary between language and program is drawn and redrawn,
until eventually it comes to rest along the mountains and rivers,
the natural frontiers of your problem.
In the end your program will look as if the language had been
designed for it.
And when language and
program fit one another well, you end up with code which is
clear, small, and efficient.<br><br><xfont color="#880000">
It's worth emphasizing that bottom-up design doesn't mean
just writing the same program in a different order.  When you
work bottom-up, you usually end up with a different program.
Instead of a single, monolithic program,
you will get a larger language with more abstract operators,   
and a smaller program written in it.  Instead of a lintel,
you'll get an arch.
</xfont><br><br>In typical code, once you abstract out the parts which are
merely bookkeeping, what's left is much shorter;
the higher you build up the language, the less distance you
will have to travel from the top down to it.
This brings several advantages:<br><br></p><ol>
<li> By making the language do more of the work, bottom-up design
yields programs which are smaller and more agile.  A shorter
program doesn't have to be divided into so many components, and
fewer components means programs which are easier to read or
modify.  Fewer components also means fewer connections between   
components, and thus less chance for errors there.  As
industrial designers strive to reduce the number of moving parts
in a machine, experienced Lisp programmers use bottom-up design
to reduce the size and complexity of their programs.<br><br></li><li> Bottom-up design promotes code re-use.
When you write two
or more programs, many of the utilities you wrote for the first
program will also be useful in the succeeding ones.  Once you've  
acquired a large substrate of utilities, writing a new program can
take only a fraction of the effort it would require if you had to 
start with raw Lisp.<br><br></li><li> Bottom-up design makes programs easier to read.
<!--
%It yields the same result as top-down design
%with foresight---the foresight to arrange the branches near the
%root of the tree so that among the leaves there is as little
%duplication of effort as possible.
-->
An instance of this type
of abstraction asks the reader to understand a general-purpose operator;
an instance of functional abstraction asks the reader to understand
a special-purpose subroutine. [1]<br><br></li><li> Because it causes you always to be on the lookout for patterns
in your code, working bottom-up helps to clarify your ideas about
the design of your program.  If two distant components of a program
are similar in form, you'll be led to notice the similarity and
perhaps to redesign the program in a simpler way.
</li></ol>
<p align="justif">
Bottom-up design is possible to a certain degree in languages
other than Lisp.  Whenever you see library functions,
bottom-up design is happening.  However, Lisp gives you much broader
powers in this department, and augmenting the language plays a
proportionately larger role in Lisp style-- so much so that
Lisp is not just a different language, but a whole different way
of programming.<br><br>It's true that this style of development is better suited to
programs which can be written by small groups.  However, at the
same time, it extends the limits of what can be done by a small
group.  In <i>The Mythical Man-Month</i>,
Frederick Brooks
proposed that the productivity of a group of programmers
does not grow linearly with its size.  As the size of the
group increases, the productivity of individual programmers
goes down.  The experience of Lisp programming  
suggests a more cheerful way
to phrase this law: as the size of the group decreases, the
productivity of individual programmers goes up.
A small group wins, relatively speaking, simply because it's
smaller.  When a small group also takes advantage of the
techniques that Lisp makes possible, it can 
<a href="avg.html">win outright</a>.<br><br><br><br><b>New:</b> <a href="onlisptext.html">Download On Lisp for Free</a>.<br><br><br><br></p><br><br>

the program without understanding all your new utilities."

April 2001, rev. April 2003<br><br><i>(This article is derived from a talk given at the 2001 Franz
Developer Symposium.)
</i><br><br>In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I
started a startup called 
<a href="http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release184.html">Viaweb</a>.  
Our plan was to write
software that would let end users build online stores.
What was novel about this software, at the time, was
that it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages
as the interface.<br><br>A lot of people could have been having this idea at the
same time, of course, but as far as I know, Viaweb was
the first Web-based application.  It seemed such
a novel idea to us that we named the company after it:
Viaweb, because our software worked via the Web,
instead of running on your desktop computer.<br><br>Another unusual thing about this software was that it
was written primarily in a programming language called
Lisp. It was one of the first big end-user
applications to be written in Lisp, which up till then
had been used mostly in universities and research labs. [1]<br><br><b>The Secret Weapon</b><br><br>Eric Raymond has written an essay called "How to Become a Hacker,"
and in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers what
languages they should learn.  He suggests starting with Python and
Java, because they are easy to learn.  The serious hacker will also
want to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for system
administration and cgi scripts.  Finally, the truly serious hacker
should consider learning Lisp:
</p><blockquote>
  Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience
  you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make
  you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you
  never actually use Lisp itself a lot.
</blockquote>
This is the same argument you tend to hear for learning Latin.  It
won't get you a job, except perhaps as a classics professor, but
it will improve your mind, and make you a better writer in languages
you do want to use, like English.<br><br>But wait a minute.  This metaphor doesn't stretch that far.  The
reason Latin won't get you a job is that no one speaks it.  If you
write in Latin, no one can understand you.  But Lisp is a computer
language, and computers speak whatever language you, the programmer,
tell them to.<br><br>So if Lisp makes you a better programmer, like he says, why wouldn't
you want to use it? If a painter were offered a brush that would
make him a better painter, it seems to me that he would want to
use it in all his paintings, wouldn't he? I'm not trying to make
fun of Eric Raymond here.  On the whole, his advice is good.  What
he says about Lisp is pretty much the conventional wisdom.  But
there is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom:  Lisp will
make you a better programmer, and yet you won't use it.<br><br>Why not?  Programming languages are just tools, after all.  If Lisp
really does yield better programs, you should use it.  And if it
doesn't, then who needs it?<br><br>This is not just a theoretical question.  Software is a very
competitive business, prone to natural monopolies.  A company that
gets software written faster and better will, all other things
being equal, put its competitors out of business.  And when you're
starting a startup, you feel this very keenly.  Startups tend to
be an all or nothing proposition.  You either get rich, or you get
nothing.  In a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology, your
competitors will crush you.<br><br>Robert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn't see any reason
not to trust our instincts and go with Lisp.  We knew that everyone
else was writing their software in C++ or Perl.  But we also knew
that that didn't mean anything.  If you chose technology that way,
you'd be running Windows.  When you choose technology, you have to
ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will
work the best.<br><br>This is especially true in a startup.  In a big company, you can
do what all the other big companies are doing.  But a startup can't
do what all the other startups do.  I don't think a lot of people
realize this, even in startups.<br><br>The average big company grows at about ten percent a year.  So if
you're running a big company and you do everything the way the
average big company does it, you can expect to do as well as the
average big company-- that is, to grow about ten percent a year.<br><br>The same thing will happen if you're running a startup, of course.
If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should
expect average performance.  The problem here is, average performance
means that you'll go out of business.  The survival rate for startups
is way less than fifty percent.  So if you're running a startup,
you had better be doing something odd.  If not, you're in trouble.<br><br>Back in 1995, we knew something that I don't think our competitors
understood, and few understand even now:  when you're writing
software that only has to run on your own servers, you can use
any language you want.  When you're writing desktop software,
there's a strong bias toward writing applications in the same
language as the operating system.  Ten years ago, writing applications
meant writing applications in C.  But with Web-based software,
especially when you have the source code of both the language and
the operating system, you can use whatever language you want.<br><br>This new freedom is a double-edged sword, however.  Now that you
can use any language, you have to think about which one to use.
Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that
their competitors do not.<br><br>If you can use any language, which do you use?  We chose Lisp.
For one thing, it was obvious that rapid development would be
important in this market.  We were all starting from scratch, so
a company that could get new features done before its competitors
would have a big advantage.  We knew Lisp was a really good language
for writing software quickly, and server-based applications magnify
the effect of rapid development, because you can release software
the minute it's done.<br><br>If other companies didn't want to use Lisp, so much the better.
It might give us a technological edge, and we needed all the help
we could get.  When we started Viaweb, we had no experience in
business.  We didn't know anything about marketing, or hiring
people, or raising money, or getting customers.  Neither of us had
ever even had what you would call a real job.  The only thing we
were good at was writing software.  We hoped that would save us.
Any advantage we could get in the software department, we would
take.<br><br>So you could say that using Lisp was an experiment.  Our hypothesis
was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we'd be able to get
features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things
in our software that they couldn't do.  And because Lisp was so
high-level, we wouldn't need a big development team, so our costs
would be lower.  If this were so, we could offer a better product
for less money, and still make a profit.  We would end up getting
all the users, and our competitors would get none, and eventually
go out of business.  That was what we hoped would happen, anyway.<br><br>What were the results of this experiment?  Somewhat surprisingly,
it worked.  We eventually had many competitors, on the order of
twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete
with ours.  We had a wysiwyg online store builder that ran on the
server and yet felt like a desktop application.  Our competitors
had cgi scripts.  And we were always far ahead of them in features.
Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce
features that we didn't have.  But with Lisp our development cycle
was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within
a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release.  By
the time journalists covering the press release got round to calling
us, we would have the new feature too.<br><br>It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of
secret weapon-- that we were decoding their Enigma traffic or
something.  In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was simpler
than they realized.  No one was leaking news of their features to
us.   We were just able to develop software faster than anyone
thought possible.<br><br>When I was about nine I happened to get hold of a copy of <i>The Day
of the Jackal,</i> by Frederick Forsyth.  The main character is an
assassin who is hired to kill the president of France.  The assassin
has to get past the police to get up to an apartment that overlooks
the president's route.  He walks right by them, dressed up as an
old man on crutches, and they never suspect him.<br><br>Our secret weapon was similar.  We wrote our software in a weird
AI language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses.  For years
it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way.  But now it
worked to our advantage.  In business, there is nothing more valuable
than a technical advantage your competitors don't understand.  In
business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force.<br><br>And so, I'm a little embarrassed to say, I never said anything
publicly about Lisp while we were working on Viaweb.  We never
mentioned it to the press, and if you searched for Lisp on our Web
site, all you'd find were the titles of two books in my bio.  This
was no accident.  A startup should give its competitors as little
information as possible.  If they didn't know what language our
software was written in, or didn't care, I wanted to keep it that
way.[2]<br><br>The people who understood our technology best were the customers.
They didn't care what language Viaweb was written in either, but
they noticed that it worked really well.  It let them build great
looking online stores literally in minutes.  And so, by word of
mouth mostly, we got more and more users.  By the end of 1996 we
had about 70 stores online.  At the end of 1997 we had 500.  Six
months later, when Yahoo bought us, we had 1070 users.  Today, as
Yahoo Store, this software continues to dominate its market.  It's
one of the more profitable pieces of Yahoo, and the stores built
with it are the foundation of Yahoo Shopping.  I left Yahoo in
1999, so I don't know exactly how many users they have now, but
the last I heard there were about 20,000.<br><br><!-- People sometimes ask me if Yahoo Store still uses Lisp.  Yes, all
the Lisp code is still there.  Yahoo has server-side software
written in all five of the languages Eric Raymond recommends to
hackers.

<b>The Blub Paradox</b><br><br>What's so great about Lisp?  And if Lisp is so great, why doesn't
everyone use it?  These sound like rhetorical questions, but actually
they have straightforward answers.  Lisp is so great not because
of some magic quality visible only to devotees, but because it is
simply the most powerful language available.  And the reason everyone
doesn't use it is that programming languages are not merely
technologies, but habits of mind as well, and nothing changes
slower.  Of course, both these answers need explaining.<br><br>I'll begin with a shockingly controversial statement:  programming
languages vary in power.<br><br>Few would dispute, at least, that high level languages are more
powerful than machine language.  Most programmers today would agree
that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language.
Instead, you should program in a high-level language, and have a
compiler translate it into machine language for you.  This idea is
even built into the hardware now: since the 1980s, instruction sets
have been designed for compilers rather than human programmers.<br><br>Everyone knows it's a mistake to write your whole program by hand
in machine language.  What's less often understood is that there
is a more general principle here: that if you have a choice of
several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake
to program in anything but the most powerful one. [3]<br><br>There are many exceptions to this rule.  If you're writing a program
that has to work very closely with a program written in a certain
language, it might be a good idea to write the new program in the
same language.  If you're writing a program that only has to do
something very simple, like number crunching or bit manipulation,
you may as well use a less abstract language, especially since it
may be slightly faster.  And if you're writing a short, throwaway
program, you may be better off just using whatever language has
the best library functions for the task.  But in general, for
application software, you want to be using the most powerful
(reasonably efficient) language you can get, and using anything
else is a mistake, of exactly the same kind, though possibly in a
lesser degree, as programming in machine language.<br><br>You can see that machine language is very low level.  But, at least
as a kind of social convention, high-level languages are often all
treated as equivalent.  They're not.  Technically the term "high-level
language" doesn't mean anything very definite.  There's no dividing
line with machine languages on one side and all the high-level
languages on the other.  Languages fall along a continuum [4] of
abstractness, from the most powerful all the way down to machine
languages, which themselves vary in power.<br><br>Consider Cobol.  Cobol is a high-level language, in the sense that
it gets compiled into machine language.  Would anyone seriously
argue that Cobol is equivalent in power to, say, Python?  It's
probably closer to machine language than Python.<br><br>Or how about Perl 4?  Between Perl 4 and Perl 5, lexical closures
got added to the language.  Most Perl hackers would agree that Perl
5 is more powerful than Perl 4.  But once you've admitted that,
you've admitted that one high level language can be more powerful
than another.  And it follows inexorably that, except in special
cases, you ought to use the most powerful you can get.<br><br>This idea is rarely followed to its conclusion, though.  After a
certain age, programmers rarely switch languages voluntarily.
Whatever language people happen to be used to, they tend to consider
just good enough.<br><br>Programmers get very attached to their favorite languages, and I
don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so to explain this point I'm
going to use a hypothetical language called Blub.  Blub falls right
in the middle of the abstractness continuum.  It is not the most
powerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine
language.<br><br>And in fact, our hypothetical Blub programmer wouldn't use either
of them.  Of course he wouldn't program in machine language.  That's
what compilers are for.  And as for Cobol, he doesn't know how
anyone can get anything done with it.  It doesn't even have x (Blub
feature of your choice).<br><br>As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the
power continuum, he knows he's looking down.  Languages less powerful
than Blub are obviously less powerful, because they're missing some
feature he's used to.  But when our hypothetical Blub programmer
looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn't
realize he's looking up.  What he sees are merely weird languages.
He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but
with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well.  Blub is good
enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.<br><br>When we switch to the point of view of a programmer using any of
the languages higher up the power continuum, however, we find that
he in turn looks down upon Blub.  How can you get anything done in
Blub? It doesn't even have y.<br><br>By induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the
differences in power between the various languages are those who
understand the most powerful one.  (This is probably what Eric
Raymond meant about Lisp making you a better programmer.) You can't
trust the opinions of the others, because of the Blub paradox:
they're satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because
it dictates the way they think about programs.<br><br>I know this from my own experience, as a high school kid writing
programs in Basic.  That language didn't even support recursion.
It's hard to imagine writing programs without using recursion, but
I didn't miss it at the time.  I thought in Basic.  And I was a
whiz at it.  Master of all I surveyed.<br><br>The five languages that Eric Raymond recommends to hackers fall at
various points on the power continuum.  Where they fall relative
to one another is a sensitive topic.  What I will say is that I
think Lisp is at the top.  And to support this claim I'll tell you
about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other
four languages.  How can you get anything done in them, I think,
without macros? [5]<br><br>Many languages have something called a macro.  But Lisp macros are
unique.  And believe it or not, what they do is related to the
parentheses.  The designers of Lisp didn't put all those parentheses
in the language just to be different.  To the Blub programmer, Lisp
code looks weird.  But those parentheses are there for a reason.
They are the outward evidence of a fundamental difference between
Lisp and other languages.<br><br>Lisp code is made out of Lisp data objects.  And not in the trivial
sense that the source files contain characters, and strings are
one of the data types supported by the language.  Lisp code, after
it's read by the parser, is made of data structures that you can
traverse.<br><br>If you understand how compilers work, what's really going on is
not so much that Lisp has a strange syntax as that Lisp has no
syntax.  You write programs in the parse trees that get generated
within the compiler when other languages are parsed.  But these
parse trees are fully accessible to your programs.  You can write
programs that manipulate them.  In Lisp, these programs are called
macros.  They are programs that write programs.<br><br>Programs that write programs?  When would you ever want to do that?
Not very often, if you think in Cobol.  All the time, if you think
in Lisp.  It would be convenient here if I could give an example
of a powerful macro, and say there! how about that?  But if I did,
it would just look like gibberish to someone who didn't know Lisp;
there isn't room here to explain everything you'd need to know to
understand what it meant.  In 
<a href="acl.html">Ansi Common Lisp</a> I tried to move
things along as fast as I could, and even so I didn't get to macros
until page 160.<br><br>But I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing.
The source code of the Viaweb editor was probably about 20-25%
macros.  Macros are harder to write than ordinary Lisp functions,
and it's considered to be bad style to use them when they're not
necessary.  So every macro in that code is there because it has to
be.  What that means is that at least 20-25% of the code in this
program is doing things that you can't easily do in any other
language.  However skeptical the Blub programmer might be about my
claims for the mysterious powers of Lisp, this ought to make him
curious.  We weren't writing this code for our own amusement.  We
were a tiny startup, programming as hard as we could in order to
put technical barriers between us and our competitors.<br><br>A suspicious person might begin to wonder if there was some
correlation here.  A big chunk of our code was doing things that
are very hard to do in other languages.  The resulting software
did things our competitors' software couldn't do.  Maybe there was
some kind of connection.  I encourage you to follow that thread.
There may be more to that old man hobbling along on his crutches
than meets the eye.<br><br><b>Aikido for Startups</b><br><br>But I don't expect to convince anyone 
(<a href="http://www.trollope.org/scheme.html">over 25</a>) 
to go out and learn
Lisp.  The purpose of this article is not to change anyone's mind,
but to reassure people already interested in using Lisp-- people
who know that Lisp is a powerful language, but worry because it
isn't widely used.  In a competitive situation, that's an advantage.
Lisp's power is multiplied by the fact that your competitors don't
get it.<br><br>If you think of using Lisp in a startup, you shouldn't worry that
it isn't widely understood.  You should hope that it stays that
way. And it's likely to.  It's the nature of programming languages
to make most people satisfied with whatever they currently use.
Computer hardware changes so much faster than personal habits that
programming practice is usually ten to twenty years behind the
processor.  At places like MIT they were writing programs in
high-level languages in the early 1960s, but many companies continued
to write code in machine language well into the 1980s.  I bet a
lot of people continued to write machine language until the processor,
like a bartender eager to close up and go home, finally kicked them
out by switching to a risc instruction set.<br><br>Ordinarily technology changes fast.  But programming languages are
different: programming languages are not just technology, but what
programmers think in.  They're half technology and half religion.[6]
And so the median language, meaning whatever language the median
programmer uses, moves as slow as an iceberg.  Garbage collection,
introduced by Lisp in about 1960, is now widely considered to be
a good thing.  Runtime typing, ditto, is growing in popularity.
Lexical closures, introduced by Lisp in the early 1970s, are now,
just barely, on the radar screen.  Macros, introduced by Lisp in the
mid 1960s, are still terra incognita.<br><br>Obviously, the median language has enormous momentum.  I'm not
proposing that you can fight this powerful force.  What I'm proposing
is exactly the opposite: that, like a practitioner of Aikido, you
can use it against your opponents.<br><br>If you work for a big company, this may not be easy.  You will have
a hard time convincing the pointy-haired boss to let you build
things in Lisp, when he has just read in the paper that some other
language is poised, like Ada was twenty years ago, to take over
the world.  But if you work for a startup that doesn't have
pointy-haired bosses yet, you can, like we did, turn the Blub
paradox to your advantage:  you can use technology that your
competitors, glued immovably to the median language, will never be
able to match.<br><br>If you ever do find yourself working for a startup, here's a handy
tip for evaluating competitors.  Read their job listings.  Everything
else on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent,
but the job listings have to be specific about what they want, or
they'll get the wrong candidates.<br><br>During the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions.
A new competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month
or so.  The first thing I would do, after checking to see if they
had a live online demo, was look at their job listings.  After a
couple years of this I could tell which companies to worry about
and which not to.  The more of an IT flavor the job descriptions
had, the less dangerous the company was.  The safest kind were the
ones that wanted Oracle experience.  You never had to worry about
those.  You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java
developers.  If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would
be a bit frightening-- that's starting to sound like a company
where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers.  If I
had ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers, I would have
been really worried.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] Viaweb at first had two parts: the editor, written in Lisp,
which people used to build their sites, and the ordering system,
written in C, which handled orders.  The first version was mostly
Lisp, because the ordering system was small.  Later we added two
more modules, an image generator written in C, and a back-office
manager written mostly in Perl.<br><br>In January 2003, Yahoo released a new version of the editor 
written in C++ and Perl.  It's hard to say whether the program is no
longer written in Lisp, though, because to translate this program
into C++ they literally had to write a Lisp interpreter: the source
files of all the page-generating templates are still, as far as I
know,  Lisp code.  (See <a href="quotes.html">Greenspun's Tenth Rule</a>.)<br><br>[2] Robert Morris says that I didn't need to be secretive, because
even if our competitors had known we were using Lisp, they wouldn't
have understood why:  "If they were that smart they'd already be
programming in Lisp."<br><br>[3] All languages are equally powerful in the sense of being Turing
equivalent, but that's not the sense of the word programmers care
about. (No one wants to program a Turing machine.)  The kind of
power programmers care about may not be formally definable, but
one way to explain it would be to say that it refers to features
you could only get in the less powerful language by writing an
interpreter for the more powerful language in it. If language A
has an operator for removing spaces from strings and language B
doesn't, that probably doesn't make A more powerful, because you
can probably write a subroutine to do it in B.  But if A supports,
say, recursion, and B doesn't, that's not likely to be something
you can fix by writing library functions.<br><br>[4] Note to nerds: or possibly a lattice, narrowing toward the top;
it's not the shape that matters here but the idea that there is at
least a partial order.<br><br>[5] It is a bit misleading to treat macros as a separate feature.
In practice their usefulness is greatly enhanced by other Lisp
features like lexical closures and rest parameters.<br><br>[6] As a result, comparisons of programming languages either take
the form of religious wars or undergraduate textbooks so determinedly
neutral that they're really works of anthropology.  People who
value their peace, or want tenure, avoid the topic.  But the question
is only half a religious one; there is something there worth
studying, especially if you want to design new languages.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img

several other programmers about why Java smelled suspicious.  It's not
a critique of Java!  It is a case study of hacker's radar.<br><br>Over time, hackers develop a nose for good (and bad) technology.
I thought it might be interesting to try and write down what
made Java seem suspect to me.<br><br>Some people who've read this think it's an interesting attempt to write about
something that hasn't been written about before.  Others say I
will get in trouble for appearing to be writing about
things I don't understand.  So, just in
case it does any good, let me clarify that I'm not writing here
about Java (which I have never used) but about hacker's radar
(which I have thought about a lot).<br><br><br><br>The aphorism "you can't tell a book by its cover" originated in
the times when books were sold in plain cardboard covers, to be
bound by each purchaser according to his own taste.  In those days,
you couldn't tell a book by its cover.  But publishing has advanced
since then: present-day publishers work hard to make the cover
something you can tell a book by.<br><br>I spend a lot of time in bookshops and I feel as if I have by now
learned to understand everything publishers mean to tell me about
a book, and perhaps a bit more.  The time I haven't spent in
bookshops I've spent mostly in front of computers, and I feel as
if I've learned, to some degree, to judge technology by its cover
as well.  It may be just luck, but I've saved myself from a few
technologies that turned out to be real stinkers.<br><br>So far, Java seems like a stinker to me.  I've never written a Java
program, never more than glanced over reference books about it,
but I have a hunch that it won't be a very successful language.
I may turn out to be mistaken; making predictions about technology
is a dangerous business.  But for what it's worth, as a sort of
time capsule, here's why I don't like the look of Java:<br><br>
1. It has been so energetically hyped.  Real standards don't have
to be promoted.  No one had to promote C, or Unix, or HTML.  A real
standard tends to be already established by the time most people
hear about it.  On the hacker radar screen, Perl is as big as Java,
or bigger, just on the strength of its own merits.<br><br>2. It's aimed low.  In the original Java white paper, Gosling
explicitly says Java was designed not to be too difficult for
programmers used to C.  It was designed to be another C++: C plus
a few ideas taken from more advanced languages.  Like the creators
of sitcoms or junk food or package tours, Java's designers were
consciously designing a product for people not as smart as them.
Historically, languages designed for other people to use have been
bad:  Cobol, PL/I, Pascal, Ada, C++.  The good languages have been
those that were designed for their own creators:  C, Perl, Smalltalk,
Lisp.<br><br>3. It has ulterior motives.  Someone once said that the world would
be a better place if people only wrote books because they had
something to say, rather than because they wanted to write a book.
Likewise, the reason we hear about Java all the time is not because
it has something to say about programming languages.  We hear about
Java as part of a plan by Sun to undermine Microsoft.<br><br>4. No one loves it.  C, Perl, Python, Smalltalk, and Lisp programmers
love their languages.  I've never heard anyone say that they loved
Java.<br><br>5. People are forced to use it.  A lot of the people I know using
Java are using it because they feel they have to.  Either it's
something they felt they had to do to get funded, or something they
thought customers would want, or something they were told to do by
management.  These are smart people; if the technology was good,
they'd have used it voluntarily.<br><br>6. It has too many cooks.  The best programming languages have been
developed by small groups.  Java seems to be run by a committee.
If it turns out to be a good language, it will be the first time
in history that a committee has designed a good language.<br><br>7. It's bureaucratic.  From what little I know about Java, there
seem to be a lot of protocols for doing things.  Really good
languages aren't like that.  They let you do what you want and get
out of the way.<br><br>8. It's pseudo-hip.  Sun now pretends that Java is a grassroots,
open-source language effort like Perl or Python.  This one just
happens to be controlled by a giant company.  So the language is
likely to have the same drab clunkiness as anything else that comes
out of a big company.<br><br>9. It's designed for large organizations.  Large organizations have
different aims from hackers. They want languages that are (believed
to be) suitable for use by large teams of mediocre programmers--
languages with features that, like the speed limiters in U-Haul
trucks, prevent fools from doing too much damage.  Hackers don't
like a language that talks down to them.  Hackers just want power.
Historically, languages designed for large organizations (PL/I,
Ada) have lost, while hacker languages (C, Perl) have won.  The
reason: today's teenage hacker is tomorrow's CTO.<br><br>10. The wrong people like it.  The programmers I admire most are
not, on the whole, captivated by Java.  Who does like Java?  Suits,
who don't know one language from another, but know that they keep
hearing about Java in the press; programmers at big companies, who
are amazed to find that there is something even better than C++;
and plug-and-chug undergrads, who are ready to like anything that
might get them a job (will this be on the test?).  These people's
opinions change with every wind.<br><br>11. Its daddy is in a pinch.  Sun's business model is being undermined
on two fronts.  Cheap Intel processors, of the same type used in
desktop machines, are now more than fast enough for servers.  And
FreeBSD seems to be at least as good an OS for servers as Solaris.
Sun's advertising implies that you need Sun servers for industrial
strength applications.  If this were true, Yahoo would be first in
line to buy Suns;  but when I worked there, the servers were all
Intel boxes running FreeBSD.  This bodes ill for Sun's future.  If
Sun runs into trouble, they could drag Java down with them.<br><br>12. The DoD likes it.  The Defense Department is encouraging
developers to use Java. This seems to me the most damning sign of
all.  The Defense Department does a fine (though expensive) job of
defending the country, but they love plans and procedures and
protocols.  Their culture is the opposite of hacker culture; on
questions of software they will tend to bet wrong.  The last time
the DoD really liked a programming language, it was Ada.<br><br>
Bear in mind, this is not a critique of Java, but a critique of
its cover.  I don't know Java well enough to like it or dislike
it.  This is just an explanation of why I don't find that I'm eager
to learn it.<br><br>It may seem cavalier to dismiss a language before you've even tried
writing programs in it.  But this is something all programmers have
to do.  There are too many technologies out there to learn them
all.  You have to learn to judge by outward signs which will be
worth your time.  I have likewise cavalierly dismissed Cobol, Ada,
Visual Basic, the IBM AS400, VRML, ISO 9000, the SET protocol, VMS,
Novell Netware, and CORBA, among others.  They just smelled wrong.<br><br>It could be that in Java's case I'm mistaken.  It could be that a
language promoted by one big company to undermine another, designed
by a committee for a "mainstream" audience, hyped to the skies,
and beloved of the DoD, happens nonetheless to be a clean, beautiful,
powerful language that I would love programming in.  It could be,
but it seems very unlikely.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="trevrejavcov.html">Trevor Re: Java's Cover</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="bljava.html">Berners-Lee Re: Java</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="popular.html">Being Popular</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.archub.org/javamemo.txt">Sun Internal Memo</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2005/tc20051213_042973.htm">2005: BusinessWeek Agrees</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/lionfan/20070211">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

So it is missing (because it takes for granted) the most important
feature of a good programming language: very powerful abstractions.)</i><br><br>A friend of mine once told an eminent operating systems
expert that he wanted to design a really good
programming language.  The expert told him that it would be a
waste of time, that programming languages don't become popular
or unpopular based on their merits, and so no matter how
good his language was, no one would use it.  At least, that
was what had happened to the language <i>he</i> had designed.<br><br>What does make a language popular?  Do popular
languages deserve their popularity?  Is it worth trying to
define a good programming language?  How would you do it?<br><br>I think the answers to these questions can be found by looking 
at hackers, and learning what they want.  Programming
languages are <i>for</i> hackers, and a programming language
is good as a programming language (rather than, say, an
exercise in denotational semantics or compiler design)
if and only if hackers like it.<br><br><b>1 The Mechanics of Popularity</b><br><br>It's true, certainly, that most people don't choose programming
languages simply based on their merits.  Most programmers are told
what language to use by someone else.  And yet I think the effect
of such external factors on the popularity of programming languages
is not as great as it's sometimes thought to be. I think a bigger
problem is that a hacker's idea of a good programming language is
not the same as most language designers'.<br><br>Between the two, the hacker's opinion is the one that matters.
Programming languages are not theorems. They're tools, designed
for people, and they have to be designed to suit human strengths
and weaknesses as much as shoes have to be designed for human feet.
If a shoe pinches when you put it on, it's a bad shoe, however
elegant it may be as a piece of sculpture.<br><br>It may be that the majority of programmers can't tell a good language
from a bad one. But that's no different with any other tool. It
doesn't mean that it's a waste of time to try designing a good
language. <a href="design.html">Expert hackers</a> 
can tell a good language when they see
one, and they'll use it. Expert hackers are a tiny minority,
admittedly, but that tiny minority write all the good software,
and their influence is such that the rest of the programmers will
tend to use whatever language they use. Often, indeed, it is not
merely influence but command: often the expert hackers are the very
people who, as their bosses or faculty advisors, tell the other
programmers what language to use.<br><br>The opinion of expert hackers is not the only force that determines
the relative popularity of programming languages — legacy software
(Cobol) and hype (Ada, Java) also play a role — but I think it is
the most powerful force over the long term. Given an initial critical
mass and enough time, a programming language probably becomes about
as popular as it deserves to be. And popularity further separates
good languages from bad ones, because feedback from real live users
always leads to improvements. Look at how much any popular language
has changed during its life. Perl and Fortran are extreme cases,
but even Lisp has changed a lot. Lisp 1.5 didn't have macros, for
example; these evolved later, after hackers at MIT had spent a
couple years using Lisp to write real programs. [1]<br><br>So whether or not a language has to be good to be popular, I think
a language has to be popular to be good. And it has to stay popular
to stay good. The state of the art in programming languages doesn't
stand still. And yet the Lisps we have today are still pretty much
what they had at MIT in the mid-1980s, because that's the last time
Lisp had a sufficiently large and demanding user base.<br><br>Of course, hackers have to know about a language before they can
use it. How are they to hear? From other hackers. But there has to
be some initial group of hackers using the language for others even
to hear about it. I wonder how large this group has to be; how many
users make a critical mass? Off the top of my head, I'd say twenty.
If a language had twenty separate users, meaning twenty users who
decided on their own to use it, I'd consider it to be real.<br><br>Getting there can't be easy. I would not be surprised if it is
harder to get from zero to twenty than from twenty to a thousand.
The best way to get those initial twenty users is probably to use
a trojan horse: to give people an application they want, which
happens to be written in the new language.<br><br><b>2 External Factors</b><br><br>Let's start by acknowledging one external factor that does affect
the popularity of a programming language. To become popular, a
programming language has to be the scripting language of a popular
system. Fortran and Cobol were the scripting languages of early
IBM mainframes. C was the scripting language of Unix, and so, later,
was Perl. Tcl is the scripting language of Tk. Java and Javascript
are intended to be the scripting languages of web browsers.<br><br>Lisp is not a massively popular language because it is not the
scripting language of a massively popular system. What popularity
it retains dates back to the 1960s and 1970s, when it was the
scripting language of MIT. A lot of the great programmers of the
day were associated with MIT at some point. And in the early 1970s,
before C, MIT's dialect of Lisp, called MacLisp, was one of the
only programming languages a serious hacker would want to use.<br><br>Today Lisp is the scripting language of two moderately popular
systems, Emacs and Autocad, and for that reason I suspect that most
of the Lisp programming done today is done in Emacs Lisp or AutoLisp.<br><br>Programming languages don't exist in isolation. To hack is a
transitive verb — hackers are usually hacking something — and in
practice languages are judged relative to whatever they're used to
hack. So if you want to design a popular language, you either have
to supply more than a language, or you have to design your language
to replace the scripting language of some existing system.<br><br>Common Lisp is unpopular partly because it's an orphan. It did
originally come with a system to hack: the Lisp Machine. But Lisp
Machines (along with parallel computers) were steamrollered by the
increasing power of general purpose processors in the 1980s. Common
Lisp might have remained popular if it had been a good scripting
language for Unix. It is, alas, an atrociously bad one.<br><br>One way to describe this situation is to say that a language isn't
judged on its own merits. Another view is that a programming language
really isn't a programming language unless it's also the scripting
language of something. This only seems unfair if it comes as a
surprise. I think it's no more unfair than expecting a programming
language to have, say, an implementation. It's just part of what
a programming language is.<br><br>A programming language does need a good implementation, of course,
and this must be free. Companies will pay for software, but individual
hackers won't, and it's the hackers you need to attract.<br><br>A language also needs to have a book about it. The book should be
thin, well-written, and full of good examples. K&amp;R is the ideal
here. At the moment I'd almost say that a language has to have a
book published by O'Reilly. That's becoming the test of mattering
to hackers.<br><br>There should be online documentation as well. In fact, the book
can start as online documentation. But I don't think that physical
books are outmoded yet. Their format is convenient, and the de
facto censorship imposed by publishers is a useful if imperfect
filter. Bookstores are one of the most important places for learning
about new languages.<br><br><b>3 Brevity</b><br><br>Given that you can supply the three things any language needs — a
free implementation, a book, and something to hack — how do you
make a language that hackers will like?<br><br>One thing hackers like is brevity. Hackers are lazy, in the same
way that mathematicians and modernist architects are lazy: they
hate anything extraneous. It would not be far from the truth to
say that a hacker about to write a program decides what language
to use, at least subconsciously, based on the total number of
characters he'll have to type. If this isn't precisely how hackers
think, a language designer would do well to act as if it were.<br><br>It is a mistake to try to baby the user with long-winded expressions
that are meant to resemble English. Cobol is notorious for this
flaw. A hacker would consider being asked to write<br><br>add x to y giving z<br><br>instead of<br><br>z = x+y<br><br>as something between an insult to his intelligence and a sin against
God.<br><br>It has sometimes been said that Lisp should use first and rest
instead of car and cdr, because it would make programs easier to
read. Maybe for the first couple hours. But a hacker can learn
quickly enough that car means the first element of a list and cdr
means the rest. Using first and rest means 50% more typing. And
they are also different lengths, meaning that the arguments won't
line up when they're called, as car and cdr often are, in successive
lines. I've found that it matters a lot how code lines up on the
page. I can barely read Lisp code when it is set in a variable-width
font, and friends say this is true for other languages too.<br><br>Brevity is one place where strongly typed languages lose. All other
things being equal, no one wants to begin a program with a bunch
of declarations. Anything that can be implicit, should be.<br><br>The individual tokens should be short as well. Perl and Common Lisp
occupy opposite poles on this question. Perl programs can be almost
cryptically dense, while the names of built-in Common Lisp operators
are comically long. The designers of Common Lisp probably expected
users to have text editors that would type these long names for
them. But the cost of a long name is not just the cost of typing
it. There is also the cost of reading it, and the cost of the space
it takes up on your screen.<br><br><b>4 Hackability</b><br><br>There is one thing more important than brevity to a hacker: being
able to do what you want. In the history of programming languages
a surprising amount of effort has gone into preventing programmers
from doing things considered to be improper. This is a dangerously
presumptuous plan. How can the language designer know what the
programmer is going to need to do? I think language designers would
do better to consider their target user to be a genius who will
need to do things they never anticipated, rather than a bumbler
who needs to be protected from himself. The bumbler will shoot
himself in the foot anyway. You may save him from referring to
variables in another package, but you can't save him from writing
a badly designed program to solve the wrong problem, and taking
forever to do it.<br><br>Good programmers often want to do dangerous and unsavory things.
By unsavory I mean things that go behind whatever semantic facade
the language is trying to present: getting hold of the internal
representation of some high-level abstraction, for example. Hackers
like to hack, and hacking means getting inside things and second
guessing the original designer.<br><br><i>Let yourself be second guessed.</i> When you make any tool, people use
it in ways you didn't intend, and this is especially true of a
highly articulated tool like a programming language. Many a hacker
will want to tweak your semantic model in a way that you never
imagined. I say, let them; give the programmer access to as much
internal stuff as you can without endangering runtime systems like
the garbage collector.<br><br>In Common Lisp I have often wanted to iterate through the fields
of a struct — to comb out references to a deleted object, for example,
or find fields that are uninitialized. I know the structs are just
vectors underneath. And yet I can't write a general purpose function
that I can call on any struct. I can only access the fields by
name, because that's what a struct is supposed to mean.<br><br>A hacker may only want to subvert the intended model of things once
or twice in a big program. But what a difference it makes to be
able to. And it may be more than a question of just solving a
problem. There is a kind of pleasure here too. Hackers share the
surgeon's secret pleasure in poking about in gross innards, the
teenager's secret pleasure in popping zits. [2] For boys, at least,
certain kinds of horrors are fascinating. Maxim magazine publishes
an annual volume of photographs, containing a mix of pin-ups and
grisly accidents. They know their audience.<br><br>Historically, Lisp has been good at letting hackers have their way.
The political correctness of Common Lisp is an aberration. Early
Lisps let you get your hands on everything. A good deal of that
spirit is, fortunately, preserved in macros. What a wonderful thing,
to be able to make arbitrary transformations on the source code.<br><br>Classic macros are a real hacker's tool — simple, powerful, and
dangerous. It's so easy to understand what they do: you call a
function on the macro's arguments, and whatever it returns gets
inserted in place of the macro call. Hygienic macros embody the
opposite principle. They try to protect you from understanding what
they're doing. I have never heard hygienic macros explained in one
sentence. And they are a classic example of the dangers of deciding
what programmers are allowed to want. Hygienic macros are intended
to protect me from variable capture, among other things, but variable
capture is exactly what I want in some macros.<br><br>A really good language should be both clean and dirty: cleanly
designed, with a small core of well understood and highly orthogonal
operators, but dirty in the sense that it lets hackers have their
way with it. C is like this. So were the early Lisps. A real hacker's
language will always have a slightly raffish character.<br><br>A good programming language should have features that make the kind
of people who use the phrase "software engineering" shake their
heads disapprovingly. At the other end of the continuum are languages
like Ada and Pascal, models of propriety that are good for teaching
and not much else.<br><br><b>5 Throwaway Programs</b><br><br>To be attractive to hackers, a language must be good for writing
the kinds of programs they want to write. And that means, perhaps
surprisingly, that it has to be good for writing throwaway programs.<br><br>A throwaway program is a program you write quickly for some limited
task: a program to automate some system administration task, or
generate test data for a simulation, or convert data from one format
to another. The surprising thing about throwaway programs is that,
like the "temporary" buildings built at so many American universities
during World War II, they often don't get thrown away. Many evolve
into real programs, with real features and real users.<br><br>I have a hunch that the best big programs begin life this way,
rather than being designed big from the start, like the Hoover Dam.
It's terrifying to build something big from scratch. When people
take on a project that's too big, they become overwhelmed. The
project either gets bogged down, or the result is sterile and
wooden: a shopping mall rather than a real downtown, Brasilia rather
than Rome, Ada rather than C.<br><br>Another way to get a big program is to start with a throwaway
program and keep improving it. This approach is less daunting, and
the design of the program benefits from evolution. I think, if one
looked, that this would turn out to be the way most big programs
were developed. And those that did evolve this way are probably
still written in whatever language they were first written in,
because it's rare for a program to be ported, except for political
reasons. And so, paradoxically, if you want to make a language that
is used for big systems, you have to make it good for writing
throwaway programs, because that's where big systems come from.<br><br>Perl is a striking example of this idea. It was not only designed
for writing throwaway programs, but was pretty much a throwaway
program itself. Perl began life as a collection of utilities for
generating reports, and only evolved into a programming language
as the throwaway programs people wrote in it grew larger. It was
not until Perl 5 (if then) that the language was suitable for
writing serious programs, and yet it was already massively popular.<br><br>What makes a language good for throwaway programs? To start with,
it must be readily available. A throwaway program is something that
you expect to write in an hour. So the language probably must
already be installed on the computer you're using. It can't be
something you have to install before you use it. It has to be there.
C was there because it came with the operating system. Perl was
there because it was originally a tool for system administrators,
and yours had already installed it.<br><br>Being available means more than being installed, though. An
interactive language, with a command-line interface, is more
available than one that you have to compile and run separately. A
popular programming language should be interactive, and start up
fast.<br><br>Another thing you want in a throwaway program is brevity. Brevity
is always attractive to hackers, and never more so than in a program
they expect to turn out in an hour.<br><br><b>6 Libraries</b><br><br>Of course the ultimate in brevity is to have the program already
written for you, and merely to call it. And this brings us to what
I think will be an increasingly important feature of programming
languages: library functions. Perl wins because it has large
libraries for manipulating strings. This class of library functions
are especially important for throwaway programs, which are often
originally written for converting or extracting data.  Many Perl
programs probably begin as just a couple library calls stuck
together.<br><br>I think a lot of the advances that happen in programming languages
in the next fifty years will have to do with library functions. I
think future programming languages will have libraries that are as
carefully designed as the core language. Programming language design
will not be about whether to make your language strongly or weakly
typed, or object oriented, or functional, or whatever, but about
how to design great libraries. The kind of language designers who
like to think about how to design type systems may shudder at this.
It's almost like writing applications! Too bad. Languages are for
programmers, and libraries are what programmers need.<br><br>It's hard to design good libraries. It's not simply a matter of
writing a lot of code. Once the libraries get too big, it can
sometimes take longer to find the function you need than to write
the code yourself. Libraries need to be designed using a small set
of orthogonal operators, just like the core language. It ought to
be possible for the programmer to guess what library call will do
what he needs.<br><br>Libraries are one place Common Lisp falls short. There are only
rudimentary libraries for manipulating strings, and almost none
for talking to the operating system. For historical reasons, Common
Lisp tries to pretend that the OS doesn't exist. And because you
can't talk to the OS, you're unlikely to be able to write a serious
program using only the built-in operators in Common Lisp. You have
to use some implementation-specific hacks as well, and in practice
these tend not to give you everything you want. Hackers would think
a lot more highly of Lisp if Common Lisp had powerful string
libraries and good OS support.<br><br><b>7 Syntax</b><br><br>Could a language with Lisp's syntax, or more precisely, lack of
syntax, ever become popular? I don't know the answer to this
question. I do think that syntax is not the main reason Lisp isn't
currently popular. Common Lisp has worse problems than unfamiliar
syntax. I know several programmers who are comfortable with prefix
syntax and yet use Perl by default, because it has powerful string
libraries and can talk to the os.<br><br>There are two possible problems with prefix notation: that it is
unfamiliar to programmers, and that it is not dense enough. The
conventional wisdom in the Lisp world is that the first problem is
the real one. I'm not so sure. Yes, prefix notation makes ordinary
programmers panic. But I don't think ordinary programmers' opinions
matter. Languages become popular or unpopular based on what expert
hackers think of them, and I think expert hackers might be able to
deal with prefix notation. Perl syntax can be pretty incomprehensible,
but that has not stood in the way of Perl's popularity. If anything
it may have helped foster a Perl cult.<br><br>A more serious problem is the diffuseness of prefix notation. For
expert hackers, that really is a problem. No one wants to write
(aref a x y) when they could write a[x,y].<br><br>In this particular case there is a way to finesse our way out of
the problem. If we treat data structures as if they were functions
on indexes, we could write (a x y) instead, which is even shorter
than the Perl form. Similar tricks may shorten other types of
expressions.<br><br>We can get rid of (or make optional) a lot of parentheses by making
indentation significant. That's how programmers read code anyway:
when indentation says one thing and delimiters say another, we go
by the indentation. Treating indentation as significant would
eliminate this common source of bugs as well as making programs
shorter.<br><br>Sometimes infix syntax is easier to read. This is especially true
for math expressions. I've used Lisp my whole programming life and
I still don't find prefix math expressions natural. And yet it is
convenient, especially when you're generating code, to have operators
that take any number of arguments. So if we do have infix syntax,
it should probably be implemented as some kind of read-macro.<br><br>I don't think we should be religiously opposed to introducing syntax
into Lisp, as long as it translates in a well-understood way into
underlying s-expressions. There is already a good deal of syntax
in Lisp. It's not necessarily bad to introduce more, as long as no
one is forced to use it. In Common Lisp, some delimiters are reserved
for the language, suggesting that at least some of the designers
intended to have more syntax in the future.<br><br>One of the most egregiously unlispy pieces of syntax in Common Lisp
occurs in format strings; format is a language in its own right,
and that language is not Lisp. If there were a plan for introducing
more syntax into Lisp, format specifiers might be able to be included
in it. It would be a good thing if macros could generate format
specifiers the way they generate any other kind of code.<br><br>An eminent Lisp hacker told me that his copy of CLTL falls open to
the section format. Mine too. This probably indicates room for
improvement. It may also mean that programs do a lot of I/O.<br><br><b>8 Efficiency</b><br><br>A good language, as everyone knows, should generate fast code. But
in practice I don't think fast code comes primarily from things
you do in the design of the language. As Knuth pointed out long
ago, speed only matters in certain critical bottlenecks.  And as
many programmers have observed since, one is very often mistaken
about where these bottlenecks are.<br><br>So, in practice, the way to get fast code is to have a very good
profiler, rather than by, say, making the language strongly typed.
You don't need to know the type of every argument in every call in
the program. You do need to be able to declare the types of arguments
in the bottlenecks. And even more, you need to be able to find out
where the bottlenecks are.<br><br>One complaint people have had with Lisp is that it's hard to tell
what's expensive. This might be true. It might also be inevitable,
if you want to have a very abstract language. And in any case I
think good profiling would go a long way toward fixing the problem:
you'd soon learn what was expensive.<br><br>Part of the problem here is social. Language designers like to
write fast compilers. That's how they measure their skill. They
think of the profiler as an add-on, at best. But in practice a good
profiler may do more to improve the speed of actual programs written
in the language than a compiler that generates fast code. Here,
again, language designers are somewhat out of touch with their
users. They do a really good job of solving slightly the wrong
problem.<br><br>It might be a good idea to have an active profiler — to push
performance data to the programmer instead of waiting for him to
come asking for it. For example, the editor could display bottlenecks
in red when the programmer edits the source code. Another approach
would be to somehow represent what's happening in running programs.
This would be an especially big win in server-based applications,
where you have lots of running programs to look at. An active
profiler could show graphically what's happening in memory as a
program's running, or even make sounds that tell what's happening.<br><br>Sound is a good cue to problems. In one place I worked, we had a
big board of dials showing what was happening to our web servers.
The hands were moved by little servomotors that made a slight noise
when they turned. I couldn't see the board from my desk, but I
found that I could tell immediately, by the sound, when there was
a problem with a server.<br><br>It might even be possible to write a profiler that would automatically
detect inefficient algorithms. I would not be surprised if certain
patterns of memory access turned out to be sure signs of bad
algorithms. If there were a little guy running around inside the
computer executing our programs, he would probably have as long
and plaintive a tale to tell about his job as a federal government
employee. I often have a feeling that I'm sending the processor on
a lot of wild goose chases, but I've never had a good way to look
at what it's doing.<br><br>A number of Lisps now compile into byte code, which is then executed
by an interpreter. This is usually done to make the implementation
easier to port, but it could be a useful language feature. It might
be a good idea to make the byte code an official part of the
language, and to allow programmers to use inline byte code in
bottlenecks. Then such optimizations would be portable too.<br><br>The nature of speed, as perceived by the end-user, may be changing.
With the rise of server-based applications, more and more programs
may turn out to be i/o-bound. It will be worth making i/o fast.
The language can help with straightforward measures like simple,
fast, formatted output functions, and also with deep structural
changes like caching and persistent objects.<br><br>Users are interested in response time. But another kind of efficiency
will be increasingly important: the number of simultaneous users
you can support per processor. Many of the interesting applications
written in the near future will be server-based, and the number of
users per server is the critical question for anyone hosting such
applications. In the capital cost of a business offering a server-based
application, this is the divisor.<br><br>For years, efficiency hasn't mattered much in most end-user
applications. Developers have been able to assume that each user
would have an increasingly powerful processor sitting on their
desk. And by Parkinson's Law, software has expanded to use the
resources available. That will change with server-based applications.
In that world, the hardware and software will be supplied together.
For companies that offer server-based applications, it will make
a very big difference to the bottom line how many users they can
support per server.<br><br>In some applications, the processor will be the limiting factor,
and execution speed will be the most important thing to optimize.
But often memory will be the limit; the number of simultaneous
users will be determined by the amount of memory you need for each
user's data. The language can help here too. Good support for
threads will enable all the users to share a single heap. It may
also help to have persistent objects and/or language level support
for lazy loading.<br><br><b>9 Time</b><br><br>The last ingredient a popular language needs is time. No one wants
to write programs in a language that might go away, as so many
programming languages do. So most hackers will tend to wait until
a language has been around for a couple years before even considering
using it.<br><br>Inventors of wonderful new things are often surprised to discover
this, but you need time to get any message through to people. A
friend of mine rarely does anything the first time someone asks
him. He knows that people sometimes ask for things that they turn
out not to want. To avoid wasting his time, he waits till the third
or fourth time he's asked to do something; by then, whoever's asking
him may be fairly annoyed, but at least they probably really do
want whatever they're asking for.<br><br>Most people have learned to do a similar sort of filtering on new
things they hear about. They don't even start paying attention
until they've heard about something ten times. They're perfectly
justified: the majority of hot new whatevers do turn out to be a
waste of time, and eventually go away. By delaying learning VRML,
I avoided having to learn it at all.<br><br>So anyone who invents something new has to expect to keep repeating
their message for years before people will start to get it. We
wrote what was, as far as I know, the first web-server based
application, and it took us years to get it through to people that
it didn't have to be downloaded. It wasn't that they were stupid.
They just had us tuned out.<br><br>The good news is, simple repetition solves the problem. All you
have to do is keep telling your story, and eventually people will
start to hear. It's not when people notice you're there that they
pay attention; it's when they notice you're still there.<br><br>It's just as well that it usually takes a while to gain momentum.
Most technologies evolve a good deal even after they're first
launched — programming languages especially. Nothing could be better,
for a new techology, than a few years of being used only by a small
number of early adopters. Early adopters are sophisticated and
demanding, and quickly flush out whatever flaws remain in your
technology. When you only have a few users you can be in close
contact with all of them. And early adopters are forgiving when
you improve your system, even if this causes some breakage.<br><br>There are two ways new technology gets introduced: the organic
growth method, and the big bang method. The organic growth method
is exemplified by the classic seat-of-the-pants underfunded garage
startup. A couple guys, working in obscurity, develop some new
technology. They launch it with no marketing and initially have
only a few (fanatically devoted) users. They continue to improve
the technology, and meanwhile their user base grows by word of
mouth. Before they know it, they're big.<br><br>The other approach, the big bang method, is exemplified by the
VC-backed, heavily marketed startup. They rush to develop a product,
launch it with great publicity, and immediately (they hope) have
a large user base.<br><br>Generally, the garage guys envy the big bang guys. The big bang
guys are smooth and confident and respected by the VCs. They can
afford the best of everything, and the PR campaign surrounding the
launch has the side effect of making them celebrities. The organic
growth guys, sitting in their garage, feel poor and unloved. And
yet I think they are often mistaken to feel sorry for themselves.
Organic growth seems to yield better technology and richer founders
than the big bang method. If you look at the dominant technologies
today, you'll find that most of them grew organically.<br><br>This pattern doesn't only apply to companies. You see it in sponsored
research too. Multics and Common Lisp were big-bang projects, and
Unix and MacLisp were organic growth projects.<br><br><b>10 Redesign</b><br><br>"The best writing is rewriting," wrote E. B. White.  Every good
writer knows this, and it's true for software too. The most important
part of design is redesign. Programming languages, especially,
don't get redesigned enough.<br><br>To write good software you must simultaneously keep two opposing
ideas in your head. You need the young hacker's naive faith in
his abilities, and at the same time the veteran's skepticism. You
have to be able to think 
<a href="http://www.trevorblackwell.com">how hard can it be?</a> with one half of
your brain while thinking 
<a href="http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/~rtm/">it will never work</a> with the other.<br><br>The trick is to realize that there's no real contradiction here.
You want to be optimistic and skeptical about two different things.
You have to be optimistic about the possibility of solving the
problem, but skeptical about the value of whatever solution you've
got so far.<br><br>People who do good work often think that whatever they're working
on is no good. Others see what they've done and are full of wonder,
but the creator is full of worry. This pattern is no coincidence:
it is the worry that made the work good.<br><br>If you can keep hope and worry balanced, they will drive a project
forward the same way your two legs drive a bicycle forward. In the
first phase of the two-cycle innovation engine, you work furiously
on some problem, inspired by your confidence that you'll be able
to solve it. In the second phase, you look at what you've done in
the cold light of morning, and see all its flaws very clearly. But
as long as your critical spirit doesn't outweigh your hope, you'll
be able to look at your admittedly incomplete system, and think,
how hard can it be to get the rest of the way?, thereby continuing
the cycle.<br><br>It's tricky to keep the two forces balanced. In young hackers,
optimism predominates. They produce something, are convinced it's
great, and never improve it. In old hackers, skepticism predominates,
and they won't even dare to take on ambitious projects.<br><br>Anything you can do to keep the redesign cycle going is good. Prose
can be rewritten over and over until you're happy with it. But
software, as a rule, doesn't get redesigned enough. Prose has
readers, but software has <i>users.</i> If a writer rewrites an essay,
people who read the old version are unlikely to complain that their
thoughts have been broken by some newly introduced incompatibility.<br><br>Users are a double-edged sword. They can help you improve your
language, but they can also deter you from improving it. So choose
your users carefully, and be slow to grow their number. Having
users is like optimization: the wise course is to delay it. Also,
as a general rule, you can at any given time get away with changing
more than you think. Introducing change is like pulling off a
bandage: the pain is a memory almost as soon as you feel it.<br><br>Everyone knows that it's not a good idea to have a language designed
by a committee. Committees yield bad design. But I think the worst
danger of committees is that they interfere with redesign. It is
so much work to introduce changes that no one wants to bother.
Whatever a committee decides tends to stay that way, even if most
of the members don't like it.<br><br>Even a committee of two gets in the way of redesign. This happens
particularly in the interfaces between pieces of software written
by two different people. To change the interface both have to agree
to change it at once. And so interfaces tend not to change at all,
which is a problem because they tend to be one of the most ad hoc
parts of any system.<br><br>One solution here might be to design systems so that interfaces
are horizontal instead of vertical — so that modules are always
vertically stacked strata of abstraction. Then the interface will
tend to be owned by one of them. The lower of two levels will either
be a language in which the upper is written, in which case the
lower level will own the interface, or it will be a slave, in which
case the interface can be dictated by the upper level.<br><br><b>11 Lisp</b><br><br>What all this implies is that there is hope for a new Lisp.  There
is hope for any language that gives hackers what they want, including
Lisp. I think we may have made a mistake in thinking that hackers
are turned off by Lisp's strangeness. This comforting illusion may
have prevented us from seeing the real problem with Lisp, or at
least Common Lisp, which is that it sucks for doing what hackers
want to do. A hacker's language needs powerful libraries and
something to hack. Common Lisp has neither. A hacker's language is
terse and hackable. Common Lisp is not.<br><br>The good news is, it's not Lisp that sucks, but Common Lisp. If we
can develop a new Lisp that is a real hacker's language, I think
hackers will use it. They will use whatever language does the job.
All we have to do is make sure this new Lisp does some important
job better than other languages.<br><br>History offers some encouragement. Over time, successive new
programming languages have taken more and more features from Lisp.
There is no longer much left to copy before the language you've
made is Lisp. The latest hot language, Python, is a watered-down
Lisp with infix syntax and no macros. A new Lisp would be a natural
step in this progression.<br><br>I sometimes think that it would be a good marketing trick to call
it an improved version of Python. That sounds hipper than Lisp. To
many people, Lisp is a slow AI language with a lot of parentheses.
Fritz Kunze's official biography carefully avoids mentioning the
L-word.  But my guess is that we shouldn't be afraid to call the
new Lisp Lisp. Lisp still has a lot of latent respect among the
very best hackers — the ones who took 6.001 and understood it, for
example. And those are the users you need to win.<br><br>In "How to Become a Hacker," Eric Raymond describes Lisp as something
like Latin or Greek — a language you should learn as an intellectual
exercise, even though you won't actually use it:
<blockquote>
  Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience
  you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make
  you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you
  never actually use Lisp itself a lot.
</blockquote>
If I didn't know Lisp, reading this would set me asking questions.
A language that would make me a better programmer, if it means
anything at all, means a language that would be better for programming.
And that is in fact the implication of what Eric is saying.<br><br>As long as that idea is still floating around, I think hackers will
be receptive enough to a new Lisp, even if it is called Lisp. But
this Lisp must be a hacker's language, like the classic Lisps of
the 1970s. It must be terse, simple, and hackable. And it must have
powerful libraries for doing what hackers want to do now.<br><br>In the matter of libraries I think there is room to beat languages
like Perl and Python at their own game. A lot of the new applications
that will need to be written in the coming years will be 
<a href="road.html">server-based
applications</a>. There's no reason a new Lisp shouldn't have string
libraries as good as Perl, and if this new Lisp also had powerful
libraries for server-based applications, it could be very popular.
Real hackers won't turn up their noses at a new tool that will let
them solve hard problems with a few library calls. Remember, hackers
are lazy.<br><br>It could be an even bigger win to have core language support for
server-based applications. For example, explicit support for programs
with multiple users, or data ownership at the level of type tags.<br><br>Server-based applications also give us the answer to the question
of what this new Lisp will be used to hack. It would not hurt to
make Lisp better as a scripting language for Unix. (It would be
hard to make it worse.) But I think there are areas where existing
languages would be easier to beat. I think it might be better to
follow the model of Tcl, and supply the Lisp together with a complete
system for supporting server-based applications. Lisp is a natural
fit for server-based applications. Lexical closures provide a way
to get the effect of subroutines when the ui is just a series of
web pages. S-expressions map nicely onto html, and macros are good
at generating it. There need to be better tools for writing
server-based applications, and there needs to be a new Lisp, and
the two would work very well together.<br><br><b>12 The Dream Language</b><br><br>By way of summary, let's try describing the hacker's dream language.
The dream language is 
<a href="taste.html">beautiful</a>, clean, and terse. It has an
interactive toplevel that starts up fast. You can write programs
to solve common problems with very little code.  Nearly all the
code in any program you write is code that's specific to your
application. Everything else has been done for you.<br><br>The syntax of the language is brief to a fault. You never have to
type an unnecessary character, or even to use the shift key much.<br><br>Using big abstractions you can write the first version of a program
very quickly. Later, when you want to optimize, there's a really
good profiler that tells you where to focus your attention. You
can make inner loops blindingly fast, even writing inline byte code
if you need to.<br><br>There are lots of good examples to learn from, and the language is
intuitive enough that you can learn how to use it from examples in
a couple minutes. You don't need to look in the manual much. The
manual is thin, and has few warnings and qualifications.<br><br>The language has a small core, and powerful, highly orthogonal
libraries that are as carefully designed as the core language. The
libraries all work well together; everything in the language fits
together like the parts in a fine camera. Nothing is deprecated,
or retained for compatibility. The source code of all the libraries
is readily available. It's easy to talk to the operating system
and to applications written in other languages.<br><br>The language is built in layers. The higher-level abstractions are
built in a very transparent way out of lower-level abstractions,
which you can get hold of if you want.<br><br>Nothing is hidden from you that doesn't absolutely have to be. The
language offers abstractions only as a way of saving you work,
rather than as a way of telling you what to do. In fact, the language
encourages you to be an equal participant in its design. You can
change everything about it, including even its syntax, and anything
you write has, as much as possible, the same status as what comes
predefined.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1]  Macros very close to the modern idea were proposed by Timothy
Hart in 1964, two years after Lisp 1.5 was released. What was
missing, initially, were ways to avoid variable capture and multiple
evaluation; Hart's examples are subject to both.<br><br>[2]  In <i>When the Air Hits Your Brain,</i> neurosurgeon Frank Vertosick
recounts a conversation in which his chief resident, Gary, talks
about the difference between surgeons and internists ("fleas"):
<blockquote>
  Gary and I ordered a large pizza and found an open booth. The
  chief lit a cigarette. "Look at those goddamn fleas, jabbering
  about some disease they'll see once in their lifetimes. That's
  the trouble with fleas, they only like the bizarre stuff. They
  hate their bread and butter cases. That's the difference between
  us and the fucking fleas. See, we love big juicy lumbar disc
  herniations, but they hate hypertension...."
</blockquote>
It's hard to think of a lumbar disc herniation as juicy (except
literally). And yet I think I know what they mean. I've often had
a juicy bug to track down. Someone who's not a programmer would
find it hard to imagine that there could be pleasure in a bug.
Surely it's better if everything just works. In one way, it is.
And yet there is undeniably a grim satisfaction in hunting down
certain sorts of bugs.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/bepop.ps?t=1688221954&amp;">Postscript Version</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html">Arc</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="langdes.html">Five Questions about Language Design</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">How to Become a Hacker</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.shiro.dreamhost.com/scheme/trans/being-popular-j.html">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

<p>
<i>(These are some notes I made
for a panel discussion on programming language design
at MIT on May 10, 2001.)</i><br><br><br><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7da73740e97ff14708a6c5d3a6fdfe86.gif" width="159" height="18" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br><br><b>1. Programming Languages Are for People.</b><br><br>Programming languages
are how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as
happy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we
have high level languages is because people can't deal with
machine language.  The point of programming
languages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being 
overwhelmed by a mass of detail.<br><br>Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal
than others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems
is designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning
a given distance with the least material.  The other end of the
spectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their
time thinking about human butts.<br><br>Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing
data through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like designing
bridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing
chairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.<br><br>Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great
mathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us
than pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical
elegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.
But elegance is not an end in itself.<br><br>And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,
I don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.
In fact I think you ought to design for the 
<a href="design.html">best programmers</a>, but
even the best programmers have limitations.  I don't think anyone
would like programming in a language where all the variables were
the letter x with integer subscripts.<br><br><b>2. Design for Yourself and Your Friends.</b><br><br>If you look at the history of programming languages, a lot of the best
ones were languages designed for their own authors to use, and a
lot of the worst ones were designed for other people to use.<br><br>When languages are designed for other people, it's always a specific
group of other people: people not as smart as the language designer.
So you get a language that talks down to you.  Cobol is the most
extreme case, but a lot of languages are pervaded by this spirit.<br><br>It has nothing to do with how abstract the language is.  C is pretty
low-level, but it was designed for its authors to use, and that's
why hackers like it.<br><br>The argument for designing languages for bad programmers is that
there are more bad programmers than good programmers.  That may be
so.  But those few good programmers write a disproportionately
large percentage of the software.<br><br>I'm interested in the question, how do you design a language that
the very best hackers will like?  I happen to think this is
identical to the question, how do you design a good programming
language?, but even if it isn't, it is at least an interesting
question.<br><br><b>3. Give the Programmer as Much Control as Possible.</b><br><br>Many languages
(especially the ones designed for other people) have the attitude
of a governess: they try to prevent you from
doing things that they think aren't good for you.  I like the   
opposite approach: give the programmer as much
control as you can.<br><br>When I first learned Lisp, what I liked most about it was
that it considered me an equal partner.  In the other languages
I had learned up till then, there was the language and there was my   
program, written in the language, and the two were very separate.
But in Lisp the functions and macros I wrote were just like those
that made up the language itself.  I could rewrite the language
if I wanted.  It had the same appeal as open-source software.<br><br><b>4. Aim for Brevity.</b><br><br>Brevity is underestimated and even scorned.
But if you look into the hearts of hackers, you'll see that they
really love it.  How many times have you heard hackers speak fondly
of how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple
lines of code?  I think anything that really smart people really
love is worth paying attention to.<br><br>I think almost anything
you can do to make programs shorter is good.  There should be lots
of library functions; anything that can be implicit should be;
the syntax should be terse to a fault; even the names of things
should be short.<br><br>And it's not only programs that should be short.  The manual should
be thin as well.  A good part of manuals is taken up with clarifications
and reservations and warnings and special cases.  If you force  
yourself to shorten the manual, in the best case you do it by fixing
the things in the language that required so much explanation.<br><br><b>5. Admit What Hacking Is.</b><br><br>A lot of people wish that hacking was
mathematics, or at least something like a natural science.  I think
hacking is more like architecture.  Architecture is
related to physics, in the sense that architects have to design
buildings that don't fall down, but the actual goal of architects
is to make great buildings, not to make discoveries about statics.<br><br>What hackers like to do is make great programs.
And I think, at least in our own minds, we have to remember that it's
an admirable thing to write great programs, even when this work 
doesn't translate easily into the conventional intellectual
currency of research papers.  Intellectually, it is just as
worthwhile to design a language programmers will love as it is to design a
horrible one that embodies some idea you can publish a paper
about.<br><br><br><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/5da78ed5604609d6f0c6d0c58bb617a6.gif" width="125" height="18" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br><br><b>1. How to Organize Big Libraries?</b><br><br>Libraries are becoming an
increasingly important component of programming languages.  They're
also getting bigger, and this can be dangerous.  If it takes longer
to find the library function that will do what you want than it
would take to write it yourself, then all that code is doing nothing
but make your manual thick.  (The Symbolics manuals were a case in 
point.)  So I think we will have to work on ways to organize
libraries.  The ideal would be to design them so that the programmer
could guess what library call would do the right thing.<br><br><b>2. Are People Really Scared of Prefix Syntax?</b><br><br>This is an open
problem in the sense that I have wondered about it for years and
still don't know the answer.  Prefix syntax seems perfectly natural
to me, except possibly for math.  But it could be that a lot of 
Lisp's unpopularity is simply due to having an unfamiliar syntax.   
Whether to do anything about it, if it is true, is another question. 
</p><p align="left">
<b>3. What Do You Need for Server-Based Software?</b>
</p></font><p align="justif"><font size="2" face="verdana">
I think a lot of the most exciting new applications that get written
in the next twenty years will be Web-based applications, meaning
programs that sit on the server and talk to you through a Web
browser.  And to write these kinds of programs we may need some
new things.<br><br>One thing we'll need is support for the new way that server-based 
apps get released.  Instead of having one or two big releases a
year, like desktop software, server-based apps get released as a
series of small changes.  You may have as many as five or ten
releases a day.  And as a rule everyone will always use the latest
version.<br><br>You know how you can design programs to be debuggable?
Well, server-based software likewise has to be designed to be
changeable.  You have to be able to change it easily, or at least
to know what is a small change and what is a momentous one.<br><br>Another thing that might turn out to be useful for server based
software, surprisingly, is continuations.  In Web-based software
you can use something like continuation-passing style to get the
effect of <a href="lwba.html">subroutines</a> in the inherently 
stateless world of a Web
session.  Maybe it would be worthwhile having actual continuations,
if it was not too expensive.<br><br><b>4. What New Abstractions Are Left to Discover?</b><br><br>I'm not sure how
reasonable a hope this is, but one thing I would really love to    
do, personally, is discover a new abstraction-- something that would
make as much of a difference as having first class functions or
recursion or even keyword parameters.  This may be an impossible
dream.  These things don't get discovered that often.  But I am always
looking.<br><br><br><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/2aa51492a05320c4e8d7cad464b73492.gif" width="179" height="18" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br><br><b>1. You Can Use Whatever Language You Want.</b><br><br>Writing application
programs used to mean writing desktop software.  And in desktop
software there is a big bias toward writing the application in the
same language as the operating system.  And so ten years ago,
writing software pretty much meant writing software in C.
Eventually a tradition evolved:
application programs must not be written in unusual languages.  
And this tradition had so long to develop that nontechnical people
like managers and venture capitalists also learned it.<br><br>Server-based software blows away this whole model.  With server-based
software you can use any language you want.  Almost nobody understands
this yet (especially not managers and venture capitalists).
A few hackers understand it, and that's why we even hear
about new, indy languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing
about Perl and Python because people are using them to write Windows
apps.<br><br>What this means for us, as people interested in designing programming
languages, is that there is now potentially an actual audience for
our work.<br><br><b>2. Speed Comes from Profilers.</b><br><br>Language designers, or at least
language implementors, like to write compilers that generate fast
code.  But I don't think this is what makes languages fast for users.
Knuth pointed out long ago that speed only matters in a few critical
bottlenecks.  And anyone who's tried it knows that you can't guess
where these bottlenecks are.  Profilers are the answer.<br><br>Language designers are solving the wrong problem.  Users don't need
benchmarks to run fast.  What they need is a language that can show
them what parts of their own programs need to be rewritten.  That's
where speed comes from in practice.  So maybe it would be a net 
win if language implementors took half the time they would
have spent doing compiler optimizations and spent it writing a
good profiler instead.<br><br><b>3. You Need an Application to Drive the Design of a Language.</b><br><br>This may not be an absolute rule, but it seems like the best languages
all evolved together with some application they were being used to
write.  C was written by people who needed it for systems programming.
Lisp was developed partly to do symbolic differentiation, and
McCarthy was so eager to get started that he was writing differentiation
programs even in the first paper on Lisp, in 1960.<br><br>It's especially good if your application solves some new problem.
That will tend to drive your language to have new features that   
programmers need.  I personally am interested in writing
a language that will be good for writing server-based applications.<br><br>[During the panel, Guy Steele also made this point, with the
additional suggestion that the application should not consist of
writing the compiler for your language, unless your language
happens to be intended for writing compilers.]<br><br><b>4. A Language Has to Be Good for Writing Throwaway Programs.</b><br><br>You know what a throwaway program is: something you write quickly for
some limited task.  I think if you looked around you'd find that  
a lot of big, serious programs started as throwaway programs.  I
would not be surprised if <i>most</i> programs started as throwaway
programs.  And so if you want to make a language that's good for
writing software in general, it has to be good for writing throwaway
programs, because that is the larval stage of most software.<br><br><b>5. Syntax Is Connected to Semantics.</b><br><br>It's traditional to think of
syntax and semantics as being completely separate.  This will
sound shocking, but it may be that they aren't.
I think that what you want in your language may be related
to how you express it.<br><br>I was talking recently to Robert Morris, and he pointed out that
operator overloading is a bigger win in languages with infix
syntax.  In a language with prefix syntax, any function you define
is effectively an operator.  If you want to define a plus for a
new type of number you've made up, you can just define a new function
to add them.  If you do that in a language with infix syntax,
there's a big difference in appearance between the use of an
overloaded operator and a function call.<br><br><br><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/b85fd0fb4b0d5daf508ad4cc915dda6a.gif" width="254" height="18" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br><br><b>1. New Programming Languages.</b><br><br>Back in the 1970s
it was fashionable to design new programming languages.  Recently
it hasn't been.  But I think server-based software will make new  
languages fashionable again.  With server-based software, you can
use any language you want, so if someone does design a language that
actually seems better than others that are available, there will be
people who take a risk and use it.<br><br><b>2. Time-Sharing.</b><br><br>Richard Kelsey gave this as an idea whose time
has come again in the last panel, and I completely agree with him.
My guess (and Microsoft's guess, it seems) is that much computing
will move from the desktop onto remote servers.  In other words,  
time-sharing is back.  And I think there will need to be support
for it at the language level.  For example, I know that Richard
and Jonathan Rees have done a lot of work implementing process  
scheduling within Scheme 48.<br><br><b>3. Efficiency.</b><br><br>Recently it was starting to seem that computers
were finally fast enough.  More and more we were starting to hear
about byte code, which implies to me at least that we feel we have
cycles to spare.  But I don't think we will, with server-based
software.   Someone is going to have to pay for the servers that
the software runs on, and the number of users they can support per
machine will be the divisor of their capital cost.<br><br>So I think efficiency will matter, at least in computational
bottlenecks.  It will be especially important to do i/o fast,
because server-based applications do a lot of i/o.<br><br>It may turn out that byte code is not a win, in the end.  Sun and
Microsoft seem to be facing off in a kind of a battle of the byte
codes at the moment.  But they're doing it because byte code is a
convenient place to insert themselves into the process, not because
byte code is in itself a good idea.  It may turn out that this
whole battleground gets bypassed.  That would be kind of amusing.<br><br><br><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/624d54d428f5bf9f633590dfb617758f.gif" width="170" height="18" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br><br><b>1. Clients.</b><br><br>This is just a guess, but my guess is that
the winning model for most applications will be purely server-based.
Designing software that works on the assumption that everyone will 
have your client is like designing a society on the assumption that
everyone will just be honest.  It would certainly be convenient, but
you have to assume it will never happen.<br><br>I think there will be a proliferation of devices that have some
kind of Web access, and all you'll be able to assume about them is
that they can support simple html and forms.  Will you have a
browser on your cell phone?  Will there be a phone in your palm  
pilot?  Will your blackberry get a bigger screen? Will you be able
to browse the Web on your gameboy?  Your watch?  I don't know.  
And I don't have to know if I bet on
everything just being on the server.  It's
just so much more robust to have all the 
<a href="road.html">brains on the server</a>.<br><br><b>2. Object-Oriented Programming.</b><br><br>I realize this is a
controversial one, but I don't think object-oriented programming
is such a big deal.  I think it is a fine model for certain kinds
of applications that need that specific kind of data structure,   
like window systems, simulations, and cad programs.  But I don't
see why it ought to be the model for all programming.<br><br>I think part of the reason people in big companies like object-oriented
programming is because it yields a lot of what looks like work.
Something that might naturally be represented as, say, a list of
integers, can now be represented as a class with all kinds of
scaffolding and hustle and bustle.<br><br>Another attraction of
object-oriented programming is that methods give you some of the
effect of first class functions.  But this is old news to Lisp
programmers.  When you have actual first class functions, you can
just use them in whatever way is appropriate to the task at hand,
instead of forcing everything into a mold of classes and methods.<br><br>What this means for language design, I think, is that you shouldn't
build object-oriented programming in too deeply.  Maybe the
answer is to offer more general, underlying stuff, and let people design
whatever object systems they want as libraries.<br><br><b>3. Design by Committee.</b><br><br>Having your language designed by a committee is a big pitfall,  
and not just for the reasons everyone knows about.  Everyone
knows that committees tend to yield lumpy, inconsistent designs.  
But I think a greater danger is that they won't take risks.
When one person is in charge he can take risks
that a committee would never agree on.<br><br>Is it necessary to take risks to design a good language though?
Many people might suspect
that language design is something where you should stick fairly
close to the conventional wisdom.  I bet this isn't true.
In everything else people do, reward is proportionate to risk.
Why should language design be any different?<br><br></font></p></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/lionfan/20070215">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

<i>(I wrote this article to help myself understand exactly
what McCarthy discovered.  You don't need to know this stuff
to program in Lisp, but it should be helpful to 
anyone who wants to
understand the essence of Lisp � both in the sense of its
origins and its semantic core.  The fact that it has such a core
is one of Lisp's distinguishing features, and the reason why,
unlike other languages, Lisp has dialects.)</i><br><br>In 1960, <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/index.html">John 
McCarthy</a> published a remarkable paper in
which he did for programming something like what Euclid did for
geometry. He showed how, given a handful of simple
operators and a notation for functions, you can
build a whole programming language.
He called this language Lisp, for "List Processing,"
because one of his key ideas was to use a simple
data structure called a <i>list</i> for both
code and data.<br><br>It's worth understanding what McCarthy discovered, not
just as a landmark in the history of computers, but as
a model for what programming is tending to become in
our own time.  It seems to me that there have been
two really clean, consistent models of programming so
far: the C model and the Lisp model.
These two seem points of high ground, with swampy lowlands
between them.  As computers have grown more powerful,
the new languages being developed have been <a href="diff.html">moving
steadily</a> toward the Lisp model.  A popular recipe
for new programming languages in the past 20 years 
has been to take the C model of computing and add to
it, piecemeal, parts taken from the Lisp model,
like runtime typing and garbage collection.<br><br>In this article I'm going to try to explain in the
simplest possible terms what McCarthy discovered.
The point is not just to learn about an interesting
theoretical result someone figured out forty years ago,
but to show where languages are heading.
The unusual thing about Lisp � in fact, the defining
quality of Lisp � is that it can be written in
itself.  To understand what McCarthy meant by this,
we're going to retrace his steps, with his mathematical
notation translated into running Common Lisp code.<br><br><br clear="all"></font></p></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img

(This article explains why much of the next generation of software
may be server-based, what that will mean for programmers,
and why this new kind of software is a great opportunity for startups.
It's derived from a talk at BBN Labs.)
</i><br><br>In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I decided to
start a startup.  The PR campaign leading up to Netscape's IPO was
running full blast then, and there was a lot of talk in the press
about online commerce.  At the time there might have been thirty
actual stores on the Web, all made by hand.  If there were going
to be a lot of online stores, there would need to be software for making
them, so we decided to write some.<br><br>For the first week or so we intended to make this an ordinary   
desktop application.  Then one day we had the idea of making the
software run on our Web server, using the browser as an
interface.  We tried rewriting the software to work over
the Web, and it was clear that this was the way to go.
If we wrote our software to run on the server, it would be a lot easier
for the users and for us as well.<br><br>This turned out to be a good plan.  Now, as 
<a href="http://store.yahoo.com">Yahoo Store</a>, this
software is the most popular online store builder, with
about 14,000 users.<br><br>When we started Viaweb, hardly anyone understood what we meant when
we said that the software ran on the server.  It was not until
Hotmail was launched a year later that people started to get it.
Now everyone knows that this is a valid approach.  There is
a name now for what we were: an Application Service Provider,
or ASP.<br><br>I think that a lot of the next generation of software will be
written on this model.  Even Microsoft, who have the most to
lose, seem to see the inevitablity of moving some things off
the desktop. If software moves
off the desktop and onto servers, it will mean a very different
world for developers.  This article describes the surprising
things we saw, as some of the first visitors to this new world.
To the extent software does move onto
servers, what I'm describing here is the future.<br><br><b>The Next Thing?</b><br><br>When we look back on the desktop software era, I think we'll marvel
at the inconveniences people put up with, just as we marvel now at
what early car owners put up with.  For the first twenty or thirty
years, you had to be a car expert to own a car.  But cars were such
a big win that lots of people who weren't car experts wanted to
have them as well.<br><br>Computers are in this phase now.  When you own a desktop computer,
you end up learning a lot more than you wanted to know about what's
happening inside it.  But more than half the households in the US
own one.  My mother has a computer that she uses for email and for
keeping accounts.  About a year ago she was alarmed to receive a
letter from Apple, offering her a discount on a new version of the
operating system.  There's something wrong when a sixty-five year
old woman who wants to use a computer for email and accounts has
to think about installing new operating systems.  Ordinary users
shouldn't even know the words "operating system," much less "device
driver" or "patch."<br><br>There is now another way to deliver software that will save users
from becoming system administrators.  Web-based applications are
programs that run on Web servers and use Web pages as the user
interface.  For the average user this new kind of software will be
easier, cheaper, more mobile, more reliable, and often more powerful
than desktop software.<br><br>With Web-based software, most users won't have to think about
anything except the applications they use.  All the messy, changing
stuff will be sitting on a server somewhere, maintained by the kind
of people who are good at that kind of thing.  And so you won't
ordinarily need a computer, per se, to use software.  All you'll
need will be something with a keyboard, a screen, and a Web browser.
Maybe it will have wireless Internet access.  Maybe it will also
be your cell phone.  Whatever it is, it will be consumer electronics:
something that costs about $200, and that people choose mostly
based on how the case looks.  You'll pay more for Internet services
than you do for the hardware, just as you do now with telephones. [1]<br><br>It will take about a tenth of a second for a click to get to the
server and back, so users of heavily interactive software, like
Photoshop, will still want to have the computations happening on
the desktop.  But if you look at the kind of things most people
use computers for, a tenth of a second latency would not be a
problem.  My mother doesn't really need a desktop computer, and
there are a lot of people like her.<br><br><b>The Win for Users</b><br><br>Near my house there is a car with a bumper sticker that reads "death
before inconvenience."  Most people, most of the time, will take
whatever choice requires least work.  If Web-based software wins,
it will be because it's more convenient.  And it looks as if it
will be, for users and developers both.<br><br>To use a purely Web-based application, all you need is a browser
connected to the Internet.  So you can use a Web-based application
anywhere.  When you install software on your desktop computer, you
can only use it on that computer.  Worse still, your files are
trapped on that computer.  The inconvenience of this model becomes
more and more evident as people get used to networks.<br><br>The thin end of the wedge here was Web-based email.  Millions of
people now realize that you should have access to email messages
no matter where you are.  And if you can see your email, why not
your calendar?  
If you can discuss a document with your colleagues,
why can't you edit it?  Why should any of your data be trapped on
some computer sitting on a faraway desk?<br><br>The whole idea of "your computer" is going away, and being replaced
with "your data."  You should be able to get at your data from any
computer.  Or rather, any client, and a client doesn't have to be
a computer.<br><br>Clients shouldn't store data; they should be like telephones.  In
fact they may become telephones, or vice versa.  And as clients
get smaller, you have another reason not to keep your data on them:
something you carry around with you can be lost or stolen.   Leaving
your PDA in a taxi is like a disk crash, except that your data is
handed to <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/business/0,39020645,2077931,00.htm">someone else</a> 
instead of being vaporized.<br><br>With purely Web-based software, neither your data nor the applications
are kept on the client.  So you don't have to install anything to
use it.  And when there's no installation, you don't have to worry
about installation going wrong.  There can't be incompatibilities
between the application and your operating system, because the
software doesn't run on your operating system.<br><br>Because it needs no installation, it will be easy, and common, to
try Web-based software before you "buy" it.  You should expect to
be able to test-drive any Web-based application for free, just by
going to the site where it's offered.  At Viaweb our whole site
was like a big arrow pointing users to the test drive.<br><br>After trying the demo, signing up for the service should require
nothing more than filling out a brief form (the briefer the better).
And that should be the last work the user has to do.  With Web-based
software, you should get new releases without paying extra, or
doing any work, or possibly even knowing about it.<br><br>Upgrades won't be the big shocks they are now.  Over time applications
will quietly grow more powerful.  This will take some effort on
the part of the developers.  They will have to design software so
that it can be updated without confusing the users.  That's a new
problem, but there are ways to solve it.<br><br>With Web-based applications, everyone uses the same version, and
bugs can be fixed as soon as they're discovered.  So Web-based
software should have far fewer bugs than desktop software.  At
Viaweb, I doubt we ever had ten known bugs at any one time.  That's
orders of magnitude better than desktop software.<br><br>Web-based applications can be used by several people at the same
time.  This is an obvious win for collaborative applications, but
I bet users will start to want this in most applications once they
realize it's possible.  It will often be useful to let two people
edit the same document, for example.  Viaweb let multiple users
edit a site simultaneously, more because that was the right way to
write the software than because we expected users to want to, but
it turned out that many did.<br><br>When you use a Web-based application, your data will be safer.
Disk crashes won't be a thing of the past, but users won't hear
about them anymore.  They'll happen within server farms.  And
companies offering Web-based applications will actually do backups--
not only because they'll have real system administrators worrying
about such things, but because an ASP that does lose people's data
will be in big, big trouble.  When people lose their own data in
a disk crash, they can't get that mad, because they only have
themselves to be mad at.  When a company loses their data for them,
they'll get a lot madder.<br><br>Finally, Web-based software should be less vulnerable to viruses.
If the client doesn't run anything except a browser, there's less
chance of running viruses, and no data locally to damage.  And a
program that attacked the servers themselves should find them very
well defended. [2]<br><br>For users, Web-based software will be <i>less stressful.</i>  I think if
you looked inside the average Windows user you'd find a huge and
pretty much untapped desire for software meeting that description.
Unleashed, it could be a powerful force.<br><br><b>City of Code</b><br><br>To developers, the most conspicuous difference between Web-based
and desktop software is that a Web-based application is not a single
piece of code.  It will be a collection of programs of different
types rather than a single big binary.  And so designing Web-based
software is like desiging a city rather than a building: as well
as buildings you need roads, street signs, utilities, police and
fire departments, and plans for both growth and various kinds of
disasters.<br><br>At Viaweb, software included fairly big applications that users
talked to directly, programs that those programs used, programs
that ran constantly in the background looking for problems, programs
that tried to restart things if they broke, programs that ran
occasionally to compile statistics or build indexes for searches,
programs we ran explicitly to garbage-collect resources or to move
or restore data, programs that pretended to be users (to measure
performance or expose bugs), programs for diagnosing network
troubles, programs for doing backups, interfaces to outside services,
software that drove an impressive collection of dials displaying
real-time server statistics (a hit with visitors, but indispensable
for us too), modifications (including bug fixes) to open-source
software, and a great many configuration files and settings.  Trevor
Blackwell wrote a spectacular program for moving stores to new
servers across the country, without shutting them down, after we
were bought by Yahoo. Programs paged us, sent faxes and email to
users, conducted transactions with credit card processors, and
talked to one another through sockets, pipes, http requests, ssh,
udp packets, shared memory, and files.  Some of Viaweb even consisted
of the absence of programs, since one of the keys to Unix security
is not to run unnecessary utilities that people might use to break
into your servers.<br><br>It did not end with software.  We spent a lot of time thinking
about server configurations.  We built the servers ourselves, from
components-- partly to save money, and partly to get exactly what
we wanted.  We had to think about whether our upstream ISP had fast
enough connections to all the backbones.  We serially  
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=6hdipo%243o0%241%40FreeBSD.csie.NCTU.edu.tw">dated</a>
RAID suppliers.<br><br>But hardware is not just something to worry about.  When you control
it you can do more for users.  With a desktop application, you can
specify certain minimum hardware, but you can't add more.  If you
administer the servers, you can in one step enable all your users
to page people, or send faxes, or send commands by phone, or process
credit cards, etc, just by installing the relevant hardware.  We
always looked for new ways to add features with hardware, not just
because it pleased users, but also as a way to distinguish ourselves
from competitors who (either because they sold desktop software,
or resold Web-based applications through ISPs) didn't have direct
control over the hardware.<br><br>Because the software in a Web-based application will be a collection
of programs rather than a single binary, it can be written in any
number of different languages.  When you're writing desktop software,
you're practically forced to write the application in the same
language as the underlying operating system-- meaning C and C++.
And so these languages (especially among nontechnical people like
managers and VCs) got to be considered as the languages for "serious"
software development.  But that was just an artifact of the way
desktop software had to be delivered.  For server-based software
you can use any language you want. [3]  Today a lot of the top
hackers are using languages far removed from C and C++:  Perl,
Python, and even Lisp.<br><br>With server-based software, no one can tell you what language to
use, because you control the whole system, right down to the
hardware.  Different languages are good for different tasks.  You
can use whichever is best for each.  And when you have competitors,
"you can" means "you must" (we'll return to this later), because
if you don't take advantage of this possibility, your competitors
will.<br><br>Most of our competitors used C and C++, and this made their software
visibly inferior because (among other things), they had no way
around the statelessness of CGI scripts.  If you were going to
change something, all the changes had to happen on one page, with
an Update button at the bottom.  As I've written elsewhere, by
using <a href="avg.html">Lisp</a>, which many people still consider 
a research language,
we could make the Viaweb editor behave more like desktop software.<br><br><b>Releases</b><br><br>One of the most important changes in this new world is the way you
do releases. In the desktop software business, doing a release is
a huge trauma, in which the whole company sweats and strains to
push out a single, giant piece of code.  Obvious comparisons suggest
themselves, both to the process and the resulting product.<br><br>With server-based software, you can make changes almost as you
would in a program you were writing for yourself.  You release
software as a series of incremental changes instead of an occasional
big explosion. A typical desktop software company might do one or
two releases a year.  At Viaweb we often did three to five releases
a day.<br><br>When you switch to this new model, you realize how much software
development is affected by the way it is released.  Many of the
nastiest problems you see in the desktop software business are due
to catastrophic nature of releases.<br><br>When you release only one new version a year, you tend to deal with
bugs wholesale.  Some time before the release date you assemble a
new version in which half the code has been torn out and replaced,
introducing countless bugs.  Then a squad of QA people step in and
start counting them, and the programmers work down the list, fixing
them.  They do not generally get to the end of the list, and indeed,
no one is sure where the end is.  It's like fishing rubble out of
a pond.  You never really know what's happening inside the software.
At best you end up with a statistical sort of correctness.<br><br>With server-based software, most of the change is small and
incremental.  That in itself is less likely to introduce bugs.  It
also means you know what to test most carefully when you're about
to release software: the last thing you changed.  You end up with
a much firmer grip on the code.  As a general rule, you do know
what's happening inside it.  You don't have the source code memorized,
of course, but when you read the source you do it like a pilot
scanning the instrument panel, not like a detective trying to
unravel some mystery.<br><br>Desktop software breeds a certain fatalism about bugs.  You know
that you're shipping something loaded with bugs, and you've even
set up mechanisms to compensate for it (e.g. patch releases).  So
why worry about a few more?  Soon you're releasing whole features
you know are broken.  
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1006-200-5195914.html">Apple</a> 
did this earlier this year.  They felt
under pressure to release their new OS, whose release date had
already slipped four times, but some of the software (support for
CDs and DVDs) wasn't ready. The solution?  They released the OS
without the unfinished parts, and users will have to install them
later.<br><br>With Web-based software, you never have to release software before
it works, and you can release it as soon as it does work.<br><br>The industry veteran may be thinking, it's a fine-sounding idea to
say that you never have to release software before it works, but
what happens when you've promised to deliver a new version of your
software by a certain date?  With Web-based software, you wouldn't
make such a promise, because there are no versions.  Your software
changes gradually and continuously.  Some changes might be bigger
than others, but the idea of versions just doesn't naturally fit
onto Web-based software.<br><br>If anyone remembers Viaweb this might sound odd, because we were
always announcing new versions.  This was done entirely for PR
purposes.  The trade press, we learned, thinks in version numbers.
They will give you major coverage for a major release, meaning a
new first digit on the version number, and generally a paragraph
at most for a point release, meaning a new digit after the decimal
point.<br><br>Some of our competitors were offering desktop software and actually
had version numbers.  And for these releases, the mere fact of
which seemed to us evidence of their backwardness, they would get
all kinds of publicity.  We didn't want to miss out, so we started
giving version numbers to our software too.  When we wanted some
publicity, we'd make a list of all the features we'd added since
the last "release," stick a new version number on the software,
and issue a press release saying that the new version was available
immediately.  Amazingly, no one ever called us on it.<br><br>By the time we were bought, we had done this three times, so we
were on Version 4.  Version 4.1 if I remember correctly.  After
Viaweb became Yahoo Store, there was no longer such a desperate
need for publicity, so although the software continued to evolve,
the whole idea of version numbers was quietly dropped.<br><br><b>Bugs</b><br><br>The other major technical advantage of Web-based software is that
you can reproduce most bugs.  You have the users' data right there
on your disk.  If someone breaks your software, you don't have to
try to guess what's going on, as you would with desktop software:
you should be able to reproduce the error while they're on the
phone with you.  You might even know about it already, if you have
code for noticing errors built into your application.<br><br>Web-based software gets used round the clock, so everything you do
is immediately put through the wringer.  Bugs turn up quickly.<br><br>Software companies are sometimes accused of letting the users debug
their software.  And that is just what I'm advocating.  For Web-based
software it's actually a good plan, because the bugs are fewer and
transient.  When you release software gradually you get far fewer
bugs to start with.  And when you can reproduce errors and release
changes instantly, you can find and fix most bugs as soon as they
appear.  We never had enough bugs at any one time to bother with
a formal bug-tracking system.<br><br>You should test changes before you release them, of course, so no
major bugs should get released.  Those few that inevitably slip
through will involve borderline cases and will only affect the few
users that encounter them before someone calls in to complain.  As
long as you fix bugs right away, the net effect, for the average
user, is far fewer bugs.  I doubt the average Viaweb user ever saw
a bug.<br><br>Fixing fresh bugs is easier than fixing old ones.  It's usually
fairly quick to find a bug in code you just wrote.  When it turns
up you often know what's wrong before you even look at the source,
because you were already worrying about it subconsciously. Fixing
a bug in something you wrote six months ago (the average case if
you release once a year) is a lot more work.  And since you don't
understand the code as well, you're more likely to fix it in an
ugly way, or even introduce more bugs. [4]<br><br>When you catch bugs early, you also get fewer compound bugs.
Compound bugs are two separate bugs that interact:  you trip going
downstairs, and when you reach for the handrail it comes off in
your hand.  In software this kind of bug is the hardest to find,
and also tends to have the worst consequences. [5]  The traditional
"break everything and then filter out the bugs" approach inherently
yields a lot of compound bugs.  And software that's released in a
series of small changes inherently tends not to. The floors are
constantly being swept clean of any loose objects that might later
get stuck in something.<br><br>It helps if you use a technique called functional programming.
Functional programming means avoiding side-effects.  It's something
you're more likely to see in research papers than commercial
software, but for Web-based applications it turns out to be really
useful.  It's hard to write entire programs as purely functional
code, but you can write substantial chunks this way.  It makes
those parts of your software easier to test, because they have no
state, and that is very convenient in a situation where you are
constantly making and testing small modifications.  I wrote much
of Viaweb's editor in this style, and we made our scripting language,
<a href="http://store.yahoo.com/rtml.html">RTML</a>, 
a purely functional language.<br><br>People from the desktop software business will find this hard to
credit, but at Viaweb bugs became almost a game.  Since most released
bugs involved borderline cases, the users who encountered them were
likely to be advanced users, pushing the envelope.  Advanced users
are more forgiving about bugs, especially since you probably
introduced them in the course of adding some feature they were
asking for.  In fact, because bugs were rare and you had to be
doing sophisticated things to see them, advanced users were often
proud to catch one.  They would call support in a spirit more of
triumph than anger, as if they had scored points off us.<br><br><b>Support</b><br><br>When you can reproduce errors, it changes your approach to customer
support.  At most software companies, support is offered as a way
to make customers feel better.  They're either calling you about
a known bug, or they're just doing something wrong and you have to
figure out what.  In either case there's not much you can learn
from them.  And so you tend to view support calls as a pain in the
ass that you want to isolate from your developers as much as
possible.<br><br>This was not how things worked at Viaweb.  At Viaweb, support was
free, because we wanted to hear from customers.  If someone had a
problem, we wanted to know about it right away so that we could
reproduce the error and release a fix.<br><br>So at Viaweb the developers were always in close contact with
support.  The customer support people were about thirty feet away
from the programmers, and knew that they could always interrupt
anything with a report of a genuine bug.  We would leave a board
meeting to fix a serious bug.<br><br>Our approach to support made everyone happier.  The customers were
delighted.  Just imagine how it would feel to call a support line
and be treated as someone bringing important news.  The customer
support people liked it because it meant they could help the users,
instead of reading scripts to them.  And the programmers liked it
because they could reproduce bugs instead of just hearing vague
second-hand reports about them.<br><br>Our policy of fixing bugs on the fly changed the relationship
between customer support people and hackers.  At most software
companies, support people are underpaid human shields, and hackers
are little copies of God the Father, creators of the world.  Whatever
the procedure for reporting bugs, it is likely to be one-directional:
support people who hear about bugs fill out some form that eventually
gets passed on (possibly via QA) to programmers, who put it on
their list of things to do.  It was very different at Viaweb.
Within a minute of hearing about a bug from a customer, the support
people could be standing next to a programmer hearing him say "Shit,
you're right, it's a bug." It delighted the support people to hear
that "you're right" from the hackers.  They used to bring us bugs
with the same expectant air as a cat bringing you a mouse it has
just killed.   It also made them more careful in judging the
seriousness of a bug, because now their honor was on the line.<br><br>After we were bought by Yahoo, the customer support people were
moved far away from the programmers.  It was only then that we
realized that they were effectively QA and to some extent marketing
as well.  In addition to catching bugs, they were the keepers of
the knowledge of vaguer, buglike things, like features that confused
users. [6]  They were also a kind of proxy focus group; we could
ask them which of two new features users wanted more, and they were
always right.<br><br><b>Morale</b><br><br>Being able to release software immediately is a big motivator.
Often as I was walking to work I would think of some change I wanted
to make to the software, and do it that day.  This worked for bigger
features as well.  Even if something was going to take two weeks
to write (few projects took longer), I knew I could see the effect
in the software as soon as it was done.<br><br>If I'd had to wait a year for the next release, I would have shelved
most of these ideas, for a while at least.  The thing about ideas,
though, is that they lead to more ideas.  Have you ever noticed
that when you sit down to write something, half the ideas that end
up in it are ones you thought of while writing it?  The same thing
happens with software.  Working to implement one idea gives you
more ideas.  So shelving an idea costs you not only that delay in
implementing it, but also all the ideas that implementing it would
have led to.  In fact, shelving an idea probably even inhibits new
ideas: as you start to think of some new feature, you catch sight
of the shelf and think "but I already have a lot of new things I
want to do for the next release."<br><br>What big companies do instead of implementing features is plan
them.  At Viaweb we sometimes ran into trouble on this account.
Investors and analysts would ask us what we had planned for the
future.  The truthful answer would have been, we didn't have any
plans.  We had general ideas about things we wanted to improve,
but if we knew how we would have done it already.  What were we
going to do in the next six months? Whatever looked like the biggest
win.  I don't know if I ever dared give this answer, but that was
the truth.  Plans are just another word for ideas on the shelf.
When we thought of good ideas, we implemented them.<br><br>At Viaweb, as at many software companies, most code had one definite
owner.  But when you owned something you really owned it: no one
except the owner of a piece of software had to approve (or even
know about) a release.  There was no protection against breakage
except the fear of looking like an idiot to one's peers, and that
was more than enough.  I may have given the impression that we just
blithely plowed forward writing code.  We did go fast, but we
thought very carefully before we released software onto those
servers.  And paying attention is more important to reliability
than moving slowly.  Because he pays close attention, a Navy pilot
can land a 40,000 lb. aircraft at 140 miles per hour on a pitching
carrier deck, at night, more safely than the average teenager can
cut a bagel.<br><br>This way of writing software is a double-edged sword of course.
It works a lot better for a small team of good, trusted programmers
than it would for a big company of mediocre ones, where bad ideas
are caught by committees instead of the people that had them.<br><br><b>Brooks in Reverse</b><br><br>Fortunately, Web-based software does require fewer programmers.
I once worked for a medium-sized desktop software company that had
over 100 people working in engineering as a whole.  Only 13 of
these were in product development.  All the rest were working on
releases, ports, and so on.  With Web-based software, all you need
(at most) are the 13 people, because there are no releases, ports,
and so on.<br><br>Viaweb was written by just three people. [7]  I was always under
pressure to hire more, because we wanted to get bought, and we knew
that buyers would have a hard time paying a high price for a company
with only three programmers.  (Solution:  we hired more, but created
new projects for them.)<br><br>When you can write software with fewer programmers, it saves you
more than money.  As Fred Brooks pointed out in <i>The Mythical
Man-Month,</i> adding people to a project tends to slow it down.  The
number of possible connections between developers grows exponentially
with the size of the group.  The larger the group, the more time
they'll spend in meetings negotiating how their software will work
together, and the more bugs they'll get from unforeseen interactions.
Fortunately, this process also works in reverse: as groups get
smaller, software development gets exponentially more efficient.
I can't remember the programmers at Viaweb ever having an actual
meeting.  We never had more to say at any one time than we could
say as we were walking to lunch.<br><br>If there is a downside here, it is that all the programmers have
to be to some degree system administrators as well.  When you're
hosting software, someone has to be watching the servers, and in
practice the only people who can do this properly are the ones who
wrote the software.  At Viaweb our system had so many components
and changed so frequently that there was no definite border between
software and infrastructure.  Arbitrarily declaring such a border
would have constrained our design choices.  And so although we were
constantly hoping that one day ("in a couple months") everything
would be stable enough that we could hire someone whose job was
just to worry about the servers, it never happened.<br><br>I don't think it could be any other way, as long as you're still
actively developing the product.  Web-based software is never going
to be something you write, check in, and go home.  It's a live
thing, running on your servers right now.  A bad bug might not just
crash one user's process; it could crash them all.  If a bug in
your code corrupts some data on disk, you have to fix it.  And so
on.  We found that you don't have to watch the servers every minute
(after the first year or so), but you definitely want to keep an
eye on things you've changed recently.  You don't release code late
at night and then go home.<br><br><b>Watching Users</b><br><br>With server-based software, you're in closer touch with your code.
You can also be in closer touch with your users.  Intuit is famous
for introducing themselves to customers at retail stores and asking
to follow them home.  If you've ever watched someone use your
software for the first time, you know what surprises must have
awaited them.<br><br>Software should do what users think it will.  But you can't have
any idea what users will be thinking, believe me, until you watch
them.  And server-based software gives you unprecedented information
about their behavior.  You're not limited to small, artificial
focus groups.  You can see every click made by every user.  You
have to consider carefully what you're going to look at, because
you don't want to violate users' privacy, but even the most general
statistical sampling can be very useful.<br><br>When you have the users on your server, you don't have to rely on
benchmarks, for example.  Benchmarks are simulated users.  With
server-based software, you can watch actual users.  To decide what
to optimize, just log into a server and see what's consuming all
the CPU.  And you know when to stop optimizing too: we eventually
got the Viaweb editor to the point where it was memory-bound rather
than CPU-bound, and since there was nothing we could do to decrease
the size of users' data (well, nothing easy), we knew we might as
well stop there.<br><br>Efficiency matters for server-based software, because you're paying
for the hardware.  The number of users you can support per server
is the divisor of your capital cost, so if you can make your software
very efficient you can undersell competitors and still make a
profit.  At Viaweb we got the capital cost per user down to about
$5.  It would be less now, probably less than the cost of sending
them the first month's bill.  Hardware is free now, if your software
is reasonably efficient.<br><br>Watching users can guide you in design as well as optimization.
Viaweb had a scripting language called RTML that let advanced users
define their own page styles.  We found that RTML became a kind of
suggestion box, because users only used it when the predefined page
styles couldn't do what they wanted.  Originally the editor put
button bars across the page, for example, but after a number of
users used RTML to put buttons down the left 
<a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/I/paulgraham_1656_3563">side</a>, 
we made that an
option (in fact the default) in the predefined page styles.<br><br>Finally, by watching users you can often tell when they're in
trouble.  And since the customer is always right, that's a sign of
something you need to fix.  At Viaweb the key to getting users was
the online test drive.  It was not just a series of slides built
by marketing people.  In our test drive, users actually used the
software.  It took about five minutes, and at the end of it they
had built a real, working store.<br><br><!--[The <a href="http://edit.store.yahoo.com/RT/SIGNUP-STORE">test drive</a> 
is still online, but now
they make you fill out several forms, and don't tell you
that you've created a working store.  If you try the test
drive, here is how to find your store: if you choose foo as your
store id, the finished store will be at store.yahoo.com/foo.]
-->
The test drive was the way we got nearly all our new users.  I
think it will be the same for most Web-based applications.   If
users can get through a test drive successfully, they'll like the
product.  If they get confused or bored, they won't.  So anything
we could do to get more people through the test drive would increase
our growth rate.<br><br>I studied click trails of people taking the test drive and found
that at a certain step they would get confused and click on the
browser's Back button.  (If you try writing Web-based applications,
you'll find that the Back button becomes one of your most interesting
philosophical problems.) So I added a message at that point, telling
users that they were nearly finished, and reminding them not to
click on the Back button.  Another great thing about Web-based
software is that you get instant feedback from changes:  the number
of people completing the test drive rose immediately from 60% to
90%.  And since the number of new users was a function of the number
of completed test drives, our revenue growth increased by 50%, just
from that change.<br><br><b>Money</b><br><br>In the early 1990s I read an article in which someone said that
software was a subscription business.  At first this seemed a very
cynical statement.  But later I realized that it reflects reality:
software development is an ongoing process.  I think it's cleaner
if you openly charge subscription fees, instead of forcing people
to keep buying and installing new versions so that they'll keep
paying you.  And fortunately, subscriptions are the natural way to
bill for Web-based applications.<br><br>Hosting applications is an area where companies will play a role
that is not likely to be filled by freeware.  Hosting applications
is a lot of stress, and has real expenses.  No one is going to want
to do it for free.<br><br>For companies, Web-based applications are an ideal source of revenue.
Instead of starting each quarter with a blank slate, you have a
recurring revenue stream.  Because your software evolves gradually,
you don't have to worry that a new model will flop; there never
need be a new model, per se, and if you do something to the software
that users hate, you'll know right away.  You have no trouble with
uncollectable bills; if someone won't pay you can just turn off
the service.  And there is no possibility of piracy.<br><br>That last "advantage" may turn out to be a problem.  Some amount
of piracy is to the advantage of software companies.  If some user
really would not have bought your software at any price, you haven't
lost anything if he uses a pirated copy.  In fact you gain, because
he is one more user helping to make your software the standard--
or who might buy a copy later, when he graduates from high school.<br><br>When they can, companies like to do something called price
discrimination, which means charging each customer as much as they
can afford. [8] Software is particularly suitable for price
discrimination, because the marginal cost is close to zero.  This
is why some software costs more to run on Suns than on Intel boxes:
a company that uses Suns is not interested in saving money and can
safely be charged more.  Piracy is effectively the lowest tier of
price discrimination.  I think that software companies understand
this and deliberately turn a blind eye to some kinds of piracy. [9] 
With server-based software they are going to have to come up with 
some other solution.<br><br>Web-based software sells well, especially in comparison to desktop
software, because it's easy to buy.  You might think that people
decide to buy something, and then buy it, as two separate steps.
That's what I thought before Viaweb, to the extent I thought about
the question at all.  In fact the second step can propagate back
into the first: if something is hard to buy, people will change
their mind about whether they wanted it.  And vice versa: you'll
sell more of something when it's easy to buy.  I buy more books
because Amazon exists.  Web-based software is just about the easiest
thing in the world to buy, especially if you have just done an
online demo.  Users should not have to do much more than enter a
credit card number.  (Make them do more at your peril.)<br><br>
Sometimes Web-based software is offered through ISPs acting as
resellers.  This is a bad idea.  You have to be administering the
servers, because you need to be constantly improving both hardware
and software.  If you give up direct control of the servers, you
give up most of the advantages of developing Web-based applications.<br><br>Several of our competitors shot themselves in the foot this way--
usually, I think, because they were overrun by suits who were
excited about this huge potential channel, and didn't realize that
it would ruin the product they hoped to sell through it.  Selling
Web-based software through ISPs is like selling sushi through
vending machines.<br><br><b>Customers</b><br><br>Who will the customers be?  At Viaweb they were initially individuals
and smaller companies, and I think this will be the rule with
Web-based applications.  These are the users who are ready to try
new things, partly because they're more flexible, and partly because
they want the lower costs of new technology.<br><br>Web-based applications will often be the best thing for big companies
too (though they'll be slow to realize it).  The best intranet is
the Internet.  If a company uses true Web-based applications, the
software will work better, the servers will be better administered,
and employees will have access to the system from anywhere.<br><br>The argument against this approach usually hinges on security: if
access is easier for employees, it will be for bad guys too.  Some
larger merchants were reluctant to use Viaweb because they thought
customers' credit card information would be safer on their own
servers.  It was not easy to make this point diplomatically, but
in fact the data was almost certainly safer in our hands than
theirs.  Who can hire better people to manage security, a technology
startup whose whole business is running servers, or a clothing
retailer?  Not only did we have better people worrying about
security, we worried more about it.  If someone broke into the
clothing retailer's servers, it would affect at most one merchant,
could probably be hushed up, and in the worst case might get one
person fired.  If someone broke into ours, it could affect thousands
of merchants, would probably end up as news on CNet, and could put
us out of business.<br><br>If you want to keep your money safe, do you keep it under your
mattress at home, or put it in a bank? This argument applies to
every aspect of server administration:  not just security, but
uptime, bandwidth, load management, backups, etc.  Our existence
depended on doing these things right.  Server problems were the
big no-no for us, like a dangerous toy would be for a toy maker,
or a salmonella outbreak for a food processor.<br><br>A big company that uses Web-based applications is to that extent
outsourcing IT.  Drastic as it sounds, I think this is generally
a good idea.  Companies are likely to get better service this way
than they would from in-house system administrators.  System
administrators can become cranky and unresponsive because they're
not directly exposed to competitive pressure:  a salesman has to
deal with customers, and a developer has to deal with competitors'
software, but a system administrator, like an old bachelor, has
few external forces to keep him in line. [10]  At Viaweb we had
external forces in plenty to keep us in line. The people calling
us were customers, not just co-workers.  If a server got wedged,
we jumped; just thinking about it gives me a jolt of adrenaline,
years later.<br><br>So Web-based applications will ordinarily be the right answer for
big companies too.  They will be the last to realize it, however,
just as they were with desktop computers.  And partly for the same
reason: it will be worth a lot of money to convince big companies
that they need something more expensive.<br><br>There is always a tendency for rich customers to buy expensive
solutions, even when cheap solutions are better, because the people
offering expensive solutions can spend more to sell them.  At Viaweb
we were always up against this.  We lost several high-end merchants
to Web consulting firms who convinced them they'd be better off if
they paid half a million dollars for a custom-made online store on
their own server.  They were, as a rule, not better off, as more
than one discovered when Christmas shopping season came around and
loads rose on their server.  Viaweb was a lot more sophisticated
than what most of these merchants got, but we couldn't afford to
tell them.  At $300 a month, we couldn't afford to send a team of
well-dressed and authoritative-sounding people to make presentations
to customers.<br><br>A large part of what big companies pay extra for is the cost of
selling expensive things to them.  (If the Defense Department pays
a thousand dollars for toilet seats, it's partly because it costs
a lot to sell toilet seats for a thousand dollars.)  And this is
one reason intranet software will continue to thrive, even though
it is probably a bad idea.  It's simply more expensive.  There is
nothing you can do about this conundrum, so the best plan is to go
for the smaller customers first.  The rest will come in time.<br><br><b>Son of Server</b><br><br>Running software on the server is nothing new.  In fact it's the
old model: mainframe applications are all server-based.  If
server-based software is such a good idea, why did it lose last
time?  Why did desktop computers eclipse mainframes?<br><br>At first desktop computers didn't look like much of a threat.  The
first users were all hackers-- or hobbyists, as they were called
then.  They liked microcomputers because they were cheap.  For the
first time, you could have your own computer.  The phrase "personal
computer" is part of the language now, but when it was first used
it had a deliberately audacious sound, like the phrase "personal
satellite" would today.<br><br>Why did desktop computers take over? I think it was because they
had better software.  And I think the reason microcomputer software
was better was that it could be written by small companies.<br><br>I don't think many people realize how fragile and tentative startups
are in the earliest stage.  Many startups begin almost by accident--
as a couple guys, either with day jobs or in school, writing a
prototype of something that might, if it looks promising, turn into
a company. At this larval stage, any significant obstacle will stop
the startup dead in its tracks.  Writing mainframe software required
too much commitment up front.  Development machines were expensive,
and because the customers would be big companies, you'd need an
impressive-looking sales force to sell it to them.  Starting a
startup to write mainframe software would be a much more serious
undertaking than just hacking something together on your Apple II
in the evenings.  And so you didn't get a lot of startups writing
mainframe applications.<br><br>The arrival of desktop computers inspired a lot of new software,
because writing applications for them seemed an attainable goal to
larval startups.  Development was cheap, and the customers would
be individual people that you could reach through computer stores
or even by mail-order.<br><br>The application that pushed desktop computers out into the mainstream
was <a href="http://www.bricklin.com/visicalc.htm">VisiCalc</a>, the 
first spreadsheet.  It was written by two guys
working in an attic, and yet did things no mainframe software could
do. [11]  VisiCalc was such an advance, in its time, that people
bought Apple IIs just to run it.  And this was the beginning of a
trend: desktop computers won because startups wrote software for
them.<br><br>It looks as if server-based software will be good this time around,
because startups will write it.  Computers are so cheap now that
you can get started, as we did, using a desktop computer as a
server.  Inexpensive processors have eaten the workstation market
(you rarely even hear the word now) and are most of the way through
the server market; Yahoo's servers, which deal with loads as high
as any on the Internet, all have the same inexpensive Intel processors
that you have in your desktop machine.  And once you've written
the software, all you need to sell it is a Web site.  Nearly all
our users came direct to our site through word of mouth and references
in the press. [12]<br><br>Viaweb was a typical larval startup.  We were terrified of starting
a company, and for the first few months comforted ourselves by
treating the whole thing as an experiment that we might call off
at any moment.  Fortunately, there were few obstacles except
technical ones.  While we were writing the software, our Web server
was the same desktop machine we used for development, connected to
the outside world by a dialup line.  Our only expenses in that
phase were food and rent.<br><br>There is all the more reason for startups to write Web-based software
now, because writing desktop software has become a lot less fun.
If you want to write desktop software now you do it on Microsoft's
terms, calling their APIs and working around their buggy OS.  And
if you manage to write something that takes off, you may find that
you were merely doing market research for Microsoft.<br><br>If a company wants to make a platform that startups will build on,
they have to make it something that hackers themselves will want
to use.   That means it has to be inexpensive and well-designed.
The Mac was popular with hackers when it first came out, and a lot
of them wrote software for it. [13] You see this less with Windows,
because hackers don't use it.  The kind of people who are good at
writing software tend to be running Linux or FreeBSD now.<br><br>I don't think we would have started a startup to write desktop
software, because desktop software has to run on Windows, and before
we could write software for Windows we'd have to use it.  The Web 
let us do an end-run around Windows, and deliver software running 
on Unix direct to users through the browser.  That is a liberating 
prospect, a lot like the arrival of PCs twenty-five years ago.<br><br><b>Microsoft</b><br><br>Back when desktop computers arrived, IBM was the giant that everyone
was afraid of.  It's hard to imagine now, but I remember the feeling
very well.  Now the frightening giant is Microsoft, and I don't
think they are as blind to the threat facing them as IBM was.
After all, Microsoft deliberately built their business in IBM's
blind spot.<br><br>I mentioned earlier that my mother doesn't really need a desktop
computer.  Most users probably don't.  That's a problem for Microsoft,
and they know it.  If applications run on remote servers, no one
needs Windows.  What will Microsoft do?  Will they be able to use
their control of the desktop to prevent, or constrain, this new
generation of software?<br><br>My guess is that Microsoft will develop some kind of server/desktop
hybrid, where the operating system works together with servers they
control.  At a minimum, files will be centrally available for users
who want that.  I don't expect Microsoft to go all the way to the
extreme of doing the computations on the server, with only a browser
for a client, if they can avoid it. If you only need a browser for
a client, you don't need Microsoft on the client, and if Microsoft
doesn't control the client, they can't push users towards their
server-based applications.<br><br>I think Microsoft will have a hard time keeping the genie in the
bottle.  There will be too many different types of clients for them
to control them all.  And if Microsoft's applications only work
with some clients, competitors will be able to trump them by offering
applications that work from any client. [14]<br><br>In a world of Web-based applications, there is no automatic place
for Microsoft.  They may succeed in making themselves a place, but
I don't think they'll dominate this new world as they did the world
of desktop applications.<br><br>It's not so much that a competitor will trip them up as that they
will trip over themselves.  With the rise of Web-based software,
they will be facing not just technical problems but their own
wishful thinking.  What they need to do is cannibalize their existing
business, and I can't see them facing that.  The same single-mindedness
that has brought them this far will now be working against them.
IBM was in exactly the same situation, and they could not master
it.  IBM made a late and half-hearted entry into the microcomputer
business because they were ambivalent about threatening their cash
cow, mainframe computing.  Microsoft will likewise be hampered by
wanting to save the desktop.  A cash cow can be a damned heavy
monkey on your back.<br><br>I'm not saying that no one will dominate server-based applications.
Someone probably will eventually.  But I think that there will be
a good long period of cheerful chaos, just as there was in the
early days of microcomputers.  That was a good time for startups.
Lots of small companies flourished, and did it by making cool
things.<br><br><b>Startups but More So</b><br><br>The classic startup is fast and informal, with few people and little
money.  Those few people work very hard, and technology magnifies
the effect of the decisions they make.  If they win, they win big.<br><br>In a startup writing Web-based applications, everything you associate
with startups is taken to an extreme.  You can write and launch a
product with even fewer people and even less money.  You have to
be even faster, and you can get away with being more informal.
You can literally launch your product as three guys sitting in the
living room of an apartment, and a server collocated at an ISP.
We did.<br><br>Over time the teams have gotten smaller, faster, and more informal.
In 1960, software development meant a roomful of men with horn
rimmed glasses and narrow black neckties, industriously writing
ten lines of code a day on IBM coding forms.  In 1980, it was a
team of eight to ten people wearing jeans to the office and typing
into vt100s.  Now it's a couple of guys sitting in a living room
with laptops.  (And jeans turn out not to be the last word in
informality.)<br><br>Startups are stressful, and this, unfortunately, is also taken to
an extreme with Web-based applications.  
Many software companies, especially at the beginning, have periods
where the developers slept under their desks and so on.  The alarming
thing about Web-based software is that there is nothing to prevent
this becoming the default.  The stories about sleeping under desks
usually end:  then at last we shipped it and we all went home and
slept for a week.  Web-based software never ships.  You can work
16-hour days for as long as you want to.  And because you can, and
your competitors can, you tend to be forced to.  You can, so you
must.  It's Parkinson's Law running in reverse.<br><br>The worst thing is not the hours but the responsibility.  Programmers
and system administrators traditionally each have their own separate
worries.  Programmers have to worry about bugs, and system
administrators have to worry about infrastructure.  Programmers
may spend a long day up to their elbows in source code, but at some
point they get to go home and forget about it.  System administrators
never quite leave the job behind, but when they do get paged at
4:00 AM, they don't usually have to do anything very complicated.
With Web-based applications, these two kinds of stress get combined.
The programmers become system administrators, but without the
sharply defined limits that ordinarily make the job bearable.<br><br>At Viaweb we spent the first six months just writing software.  We
worked the usual long hours of an early startup.  In a desktop
software company, this would have been the part where we were
working hard, but it felt like a vacation compared to the next
phase, when we took users onto our server.  The second biggest
benefit of selling Viaweb to Yahoo (after the money) was to be able
to dump ultimate responsibility for the whole thing onto the
shoulders of a big company.<br><br>Desktop software forces users to become system administrators.
Web-based software forces programmers to.  There is less stress in
total, but more for the programmers.  That's not necessarily bad
news.  If you're a startup competing with a big company, it's good
news. [15]  Web-based applications offer a straightforward way to
outwork your competitors.  No startup asks for more.<br><br><b>Just Good Enough</b><br><br>One thing that might deter you from writing Web-based applications
is the lameness of Web pages as a UI.  That is a problem, I admit.
There were a few things we would have <i>really</i> liked to add to
HTML and HTTP.  What matters, though, is that Web pages are just
good enough.<br><br>There is a parallel here with the first microcomputers.  The
processors in those machines weren't actually intended to be the
CPUs of computers.  They were designed to be used in things like
traffic lights.  But guys like Ed Roberts, who designed the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800">Altair</a>,
realized that they were just good enough.  You could combine one
of these chips with some memory (256 bytes in the first Altair),
and front panel switches, and you'd have a working computer.  Being
able to have your own computer was so exciting that there were
plenty of people who wanted to buy them, however limited.<br><br>Web pages weren't designed to be a UI for applications, but they're
just good enough.  And for a significant number of users, software
that you can use from any browser will be enough of a win in itself
to outweigh any awkwardness in the UI.  Maybe you can't write the
best-looking spreadsheet using HTML, but you can write a spreadsheet
that several people can use simultaneously from different locations
without special client software, or that can incorporate live data
feeds, or that can page you when certain conditions are triggered.
More importantly, you can write new kinds of applications that
don't even have names yet.  VisiCalc was not merely a microcomputer
version of a mainframe application, after all-- it was a new type
of application.<br><br>Of course, server-based applications don't have to be Web-based.
You could have some other kind of client.  But I'm pretty sure
that's a bad idea.  It would be very convenient if you could assume
that everyone would install your client-- so convenient that you
could easily convince yourself that they all would-- but if they
don't, you're hosed.  Because Web-based software assumes nothing
about the client, it will work anywhere the Web works.  That's a
big advantage already, and the advantage will grow as new Web
devices proliferate.  Users will like you because your software
just works, and your life will be easier because you won't have to
tweak it for every new client.  <!-- I would not even use Javascript,
if I were you.  Viaweb didn't. --> [16]<br><br>I feel like I've watched the evolution of the Web as closely as
anyone, and I can't predict what's going to happen with clients.
Convergence is probably coming, but where?  I can't pick a winner.
One thing I can predict is conflict between AOL and Microsoft.
Whatever Microsoft's .NET turns out to be, it will probably involve
connecting the desktop to servers.  Unless AOL fights back, they
will either be pushed aside or turned into a pipe between Microsoft
client and server software.  If Microsoft and AOL get into a client
war, the only thing sure to work on both will be browsing the Web,
meaning Web-based applications will be the only kind that work
everywhere.<br><br>How will it all play out?  I don't know.  And you don't have to
know if you bet on Web-based applications.  No one can break that
without breaking browsing.  The Web may not be the only way to
deliver software, but it's one that works now and will continue to
work for a long time.  Web-based applications are cheap to develop,
and easy for even the smallest startup to deliver.  They're a lot
of work, and of a particularly stressful kind, but that only makes
the odds better for startups.<br><br><b>Why Not?</b><br><br>E. B. White was amused to learn from a farmer friend that many
electrified fences don't have any current running through them.
The cows apparently learn to stay away from them, and after that
you don't need the current.  "Rise up, cows!" he wrote, "Take your
liberty while despots snore!"<br><br>If you're a hacker who has thought of one day starting a startup,
there are probably two things keeping you from doing it.  One is
that you don't know anything about business.  The other is that
you're afraid of competition.  Neither of these fences have any
current in them.<br><br>There are only two things you have to know about business:  build
something users love, and make more than you spend.  If you get
these two right, you'll be ahead of most startups.  You can figure
out the rest as you go.<br><br>You may not at first make more than you spend, but as long as the
gap is closing fast enough you'll be ok.  If you start out underfunded,
it will at least encourage a habit of frugality.  The less you
spend, the easier it is to make more than you spend.  Fortunately,
it can be very cheap to launch a Web-based application.  We launched
on under $10,000, and it would be even cheaper today.  We had to
spend thousands on a server, and thousands more to get SSL.  (The
only company selling SSL software at the time was Netscape.)  Now
you can rent a much more powerful server, with SSL included, for
less than we paid for bandwidth alone.  You could launch a Web-based
application now for less than the cost of a fancy office chair.<br><br>As for building something users love, here are some general tips.
Start by making something clean and simple that you would want to
use yourself.  Get a version 1.0 out fast, then continue to improve
the software, listening closely to the users as you do.  The customer
is always right, but different customers are right about different
things; the least sophisticated users show you what you need to
simplify and clarify, and the most sophisticated tell you what
features you need to add. The best thing software can be is easy,
but the way to do this is to get the defaults right, not to limit
users' choices.  Don't get complacent if your competitors' software
is lame; the standard to compare your software to is what it could
be, not what your current competitors happen to have.  Use your
software yourself, all the time.  Viaweb was supposed to be an
online store builder, but we used it to make our own site too.
Don't listen to marketing people or designers or product managers
just because of their job titles.  If they have good ideas, use
them, but it's up to you to decide; software has to be designed by
hackers who understand design, not designers who know a little
about software.  If you can't design software as well as implement
it, don't start a startup.<br><br>Now let's talk about competition.  What you're afraid of is not
presumably groups of hackers like you, but actual companies, with
offices and business plans and salesmen and so on, right?  Well,
they are more afraid of you than you are of them, and they're right.
It's a lot easier for a couple of hackers to figure out how to rent
office space or hire sales people than it is for a company of any
size to get software written.  I've been on both sides, and I know.
When Viaweb was bought by Yahoo, I suddenly found myself working
for a big company, and it was like trying to run through waist-deep
water.<br><br>I don't mean to disparage Yahoo.  They had some good hackers, and
the top management were real butt-kickers.  For a big company, they
were exceptional.  But they were still only about a tenth as
productive as a small startup.  No big company can do much better
than that.  What's scary about Microsoft is that a company so
big can develop software at all.  They're like a mountain that
can walk.<br><br>Don't be intimidated.  You can do as much that Microsoft can't as
they can do that you can't.  And no one can stop you.  You don't
have to ask anyone's permission to develop Web-based applications.
You don't have to do licensing deals, or get shelf space in retail
stores, or grovel to have your application bundled with the OS.
You can deliver software right to the browser, and no one can get
between you and potential users without preventing them from browsing
the Web.<br><br>You may not believe it, but I promise you, Microsoft is scared of
you.  The complacent middle managers may not be, but Bill is,
because he was you once, back in 1975, the last time a new way of
delivering software appeared.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] Realizing that much of the money is in the services, companies
building lightweight clients have usually tried to combine the
hardware with an 
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1006-200-3622600.html">online service</a>. 
 This approach has not worked
well, partly because you need two different kinds of companies to
build consumer electronics and to run an online service, and partly
because users hate the idea.  Giving away the razor and making
money on the blades may work for Gillette, but a razor is much
smaller commitment than a Web terminal.  Cell phone handset makers
are satisfied to sell hardware without trying to capture the service
revenue as well.  That should probably be the model for Internet
clients too.  If someone just sold a nice-looking little box with
a Web browser that you could use to connect through any ISP, every
technophobe in the country would buy one.<br><br>[2] Security always depends more on not screwing up than any design
decision, but the nature of server-based software will make developers
pay more attention to not screwing up.  Compromising a server could
cause such damage that ASPs (that want to stay in business) are
likely to be careful about security.<br><br>[3] In 1995, when we started Viaweb, Java applets were supposed to
be the technology everyone was going to use to develop server-based
applications.  Applets seemed to us an old-fashioned idea.  Download
programs to run on the client? Simpler just to go all the way and
run the programs on the server.  We wasted little time
on applets, but countless other startups must have been lured into
this tar pit.  Few can have escaped alive, or Microsoft could not
have gotten away with dropping Java in the most recent version of
Explorer.<br><br>[4] This point is due to Trevor Blackwell, who adds "the cost of
writing software goes up more than linearly with its size.  Perhaps
this is mainly due to fixing old bugs, and the cost can be more
linear if all bugs are found quickly."<br><br>[5] The hardest kind of bug to find may be a variant of compound
bug where one bug happens to compensate for another.  When you fix
one bug, the other becomes visible.  But it will seem as if the
fix is at fault, since that was the last thing you changed.<br><br>[6] Within Viaweb we once had a contest to describe the worst thing
about our software.  Two customer support people tied for first
prize with entries I still shiver to recall.  We fixed both problems
immediately.<br><br>[7] Robert Morris wrote the ordering system, which shoppers used
to place orders. Trevor Blackwell wrote the image generator and
the manager, which merchants used to retrieve orders, view statistics,
and configure domain names etc.  I wrote the editor, which merchants
used to build their sites.  The ordering system and image generator
were written in C and C++, the manager mostly in Perl, and the editor
in <a href="avg.html">Lisp</a>.<br><br>[8] Price discrimination is so pervasive (how often have you heard
a retailer claim that their buying power meant lower prices for
you?) that I was surprised to find it was outlawed in the U.S. by
the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936.  This law does not appear to be
vigorously enforced.<br><br>[9] In <i>No Logo,</i> Naomi Klein says that clothing brands favored by
"urban youth" do not try too hard to prevent shoplifting because
in their target market the shoplifters are also the fashion leaders.<br><br>[10] Companies often wonder what to outsource and what not to.
One possible answer: outsource any job that's not directly exposed
to competitive pressure, because outsourcing it will thereby expose
it to competitive pressure.<br><br>[11] The two guys were Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston.  Dan wrote
a prototype in Basic in a couple days, then over the course of the
next year they worked together (mostly at night) to make a more
powerful version written in 6502 machine language.  Dan was at
Harvard Business School at the time and Bob nominally had a day
job writing software.  "There was no great risk in doing a business,"
Bob wrote, "If it failed it failed. No big deal."<br><br>[12] It's not quite as easy as I make it sound.  It took a painfully
long time for word of mouth to get going, and we did not start to
get a lot of press coverage until we hired a 
<a href="http://www.schwartz-pr.com">PR firm</a> 
(admittedly
the best in the business) for $16,000 per month.  However, it was
true that the only significant channel was our own Web site.<br><br>[13] If the Mac was so great, why did it lose?  Cost, again.
Microsoft concentrated on the software business, and unleashed a
swarm of cheap component suppliers on Apple hardware.  It did not
help, either, that suits took over during a critical period.<br><br>[14] One thing that would help Web-based applications, and help
keep the next generation of software from being overshadowed by
Microsoft, would be a good open-source browser.  Mozilla is
open-source but seems to have suffered from having been corporate
software for so long.  A small, fast browser that was actively
maintained would be a great thing in itself, and would probably
also encourage companies to build little Web appliances.<br><br>Among other things, a proper open-source browser would cause HTTP
and HTML to continue to evolve (as e.g. Perl has).  It would help
Web-based applications greatly to be able to distinguish between
selecting a link and following it; all you'd need to do this would
be a trivial enhancement of HTTP, to allow multiple urls in a
request.  Cascading menus would also be good.<br><br>If you want to change the world, write a new Mosaic.  Think it's
too late?  In 1998 a lot of people thought it was too late to launch
a new search engine, but Google proved them wrong.  There is always
room for something new if the current options suck enough.  Make
sure it works on all the free OSes first-- new things start with
their users.<br><br>[15] Trevor Blackwell, who probably knows more about this from
personal experience than anyone, writes:<br><br>"I would go farther in saying that because server-based software
is so hard on the programmers, it causes a fundamental economic
shift away from large companies. It requires the kind of intensity
and dedication from programmers that they will only be willing to
provide when it's their own company.  Software companies can hire
skilled people to work in a not-too-demanding environment, and can
hire unskilled people to endure hardships, but they can't hire
highly skilled people to bust their asses. Since capital is no
longer needed, big companies have little to bring to the table."<br><br>[16] In the original version of this essay, I advised avoiding
Javascript.  That was a good plan in 2001, but Javascript now works.
<!-- Most of the Javascript I see on the Web isn't necessary, and
much of it breaks.  (My mental picture of a Javascript programmer
is Wally from Dilbert, with a thought bubble over his head reading
"It works on my computer.") Yahoo uses Javascript in a few places,
though not many.  I once asked someone there how this worked out,
and he said "they ended up learning a <i>lot</i> about different browser
versions." Microsoft may start to embrace and extend Javascript,
or even can it, like Java.  And when you start to be able to browse
actual Web pages on your cell phone or PDA (or toaster), who knows
if they'll even support it? --><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sarah Harlin, Trevor Blackwell, Robert Morris, Eric Raymond, Ken Anderson,

May 2002)
<p align="justif">
<i>(This article came about in response to some questions on
the <a href="http://ll1.mit.edu">LL1</a> mailing list.  It is now
incorporated in <a href="icad.html">Revenge of the Nerds</a>.)</i><br><br>When McCarthy designed Lisp in the late 1950s, it was
a radical departure from existing languages,
the most important of which was <a href="history.html">Fortran</a>.<br><br>Lisp embodied nine new ideas:<br><br></p>
<b>1. Conditionals.</b>  A conditional is an if-then-else
construct.  We take these for granted now.  They were 
<a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/lisp/node2.html">invented</a>
by McCarthy in the course of developing Lisp. 
(Fortran at that time only had a conditional
goto, closely based on the branch instruction in the 
underlying hardware.)  McCarthy, who was on the Algol committee, got
conditionals into Algol, whence they spread to most other
languages.<br><br><b>2. A function type.</b> In Lisp, functions are first class 
objects-- they're a data type just like integers, strings,
etc, and have a literal representation, can be stored in variables,
can be passed as arguments, and so on.<br><br><b>3. Recursion.</b>  Recursion existed as a mathematical concept
before Lisp of course, but Lisp was the first programming language to support
it.  (It's arguably implicit in making functions first class
objects.)<br><br><b>4. A new concept of variables.</b>  In Lisp, all variables
are effectively pointers. Values are what
have types, not variables, and assigning or binding
variables means copying pointers, not what they point to.<br><br><b>5. Garbage-collection.</b><br><br><b>6. Programs composed of expressions.</b> Lisp programs are 
trees of expressions, each of which returns a value.  
(In some Lisps expressions
can return multiple values.)  This is in contrast to Fortran
and most succeeding languages, which distinguish between
expressions and statements.<br><br>It was natural to have this
distinction in Fortran because (not surprisingly in a language
where the input format was punched cards) the language was
line-oriented.  You could not nest statements.  And
so while you needed expressions for math to work, there was
no point in making anything else return a value, because
there could not be anything waiting for it.<br><br>This limitation
went away with the arrival of block-structured languages,
but by then it was too late. The distinction between
expressions and statements was entrenched.  It spread from 
Fortran into Algol and thence to both their descendants.<br><br>When a language is made entirely of expressions, you can
compose expressions however you want.  You can say either
(using <a href="arc.html">Arc</a> syntax)<br><br>(if foo (= x 1) (= x 2))<br><br>or<br><br>(= x (if foo 1 2))<br><br><b>7. A symbol type.</b>  Symbols differ from strings in that
you can test equality by comparing a pointer.<br><br><b>8. A notation for code</b> using trees of symbols.<br><br><b>9. The whole language always available.</b>  
There is
no real distinction between read-time, compile-time, and runtime.
You can compile or run code while reading, read or run code
while compiling, and read or compile code at runtime.<br><br>Running code at read-time lets users reprogram Lisp's syntax;
running code at compile-time is the basis of macros; compiling
at runtime is the basis of Lisp's use as an extension
language in programs like Emacs; and reading at runtime
enables programs to communicate using s-expressions, an
idea recently reinvented as XML.
<br><br>When Lisp was first invented, all these ideas were far
removed from ordinary programming practice, which was
dictated largely by the hardware available in the late 1950s.<br><br>Over time, the default language, embodied
in a succession of popular languages, has
gradually evolved toward Lisp.  1-5 are now widespread.
6 is starting to appear in the mainstream.
Python has a form of 7, though there doesn't seem to be
any syntax for it.  
8, which (with 9) is what makes Lisp macros
possible, is so far still unique to Lisp,
perhaps because (a) it requires those parens, or something 
just as bad, and (b) if you add that final increment of power, 
you can no 
longer claim to have invented a new language, but only
to have designed a new dialect of Lisp ; -)<br><br>Though useful to present-day programmers, it's
strange to describe Lisp in terms of its
variation from the random expedients other languages
adopted.  That was not, probably, how McCarthy
thought of it.  Lisp wasn't designed to fix the mistakes
in Fortran; it came about more as the byproduct of an
attempt to <a href="rootsoflisp.html">axiomatize computation</a>.<br><br><!-- Nor is this a complete list of ideas that began with Lisp
and spread to other languages.  These are only the initial
set.  Several more were developed in successive Lisp

There is a kind of mania for object-oriented programming at the moment, but
<!-- it seems to peak with medium-quality programmers.  -->
some of the <a href="reesoo.html">smartest programmers</a> I know are some of the least excited about it.<br><br>My own feeling is that object-oriented
programming is a useful technique in some
cases, but it isn't something that has to pervade every program you
write.  You should be able to define new types,
but you shouldn't have to express every program as the
definition of new types.<br><br>I think there are five reasons people like object-oriented   
programming, and three and a half of them are bad:<br><br></p><ol>
<li> Object-oriented programming is exciting   
if you have a statically-typed language without 
lexical closures or macros.  To some degree, it offers a way around these
limitations.  (See <a href="quotes.html">Greenspun's Tenth Rule</a>.)<br><br></li><li> Object-oriented programming is popular in big companies,
because it suits the way they write software.  At big companies,
software tends to be written by large (and frequently changing)  
teams of
mediocre programmers.  Object-oriented programming imposes a
discipline on these programmers that prevents any one of them
from doing too much damage.  The price is that the resulting
code is bloated with protocols and full of duplication.  
This is not too high a price for big companies, because their
software is probably going to be bloated and full of 
duplication anyway.<br><br></li><li> Object-oriented
programming generates a lot of what looks like work.
Back in the days of fanfold, there was a type of programmer who
would only put five or ten lines of code on a page, preceded
by twenty lines of elaborately formatted comments. 
Object-oriented programming is like crack for these people: it lets
you incorporate all this scaffolding right into your source
code.  Something that a Lisp hacker might handle by pushing
a symbol onto a list becomes a whole file of classes and
methods.  So it is a good tool if you want to convince yourself,
or someone else, that you are doing a lot of work.<br><br></li><li> If a language is itself an object-oriented program, it can
be extended by users.  Well, maybe.  Or maybe you can do
even better by offering the sub-concepts
of object-oriented programming a la carte.  Overloading, 
for example, is not intrinsically tied to classes.  We'll see.<br><br></li><li> Object-oriented abstractions map neatly onto the domains
of  certain specific kinds of programs, like simulations and CAD
systems.                                        
</li></ol>
</font><p align="justif"><font size="2" face="verdana">
I personally have never needed object-oriented abstractions.
Common Lisp has an enormously powerful object system and I've
never used it once.  I've done a lot of things (e.g. making         
hash tables full of closures) that would have required 
object-oriented techniques to do in wimpier languages, but
I have never had to use CLOS.<br><br>Maybe I'm just stupid, or have worked on some limited subset
of applications.  There is a danger in designing a language
based on one's own experience of programming.  But it seems
more dangerous to put stuff in that you've never needed 
because it's thought to be a good idea.<br><br></font></p></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="reesoo.html">Rees Re: OO</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.cibercalli.com/erick/hackingnews/porque-arc-no-es-especialmente-orientado-a-objetos">Spanish Translation</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

</div><div></div><div>
</div><font size="2" face="verdana">
</font></div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br>I was talking recently to a friend who teaches
at MIT.  His field is hot now and
every year he is inundated by applications from
would-be graduate students.  "A lot of them seem smart,"
he said.  "What I can't tell is whether they have any kind
of taste."<br><br>Taste.  You don't hear that word much now.
And yet we still need the underlying
concept, whatever we call it.  What my friend meant was
that he wanted students who were not just good technicians,
but who could use their technical knowledge to
design beautiful things.<br><br>Mathematicians call good work "beautiful,"
and so, either now or in the past, have
scientists, engineers, musicians, architects, designers,
writers, and painters.
Is it just a coincidence that they used the same word, or is   
there some overlap in what they meant?  If there
is an overlap, can we use one field's discoveries
about beauty to help us in another?<br><br>For those of us who design things, these are not just
theoretical questions.  If there is such a thing as
beauty, we need to be able to recognize it.  We need
good taste to make good things.
Instead of
treating beauty as an airy abstraction, to be either blathered
about or avoided depending on how one feels about airy
abstractions, let's try considering it as a practical question:
<i>how do you make good stuff?</i><br><br><br><br>If you mention taste nowadays, a lot of people will tell
you that "taste is subjective."
They believe this because it really feels that
way to them.  When they like something, they have no idea
why.  It could be because it's beautiful, or because their
mother had one, or because they saw a movie star with one
in a magazine, or because they know it's expensive.
Their thoughts are a tangle of unexamined impulses.<br><br>Most of us are encouraged, as children, to leave this tangle
unexamined.  If you make fun of your little brother for
coloring people green in his coloring book, your
mother is likely to tell you something like "you like to
do it your way and he likes to do it his way."<br><br>Your mother at this point is not trying to teach you
important truths about aesthetics.  She's trying to get
the two of you to stop bickering.<br><br>Like many of the half-truths adults tell us, this one
contradicts other things they tell us.  After dinning
into you that taste is merely a matter of personal preference,
they take you to the museum and tell you that you should
pay attention because Leonardo is a great artist.<br><br>What goes through the kid's head at this point?  What does
he think "great artist" means?  After having been
told for years that everyone just likes to do
things their own way, he is
unlikely to head straight for the conclusion that a great
artist is someone whose work is <i>better</i> than the others'.
A far more likely theory, in his Ptolemaic model of
the universe, is that a great artist is something that's
good for you, like broccoli, because someone said so in a book.<br><br><br><br>Saying that taste is just personal preference is a good way
to prevent disputes.  The trouble is, it's not true.
You feel this when you start to design things.<br><br>Whatever job people do, they naturally want to do better.
Football players
like to win games.  CEOs like to increase earnings.  It's
a matter of pride, and a real pleasure, to get better at
your job. But if
your job is to design things, and there is no such thing
as beauty, then there is <i>no way to get better at your job.</i>
If taste is just personal preference, then everyone's is   
already perfect: you like whatever you like, and that's it.<br><br>As in any job, as you continue to design things, you'll get
better at it.  Your tastes will change.  And, like anyone
who gets better at their job, you'll know you're getting
better.  If so,
your old tastes were
not merely different, but worse.  Poof goes the axiom that
taste can't be wrong.<br><br>Relativism is fashionable at the moment, and that may hamper
you from thinking about taste, even as yours grows.
But if you come out of the closet and admit, at least to yourself,
that there is such a thing as good and bad design, then you
can start to study good design in detail.
How has
your taste changed?  When you made mistakes, what
caused you to make them?  What have other people learned about
design?<br><br>Once you start to examine the question, it's surprising how
much different fields' ideas of beauty have in common.  The same
principles of good design crop up again and again.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design is simple.</b>  You hear this from math to
painting.  In math it means that a shorter proof tends to be
a better one.  Where axioms are concerned, especially,
less is more.  It means much the same thing in programming.
For architects and designers it means that beauty should
depend on a few carefully chosen structural elements
rather than a profusion of superficial ornament.  (Ornament
is not in itself bad, only when it's camouflage on insipid
form.)  Similarly, in painting, a
still life of a few carefully observed and solidly
modelled objects will tend to be more interesting than a
stretch of flashy
but mindlessly repetitive painting of, say, a lace collar.
In writing it means: say what you mean
and say it briefly.<br><br>It seems strange to have to emphasize simplicity.
You'd think simple would be the default.  Ornate
is more work.  But something seems to come over people
when they try to be creative.  Beginning writers adopt   
a pompous tone that doesn't sound anything like the way 
they speak.  Designers trying to be artistic resort to
swooshes and curlicues.  Painters discover that they're expressionists.
It's all evasion.
Underneath
the long words or the "expressive" brush strokes, there
is not much going on, and that's frightening.<br><br>When you're
forced to be simple, you're forced to face the real problem.
When you can't deliver ornament, you have to deliver
substance.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design is timeless.</b>
In math, every proof is timeless unless it contains a mistake.
So what does Hardy mean when he says there is no permanent 
place for ugly mathematics?  He means the same thing Kelly Johnson did:
if something is ugly, it can't be the best solution.  There
must be a better one, and eventually
someone will discover it.<br><br>Aiming at timelessness is a way to make
yourself find the best answer:
if you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself.
Some of the greatest masters did this so well that they
left little room for those who came after.
Every engraver since Durer has had to live in his shadow.<br><br>Aiming at timelessness is also a way to evade
the grip of fashion.  Fashions almost by definition
change with time, so if you can make something that
will still look good far into the future, then its
appeal must derive more from merit and less from fashion.<br><br>Strangely enough, if you want to make something that will 
appeal to future generations, one way to do it is to
try to appeal to past generations.  It's hard to guess what
the future will be like, but we can be sure it will be
like the past in caring nothing for present fashions.
So if you can make something that appeals to people today
and would also have appealed to people in 1500, there is a good
chance it will appeal to people in 2500.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design solves the right problem.</b> The typical
stove has four burners arranged in a square, and a dial
to control each.  How do you arrange the dials?  The
simplest answer is to put them in a row.  But this is a
simple answer to the wrong question.
The dials are for humans to use, and if you put them in a row,
the unlucky human will have to stop and think each time
about which dial matches which burner.  Better to arrange the dials
in a square like the burners.<br><br>A lot of bad design is industrious, but misguided.
In the mid twentieth century there was a vogue for
setting text in sans-serif fonts.
These fonts <i>are</i> closer to the pure, underlying letterforms.
But in text that's not the problem you're trying to solve. 
For legibility it's more important that letters be easy
to tell apart.
It may look Victorian, but a Times Roman lowercase g is
easy to tell from a lowercase y.<br><br>Problems can be improved as well as solutions.
In software, an intractable problem can usually be replaced
by an equivalent one that's easy to solve.
Physics progressed faster as the problem became
predicting observable behavior, instead of reconciling it
with scripture.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design is suggestive.</b>
Jane Austen's novels contain almost no
description; instead of telling you how
everything looks, she tells her story so well that you   
envision the scene for yourself.
Likewise, a painting that suggests is usually more engaging
than one that tells.  Everyone makes up their own story about the
Mona Lisa.<br><br>In architecture and design, this
principle means that a building or object should let you 
use it how you want: a good building, for example, will
serve as a backdrop for whatever life people want to lead in it, instead
of making them live as if they were executing a program
written by the architect.<br><br>In software, it means you should give users a few
basic elements that they can combine as they wish, like Lego. 
In math it means a proof that
becomes the basis for a lot of new work is
preferable to a proof that was difficult,
but doesn't lead to future discoveries; in the
sciences generally, citation is considered a rough
indicator of merit.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design is often slightly funny.</b>  This one
may not always be true.  But Durer's 
<a href="pilate.html">engravings</a>
and Saarinen's 
<a href="womb.html">womb chair</a> and the 
<a href="pantheon.html">Pantheon</a> and the
original <a href="1974-911s.html">Porsche 911</a> all seem
to me slightly funny.  Godel's incompleteness theorem
seems like a practical joke.<br><br>I think it's because humor is related to strength.
To have a sense of humor is to be strong:
to keep one's sense of humor is to shrug off misfortunes,
and to lose one's sense of humor is to be wounded by them.
And so the mark-- or at least the prerogative-- of strength
is not to take
oneself too seriously.
The confident will often, like
swallows, seem to be making fun of the whole process slightly,
as Hitchcock does in his films or Bruegel in his paintings-- or
Shakespeare, for that matter.<br><br>Good design may not have to be funny, but it's hard to
imagine something that could be called humorless also being
good design.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design is hard.</b>  If you look at the people who've
done great work, one thing they all seem to have in common is that they
worked very hard.  If you're not working hard,
you're probably wasting your time.<br><br>Hard problems call for great
efforts.  In math, difficult proofs require ingenious solutions,
and those tend to be interesting.  Ditto in engineering.<br><br>When you
have to climb a mountain you toss everything unnecessary
out of your pack.  And so an architect who has to build
on a difficult site, or a small budget, will find that he
is forced to produce an elegant design.  Fashions and
flourishes get knocked aside by the difficult business
of solving the problem at all.<br><br>Not every kind of hard is good.  There is good pain and bad pain.
You want the kind of pain you get from going running, not the
kind you get from stepping on a nail.
A difficult
problem could be good for a designer, but a fickle client or unreliable
materials would not be.<br><br>In art, the highest place has traditionally been given to
paintings of people.  There is something to this tradition,
and not just because pictures of faces get to press
buttons in our brains that other pictures don't.  We are 
so good at looking at faces that we force anyone who
draws them to work hard to satisfy us.  If you
draw a tree and you change the angle of a branch
five degrees, no one will know.  When you change the angle
of someone's eye five degrees, people notice.<br><br>When Bauhaus designers adopted Sullivan's "form follows function,"
what they meant was, form <i>should</i> follow function.  And
if function is hard enough, form is forced to follow it,
because there is no effort to spare for error.  Wild animals
are beautiful because they have hard lives.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design looks easy.</b>  Like great athletes,
great designers make it look easy.  Mostly this is
an illusion.  The easy, conversational tone of good
writing comes only on the eighth rewrite.<br><br>In science and engineering, some of the greatest
discoveries seem so simple that you say to yourself,
I could have thought of that.  The discoverer is
entitled to reply, why didn't you?<br><br>Some Leonardo heads are just a few lines.  You look
at them and you think, all you have to do is get eight
or ten lines in the right place and you've made this beautiful
portrait.  Well, yes, but you have to get them in
<i>exactly</i> the right place.  The slightest error
will make the whole thing collapse.<br><br>Line drawings are in fact the most difficult visual
medium, because they demand near perfection.
In math terms, they are a closed-form solution; lesser  
artists literally solve the same problems by successive
approximation.  One of the reasons kids give up drawing
at ten or so is that they decide to start
drawing like grownups, and one of the first things
they try is a line drawing of a face.  Smack!<br><br>In most fields the appearance of ease seems to come with
practice.  Perhaps what practice does is train your
unconscious mind to handle tasks that used to
require conscious thought.  In some cases
you literally train your body.  An expert pianist can
play notes faster than the brain can send signals to
his hand.  
Likewise an artist, after a while, can
make visual perception flow in through his eye and
out through his hand as automatically as someone tapping his foot to
a beat.<br><br>When people talk about being in
"the zone," I think what they mean is that the
spinal cord has the situation under control.
Your spinal cord is less hesitant, and
it frees conscious thought for the hard problems.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Good design uses symmetry.</b>
I think symmetry may just
be one way to achieve simplicity, but it's important enough
to be mentioned on its own.
Nature uses it a lot, which is a good sign.<br><br>There are two kinds of symmetry, repetition and recursion.
Recursion means repetition in subelements, like the
pattern of veins in a leaf.<br><br>Symmetry is unfashionable in some fields now, in reaction to
excesses in the past.  Architects started consciously
making buildings asymmetric in Victorian times and by the
1920s asymmetry was an explicit premise of modernist architecture.
Even these buildings only tended to be asymmetric
about major axes, though; there were hundreds of minor symmetries.<br><br>In writing you find symmetry at every level, from the phrases
in a sentence to the plot of a novel.  You find the same
in music and art.
Mosaics (and some Cezannes) get extra visual punch by making
the whole picture out of the same atoms.  Compositional 
symmetry yields some of the most memorable paintings,  
especially when two halves react to one another, as in 
the <i><a href="symptg.html">Creation of Adam</a></i> or 
<i><a href="symptg.html">American Gothic</a>.</i><br><br>In math and engineering, recursion, especially, is a big win.
Inductive proofs are wonderfully short.  In software,
a problem that can be solved by recursion is nearly always
best solved that way. The Eiffel Tower looks striking partly
because it is a recursive solution, a tower on a tower.<br><br>The danger of symmetry, and repetition especially, is that
it can be used as a substitute for thought.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design resembles nature.</b>  It's not so much that
resembling nature is intrinsically good as that nature
has had a long time to work on the
problem.  It's a good sign when your answer resembles nature's.<br><br>It's not cheating to copy.
Few would deny that a story should be like life.
Working from life is a valuable tool in painting too, though its
role has often been misunderstood.
The aim is not simply to make a record.
The point of painting from life is
that it gives your mind something to chew on:  when your
eyes are looking at something, your hand will do more
interesting work.<br><br>Imitating nature also works in engineering.  Boats have
long had spines and ribs like an animal's ribcage.
In some cases we may have to wait for better technology:
early aircraft designers were mistaken to
design aircraft that looked like birds, because they didn't
have materials or power sources light enough (the Wrights' engine
weighed 152 lbs. and
generated only 12 hp.) or control systems sophisticated
enough for machines that flew like birds, but I could
imagine little unmanned reconnaissance planes flying
like birds in fifty years.<br><br>Now that we have enough computer power, we can imitate nature's   
method as well as its results.  Genetic algorithms may let us
create things too complex to design in the ordinary
sense.<br><br><br><br><b>Good design is redesign.</b>  It's rare to get things right
the first time.  Experts expect to throw away some early work.
They plan for plans to change.<br><br>It takes confidence to throw work away.  You have to be able 
to think, <i>there's more where that came from.</i>   
When people first start drawing, for example,
they're often reluctant to redo parts that aren't
right; they feel they've been lucky to get that far,   
and if they try to redo something, it will turn out worse.  Instead
they convince themselves that the drawing is not that bad,
really-- in fact, maybe they meant it to look that way.<br><br>Dangerous territory, that; if anything you should
cultivate dissatisfaction.
In Leonardo's <a href="leonardo.html">drawings</a> there are often five
or six attempts to get a line right.
The distinctive back of the Porsche
911 only appeared in the redesign of an awkward 
<a href="porsche695.html">prototype</a>.
In Wright's early plans for the 
<a href="guggen.html">Guggenheim</a>,
the right half was a ziggurat; he inverted it to get the
present shape.<br><br>Mistakes are natural.  Instead of treating them
as disasters, make them easy to acknowledge and easy to fix.
Leonardo more or less invented the sketch, as a
way to make drawing bear a greater weight of exploration.
Open-source software has fewer bugs because it admits the
possibility of bugs.<br><br>It helps to have a medium that makes change easy.
When oil paint replaced tempera in the fifteenth century,
it helped
painters to deal with difficult subjects like the human 
figure because, unlike tempera, oil can be blended and overpainted.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Good design can copy.</b>  Attitudes to copying
often make a round trip.  A novice
imitates without knowing it; next he tries
consciously to be original; finally, he decides it's
more important to be right than original.<br><br>Unknowing imitation is almost a recipe for bad design.
If you don't know where your ideas are coming from,
you're probably imitating an imitator.
Raphael so pervaded mid-nineteenth century taste that almost 
anyone who tried to draw was imitating him, often at several
removes.
It was this, more than Raphael's own work, that bothered
the Pre-Raphaelites.<br><br>The ambitious are not content to imitate. The
second phase in the growth of taste is a conscious
attempt at originality.<br><br>I think the
greatest masters go on to achieve a kind of selflessness.
They just want to get the right answer, and if part of the
right answer has already been discovered by someone else,
that's no reason not to use it.
They're confident enough to take from anyone without
feeling that their own vision will be lost in the process.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Good design is often strange.</b>  Some of the very best work
has an uncanny quality: <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulerFormula.html">Euler's 
Formula</a>, 
Bruegel's
<i><a href="hunters.html">Hunters in the Snow</a>,</i> the 
<a href="sr71.html">SR-71</a>, <a href="rootsoflisp.html">Lisp</a>.  They're not just
beautiful, but strangely beautiful.<br><br>I'm not sure why.  It may just be my own stupidity.  A
can-opener must seem miraculous to a dog.  Maybe if I were smart
enough it would seem the most natural thing in the world that
e<sup>i*pi</sup> = -1.  It is after all necessarily true.<br><br>Most of the qualities I've mentioned are things that can be
cultivated, but I don't think it works to cultivate strangeness.
The best you can do is not squash it if it starts to appear.
Einstein didn't try to make relativity strange.
He tried to make it true, and the truth turned out to be strange.<br><br>At an art school where I once studied, the students wanted
most of all to develop a personal style.
But if you just try to make good things, you'll  
inevitably do it in a distinctive way, just as each person
walks in a distinctive way.  Michelangelo was not trying
to paint like Michelangelo.  He was just trying to paint
well; he couldn't help painting like Michelangelo.<br><br>The only style worth having is the one you can't help.
And this is especially true for strangeness.  There is no
shortcut to it.  The Northwest Passage that the Mannerists,
the Romantics, and two generations of American high school
students have searched for does not seem to exist.  The
only way to get there is to go through good and come out
the other side.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Good design happens in chunks.</b>  The inhabitants
of fifteenth century Florence included Brunelleschi, Ghiberti,
Donatello, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, 
Fra Angelico, Verrocchio, Botticelli, Leonardo, and Michelangelo.
Milan at the time was as big as Florence.
How many fifteenth century Milanese artists can you name?<br><br>Something was happening in Florence in the fifteenth century.
And it can't have been heredity, because it isn't happening now.
You have to assume that whatever
inborn ability Leonardo and Michelangelo had, there were
people born in Milan with just as much.  What happened to
the Milanese Leonardo?<br><br>There are roughly a thousand times
as many people alive in the US right now as lived in
Florence during the fifteenth century.  A thousand Leonardos
and a thousand Michelangelos walk among us.
If DNA ruled, we should be greeted daily by artistic
marvels.  We aren't, and the reason is that to make Leonardo
you need more than his innate ability.  You also need Florence 
in 1450.<br><br>Nothing is more powerful
than a community of talented people working on related
problems.  Genes count for little by comparison: being a genetic
Leonardo was not enough to compensate for having been born   
near Milan instead of Florence.
Today we move around more, but great work still comes
disproportionately from a few hotspots:
the Bauhaus, the Manhattan Project, the <i>New Yorker,</i>
Lockheed's Skunk Works, Xerox Parc.<br><br>At any given time there are a
few hot topics and a few groups doing great work on them,
and it's nearly impossible to do
good work yourself if you're too far removed from one
of these centers.  You can push or pull these trends
to some extent, but you can't break away from them.
(Maybe <i>you</i> can, but the Milanese Leonardo couldn't.)<br><br><br><br>
<b>Good design is often daring.</b>  At every period   
of history, people have believed things that were just   
ridiculous, and believed them so strongly that you risked  
ostracism or even violence by saying otherwise.<br><br>If our own time were any different, that would be remarkable.
As far as I can tell it <a href="say.html">isn't</a>.<br><br>This problem afflicts not just every
era, but in some degree every field.
Much Renaissance art was in its time considered shockingly secular:
according to Vasari, Botticelli repented and gave up painting, and
Fra Bartolommeo and Lorenzo di Credi actually burned some of their
work.
Einstein's theory of relativity offended many contemporary physicists,
and was not fully accepted for decades-- in France, not until the
1950s.<br><br>Today's experimental error is tomorrow's new theory.  If
you want to discover great new things, then instead of turning
a blind eye to the places where conventional wisdom and
truth don't quite meet, you should pay particular attention 
to them.<br><br><br><br>As a practical matter, I think it's easier to see ugliness
than to imagine beauty.  Most of the people who've made beautiful
things seem to have done it by fixing something that they    
thought ugly.  Great work usually seems to happen because someone sees
something and thinks, <i>I could do better than that.</i>  Giotto
saw traditional Byzantine madonnas painted according to a
formula that had satisfied everyone for centuries, and to him
they looked wooden and unnatural.
Copernicus was so troubled by a hack that all his contemporaries
could tolerate that he felt there must be a better solution.<br><br>Intolerance for ugliness is not in itself enough.  You have to
understand a field well before you develop a good nose for
what needs fixing.  You have to do your homework.  But as
you become expert in a field, you'll start to hear little
voices saying, <i>What a hack!  There must be a better way.</i>
Don't ignore those voices.  Cultivate them.  The recipe for
great work is: very exacting taste, plus the ability
to gratify it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br><a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/sullivan.html?t=1688221954&amp;">Sullivan</a>
 actually said "form ever follows function," but   
I think the usual misquotation is closer to what modernist
architects meant.<br><br>

In the discussion about issues raised by <a href="icad.html">Revenge 
of the Nerds</a> on the LL1 mailing list, Paul Prescod wrote
something that stuck in my mind.
<blockquote>
Python's goal is regularity and readability, not succinctness.
</blockquote>
On the face of it, this seems a rather damning thing to claim about a 
programming language.  As far as I can tell, succinctness = power.
If so, then substituting, we get
<blockquote>
Python's goal is regularity and readability, not power.
</blockquote>
and this doesn't seem a tradeoff (if it <i>is</i> a tradeoff)
that you'd want to make. 
It's not far from saying that Python's goal is not to be effective 
as a programming language.<br><br>Does succinctness = power?  This seems to me an important question,
maybe the most important question for anyone interested in
language design, and one that it would be useful to confront
directly.  I don't feel sure yet that the answer is a simple yes, but it seems 
a good hypothesis to begin with.<br><br><b>Hypothesis</b><br><br>My hypothesis is that succinctness is power, or is close enough
that except in pathological examples you can treat them as 
identical.<br><br>It seems to me that succinctness is what programming languages are 
<i>for.</i>  Computers would be just as happy to be told what to
do directly in machine language.  I think that the main
reason we take the trouble to develop high-level languages is to
get leverage, so that we can say (and more importantly, think)
in 10 lines of a high-level language what would require 1000
lines of machine language.  In other words,
the main point of high-level languages is to make source code smaller.<br><br>If smaller source code is the purpose of high-level languages, and
the power of something is how well it achieves its purpose, then
the measure of the power of a programming language is how small it
makes your programs.<br><br>Conversely, a language that doesn't make your programs small is
doing a bad job of what programming languages are supposed to
do, like a knife that doesn't cut well, or printing that's illegible.
<!-- (There are niches for both of these, e.g. plastic knives made for
children, or the way warning messages are printed on cigarette
packages, but I think few languages want to be in such a niche.) --><br><br><b>Metrics</b><br><br>Small in what sense though?  The most common measure of code size is
lines of code.  But I think that this metric is the most common because
it is the easiest to measure.  I don't think anyone really believes
it is the true test of the length of a program. Different
languages have different conventions for how much you should put
on a line; in C a lot of lines have nothing on them but a delimiter or two.<br><br>Another easy test is the number of characters in a 
program, but this is not very good either; some languages (Perl,
for example) just
use shorter identifiers than others.<br><br>I think a better measure of the size of a program would be the 
number of elements, where an element is anything that
would be a distinct node if you drew a tree representing the 
source code. The name of
a variable or function is an element; 
an integer or a floating-point number is an element;
a segment of literal text is an element;
an element of a pattern, or a format directive, is an element;
a new block is an element.  There are borderline cases
(is -5 two elements or one?) but I think most of them are the
same for every language, so they don't affect comparisons much.<br><br>This metric needs fleshing out, and
it could require interpretation in the case of specific languages,
but I think it tries to measure the right thing, which is the 
number of parts a program has.  I think the tree you'd draw in this
exercise is what you have to make in your head in order to
conceive of the program, and so its size is proportionate to the
amount of work you have to do to write or read it.<br><br><b>Design</b><br><br>This kind of metric would allow us to compare different languages,
but that is not, at least for me, its main value.  The main value
of the succinctness test is as a guide in <i>designing</i> languages.
The most useful comparison between languages is between two
potential variants of the same language.  What can I do in the
language to make programs shorter?<br><br>If the conceptual load of
a program is proportionate to its complexity, and a given programmer
can tolerate a fixed conceptual load, then this is the same as asking,
what can I do to enable programmers to get the most done?  And
that seems to me identical to asking, how can I design a good
language?<br><br>(Incidentally, nothing makes it more patently obvious that the old
chestnut "all languages are equivalent" is false than designing
languages.  When you are designing a new language, you're <i>constantly</i>
comparing two languages-- the language if I did x, and if I didn't-- to
decide which is better.  If this were really a meaningless question,
you might as well flip a coin.)<br><br>Aiming for succinctness seems a good way to find new ideas.
If you can do something that makes many
different programs shorter, it is probably not a coincidence: you have 
probably discovered a useful new abstraction.  You might even be
able to write a program to help by searching
source code for repeated patterns.  Among other languages, those
with a reputation for succinctness would be the ones to look to for
new ideas: Forth, Joy, Icon.<br><br><b>Comparison</b><br><br>The first person to write about these issues, as far as I know, was
Fred Brooks in the <i>Mythical Man Month</i>.  He wrote
that programmers seemed to generate about the same
amount of code per day regardless of the language.
When I first read this in my early twenties,
it was a big surprise to me and seemed to have huge implications.
It meant that (a) the only way to get software written faster was to
use a more succinct language, and (b) someone who took the
trouble to do this could leave competitors who didn't in the dust.<br><br>Brooks' hypothesis, if it's true, seems to be at the very heart of hacking.
In the years since, I've paid close attention to any evidence I could
get on the question, from formal studies to anecdotes about individual
projects.   I have seen nothing to contradict him.<br><br>I have not yet seen evidence that seemed to me conclusive,
and I don't expect to.  Studies
like Lutz Prechelt's comparison of programming languages, while
generating the kind of results I expected, tend to use problems that
are too short to be meaningful tests.  A better test of a language is
what happens in programs that take a month to write.  And the only
real test, if you believe as I do that the main purpose of a language
is to be good to think in (rather than just to tell a computer what to
do once you've thought of it) is what new things you can write in it.
So any language comparison where
you have to meet a predefined spec is testing slightly the wrong
thing.<br><br>The true test of a language is how well you can discover
and solve new problems, not
how well you can use it to solve a problem someone else has
already formulated.  These two are quite different criteria.
In art, mediums like embroidery and mosaic work well if you
know beforehand what you want to make, but are absolutely lousy if
you don't.  When you want to discover the image as you make it--
as you have to do with anything as complex as an image of a
person, for example-- you need to use a more fluid medium like pencil or
ink wash or oil paint.  And indeed, the way tapestries and mosaics are made in
practice is to make a painting first, then copy it.  (The word
"cartoon" was originally used to describe a painting intended for
this purpose).<br><br>What this means is that we are never likely to have accurate comparisons
of the relative power of programming languages.  We'll have precise
comparisons, but not accurate ones.  In particular, explicit studies
for the purpose of comparing languages,
because they will probably use small problems, and will necessarily use
predefined problems, will tend to underestimate the power of the
more powerful languages.<br><br>Reports from the field, though they will necessarily be less precise than
"scientific" studies, are likely to be more meaningful.  For example, 
Ulf Wiger of Ericsson did a 
<a href="http://www.erlang.se/publications/Ulf_Wiger.pdf">study</a> that 
concluded that Erlang was 4-10x
more succinct than C++, and proportionately faster to develop 
software in:
<blockquote>
Comparisons between Ericsson-internal development projects indicate
similar line/hour productivity, including all phases of software development,
rather independently of which language (Erlang, PLEX, C, C++, or Java)
was used.  What differentiates the different languages then becomes source
code volume.
</blockquote>
 The study also deals explictly with a point that was 
only implicit in Brooks' book (since he measured lines of debugged code):
programs written in more powerful languages tend to have fewer bugs.
That becomes an end in itself, possibly more important than programmer
productivity, in applications like network switches.<br><br><b>The Taste Test</b><br><br>Ultimately, I think you have to go with your gut.  What does it feel
like to program in the language?  I think the way to find (or design)
the best language is to become hypersensitive to how well a language
lets you think, then choose/design the language that feels best.  If
some language feature is awkward or restricting, don't worry, you'll
know about it.<br><br>Such hypersensitivity will come at a cost.  You'll find that you can't
<i>stand</i> programming in clumsy languages.   I find it unbearably
restrictive to program in languages without macros, just as someone used
to dynamic typing finds it unbearably restrictive to have to go back to
programming in a language where you have to declare the type of
every variable, and can't make a list of objects of different types.
<!-- (It's like one of those nightmares where you have to go back to 
high school.) --><br><br>I'm not the only one.  I know many Lisp hackers that this has happened
to.  In fact, the most accurate measure of the relative power of programming
languages might be the percentage of people who know the language
who will take any job where they get to use that language, regardless
of the application domain.<br><br><b>Restrictiveness</b><br><br>I think most hackers know what it means for a language to feel restrictive.
What's happening when you feel that?  I think it's the same feeling
you get when the street you want to take is blocked off, and you have to
take a long detour to get where you wanted to go.  There is something
you want to say, and the language won't let you.<br><br>What's really going on here, I think, is that a restrictive language is
one that isn't succinct enough.  The problem is not simply that you can't
say what you planned to.  It's that the detour the language makes you
take is <i>longer.</i>  Try this thought experiment.  Suppose there were
some program you wanted to write, and the language wouldn't let you
express it the way you planned to, but instead forced you to write the
program in some other way that was <i>shorter.</i>  For me at least,
that wouldn't feel very restrictive.  It would be like the street you
wanted to take being blocked off, and the policeman at the 
intersection directing you to a shortcut instead of a detour.  Great!<br><br>I think most (ninety percent?) of 
the feeling of restrictiveness comes from being forced to make the program
you write in the language longer than one you have in your head.
Restrictiveness is mostly lack of succinctness.
So when a language feels restrictive, what that (mostly) means is that it isn't
succinct enough, and when a language isn't succinct, it will
feel restrictive.<br><br><b>Readability</b><br><br>The quote I began with mentions two other qualities, regularity and
readability.  I'm not sure what regularity is, or what advantage, 
if any, code that is regular and readable has over code that is merely
readable.  But I think I know what is meant by readability, and I think
it is also related to succinctness.<br><br>We have to be careful here to distinguish between the readability of
an individual line of code and the readability of the whole program.
It's the second that matters.  I agree that a line of Basic is likely to be
more readable than a line of Lisp.  But a program written in Basic is
is going to have more lines than the same program written in
Lisp (especially once you cross over into Greenspunland). The
total effort of reading the Basic program will surely be greater.
<blockquote>
total effort  = effort per line x number of lines
</blockquote>
I'm not as sure that readability is directly proportionate to succinctness
as I am that power is, but certainly succinctness is a factor 
(in the mathematical sense; see equation above) in readability.
So it may not even be meaningful to say that the goal of a language is
readability, not succinctness; it could be like saying the goal was readability,
not readability.<br><br>What readability-per-line does mean, to the user encountering the language
for the first time, is that source code will <i>look unthreatening</i>.  So
readability-per-line
could be a good marketing decision, even if it is a bad design
decision.  It's isomorphic to the very successful technique of letting
people pay in installments: instead of frightening them with a high
upfront price, you tell them the low monthly payment.  Installment plans
are a net lose for the buyer, though, as mere readability-per-line probably
is for the programmer.
The buyer is going to make a <i>lot</i> of those low, low payments; and 
the programmer is going to read a <i>lot</i> of those individually readable lines.<br><br>This tradeoff predates programming languages.  If you're used to reading
novels and newspaper articles, your first experience of reading a math
paper can be dismaying.  It could take half an hour to read a single page.  
And yet, I am pretty sure that the notation is not the problem, even though
it may feel like it is.  The math paper is hard to read 
because the ideas are hard.  If you expressed the same ideas in prose
(as mathematicians had to do before they evolved succinct notations),
they wouldn't be any easier to read, because the paper would grow to the
size of a book.<br><br><b>To What Extent?</b><br><br>A number of people have rejected
the idea that succinctness = power.  I think it would be more useful, instead
of simply arguing that they are the same or aren't, to ask:
to what <i>extent</i> does succinctness = power?
Because clearly succinctness is
a large part of what higher-level languages are for.  If it is not all they're
for, then what else are they for, and how important, relatively, are these
other functions?<br><br>I'm not proposing this just to make the debate more civilized.  I really
want to know the answer.  When, if ever,  is a language too succinct for 
its own good?<br><br>The hypothesis I began with was that, except in pathological examples,
I thought succinctness could be considered identical with power.  What
I meant was that in any language anyone would design, they
would be identical, but that if someone wanted to design a language
explicitly to disprove this hypothesis, they could probably do it.  I'm
not even sure of that, actually.<br><br><b>Languages, not Programs</b><br><br>We should be clear that we are talking about the succinctness
of languages, not of individual programs.
It certainly is possible for individual programs to be written too densely.<br><br>I wrote about this in <a href="onlisp.html">On Lisp</a>. A complex macro
may have to save many times its own length to be justified.  If writing
some hairy macro could save you ten lines of code every time you use it,
and the macro is itself ten lines of code, then you get a net saving in
lines if you use it more than once.  But that could still be a bad move,
because macro definitions are harder to read than ordinary code.  You 
might have to use the macro ten or twenty times before it yielded a net
improvement in readability.<br><br>I'm sure every language has such tradeoffs (though I suspect the stakes
get higher as the language gets more powerful).  Every programmer must
have seen code that some clever person has made marginally shorter
by using dubious programming tricks.<br><br>So there is no argument about that-- at least, not from me.  Individual
programs can certainly be too succinct for their own good.  The question
is, can a language be?  Can a language compel programmers to write
code that's short (in elements) at the expense of overall readability?<br><br>One reason it's hard to imagine a language being too succinct is that if
there were some excessively compact way to phrase something, there would
probably also be a longer way.  For example, if you felt Lisp programs using
a lot of macros or higher-order functions were too dense,  you could, if you
preferred, write code that was isomorphic to Pascal.  If you
don't want to express factorial in Arc as a call to a higher-order function
<font face="courier"><xmp>
(rec zero 1 * 1-)
</xmp></font>
you can also write out a recursive definition:
<font face="courier"><xmp>
(rfn fact (x) (if (zero x) 1 (* x (fact (1- x)))))
</xmp></font>
Though I can't off the top of my head think of any examples, I am interested
in the question of whether a language could be too succinct.  Are there languages 
that force you to write code in a way that is crabbed and incomprehensible?
If anyone has examples, I would be very interested to see them.<br><br>(Reminder: What I'm looking for are programs that are very dense according
to the metric of "elements" sketched above, not merely programs that are

International ICAD User's Group conference in May 2002.
It explains how a language
developed in 1958 manages to be the most powerful  
available even today, what power is and when you need it, and
why pointy-haired bosses (ideally, your
competitors' pointy-haired bosses) deliberately ignore this issue.)<br /><br /><b>Note:</b> In this talk by "Lisp", I mean the Lisp family of<br /><br />languages, including Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp, EuLisp,
Goo, Arc, etc.</i><br /><br />
-->
<!-- Let me start by admitting that I don't know much about ICAD.
I do know that it's written in Lisp, and in fact includes Lisp,
in the sense that it lets users create and run Lisp programs.<br /><br />It's fairly common for programs written in Lisp to include
Lisp.  Emacs does, and so does Yahoo Store.
But if you think about it, that's kind of strange.
How many programs written in C include C, in the sense that   
the user actually runs the C compiler while he's using the
application?  I can't think of any, unless you count Unix
as an application.  We're only a minute into this talk and
already Lisp is looking kind of unusual.<br /><br />Now, it is probably not news to any of you that Lisp is   
looking unusual.  In fact, that was probably the first thing
you noticed about it.<br /><br />Believe it or not, there is a reason Lisp code looks
so strange.  Lisp doesn't look this way because it was designed
by a bunch of pointy-headed academics.  It <i>was</i>
designed by pointy-headed academics, but they had hard-headed  
engineering reasons for making the syntax look so strange.<br /><br /><b>Are All Languages Equivalent?</b>
-->
In the software business there is an ongoing
struggle between the pointy-headed academics, and another
equally formidable force, the pointy-haired bosses.  Everyone
knows who the pointy-haired boss is, right?  I think most
people in the technology world not only recognize this
cartoon character, but know the actual person in their company
that he is modelled upon.<br><br>The pointy-haired boss miraculously combines two qualities
that are common by themselves, but rarely seen together:
(a) he knows nothing whatsoever about technology, and
(b) he has very strong opinions about it.<br><br>Suppose, for example, you need to write a piece of software.
The pointy-haired boss has no idea how this software
has to work, and can't tell one programming language from
another, and yet he knows what language you should write it in.
Exactly.  He thinks you should write it in Java.<br><br>Why does he think this?  Let's
take a look inside the brain of the pointy-haired boss.  What
he's thinking is something like this.  Java is a standard.
I know it must be, because I read about it in the press all the time.
Since it is a standard, I won't get in trouble for using it.
And that also means there will always be lots of Java programmers,
so if the programmers working for me now quit, as programmers
working for me mysteriously always do, I can easily replace
them.<br><br>Well, this doesn't sound that unreasonable.  But it's all
based on one unspoken assumption, and that assumption
turns out to be false.  The pointy-haired boss believes that all
programming languages are pretty much equivalent.
If that were true, he would be right on
target.  If languages are all equivalent, sure, use whatever 
language everyone else is using.<br><br>But all languages are not equivalent, and I think I can prove
this to you without even getting into the differences between them.
If you asked the pointy-haired boss in 1992 what language     
software should be written in, he would have answered with as
little hesitation as he does today.  Software should be  
written in C++.  But if languages are all equivalent, why should the
pointy-haired boss's opinion ever change?  In fact, why should
the developers of Java have even bothered to create a new
language?<br><br>Presumably, if you create a new language, it's because you think
it's better in some way than what people already had.  And in fact, Gosling
makes it clear in the first Java white paper that Java
was designed to fix some problems with C++.
So there you have it: languages are not all equivalent.
If you follow the
trail through the pointy-haired boss's brain to Java and then
back through Java's history to its origins, you end up holding
an idea that contradicts the assumption you started with.<br><br>So, who's right?  James Gosling, or the pointy-haired boss?
Not surprisingly, Gosling is right.  Some languages <i>are</i> better,
for certain problems, than others.  And you know, that raises some
interesting questions.  Java was designed to be better, for certain
problems, than C++.  What problems?  When is Java better and 
when is C++?  Are there situations where other languages are
better than either of them?<br><br>Once you start considering this question, you have opened a
real can of worms.  If the pointy-haired boss had to think
about the problem in its full complexity, it would make his
brain explode.  As long as he considers all languages   
equivalent, all he has to do is choose the one
that seems to have the most momentum, and since that is more
a question of fashion than technology, even he
can probably get the right answer.
But if languages vary, he suddenly
has to solve two simultaneous equations, trying to find
an optimal balance between two things he knows nothing   
about: the relative suitability of the twenty or so leading
languages for the problem he needs to solve, and the odds of
finding programmers, libraries, etc. for each.
If that's what's on the other side of the door, it
is no surprise that the pointy-haired boss doesn't want to open it.<br><br>The disadvantage of believing that all programming languages
are equivalent is that it's not true.  But the advantage is 
that it makes your life a lot simpler.
And I think that's the main reason the idea is so widespread.
It is a <i>comfortable</i> idea.<br><br>We know that Java must be pretty good, because it is the
cool, new programming language.  Or is it?  If you look at the world of
programming languages from a distance, it looks like Java is
the latest thing.  (From far enough away, all you can see is
the large, flashing billboard paid for by Sun.)
But if you look at this world
up close, you find that there are degrees of coolness.  Within
the hacker subculture, there is another language called Perl
that is considered a lot cooler than Java.  Slashdot, for
example, is generated by Perl.  I don't think you would find
those guys using Java Server Pages.  But there is another,
newer language, called Python, whose users tend to look down on Perl,
and <a href="accgen.html">more</a> waiting in the wings.<br><br>If you look at these languages in order, Java, Perl, Python,
you notice an interesting pattern.  At least, you notice this
pattern if you are a Lisp hacker.  Each one is progressively 
more like Lisp.  Python copies even features
that many Lisp hackers consider to be mistakes.
You could translate simple Lisp programs into Python line for line.
It's 2002, and programming languages have almost caught up 
with 1958.<br><br><b>Catching Up with Math</b><br><br>What I mean is that
Lisp was first discovered by John McCarthy in 1958,
and popular programming languages are only now
catching up with the ideas he developed then.<br><br>Now, how could that be true?  Isn't computer technology something
that changes very rapidly?  I mean, in 1958, computers were
refrigerator-sized behemoths with the processing power of    
a wristwatch.  How could any technology that old even be
relevant, let alone superior to the latest developments?<br><br>I'll tell you how.  It's because Lisp was not really
designed to be a programming language, at least not in the sense
we mean today.  What we mean by a programming language is
something we use to tell a computer what to do.   McCarthy
did eventually intend to develop a programming language in
this sense, but the Lisp that we actually ended up with was based
on something separate that he did as a 
<a href="rootsoflisp.html">theoretical exercise</a>-- an effort
to define a more convenient alternative to the Turing Machine.
As McCarthy said later,
<p></p><blockquote>
Another way to show that Lisp was neater than Turing machines
was to write a universal Lisp function
and show that it is briefer and more comprehensible than the
description of a universal Turing machine.
This was the Lisp function <a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/jmc.lisp?t=1688221954&amp;"><i>eval</i></a>..., 
which computes the value of
a Lisp expression....
Writing <i>eval</i> required inventing a notation representing Lisp
functions as Lisp data, and such a notation
was devised for the purposes of the paper with no thought that
it would be used to express Lisp programs in practice.
</blockquote>
What happened next was that, some time in late 1958, Steve Russell,
one of McCarthy's
grad students, looked at this definition of <i>eval</i> and realized  
that if he translated it into machine language, the result
would be a Lisp interpreter.<br><br>This was a big surprise at the time.
Here is what McCarthy said about it later in an interview:
<blockquote>
Steve Russell said, look, why don't I program this <i>eval</i>..., and
I said to him, ho, ho, you're confusing theory with practice,
this <i>eval</i> is intended for reading, not for
computing. But he went ahead and did it. That is, he compiled the <i>eval</i>
in my paper into [IBM] 704 machine
code, fixing bugs, and then advertised this as a Lisp interpreter,
which it certainly was. So at that point Lisp
had essentially the form that it has today....
</blockquote>
Suddenly, in a matter of weeks I think, McCarthy found his theoretical
exercise transformed into an actual programming language-- and a
more powerful one than he had intended.<br><br>So the short explanation of why this 1950s language is not
obsolete is that it was not technology but math, and
math doesn't get stale.   The right thing to compare Lisp
to is not 1950s hardware, but, say, the Quicksort
algorithm, which was discovered in 1960 and is still
the fastest general-purpose sort.<br><br>There is one other language still
surviving from the 1950s, Fortran, and it represents the
opposite approach to language design.  Lisp was a
piece of theory that unexpectedly got turned into a
programming language.  Fortran was developed intentionally as
a programming language, but what we would now consider a
very low-level one.<br><br><a href="history.html">Fortran I</a>, the language that was
developed in 1956, was a very different animal from present-day
Fortran.   Fortran I was pretty much assembly
language with math.  In some ways it was less
powerful than more recent assembly languages; there were no   
subroutines, for example, only branches.
Present-day Fortran is now arguably closer to Lisp than to
Fortran I.<br><br>Lisp and Fortran were the trunks of two separate evolutionary trees, 
one rooted in math and one rooted in machine architecture.
These two trees have been converging ever since.
Lisp started out powerful, and over the next twenty years
got fast.  So-called mainstream languages started out
fast, and over the next forty years gradually got more powerful,
until now the most advanced
of them are fairly close to Lisp.
Close, but they are still missing a few things....<br><br><b>What Made Lisp Different</b><br><br>When it was first developed, Lisp embodied nine new
ideas.  Some of these we now take for granted, others are
only seen in more advanced languages, and two are still
unique to Lisp.  The nine ideas are, in order of their
adoption by the mainstream,
<ol>
<li> Conditionals.  A conditional is an if-then-else
construct.  We take these for granted now, but Fortran I
didn't have them. It had only a conditional goto
closely based on the underlying machine instruction.<br><br></li><li> A function type. In Lisp, functions are
a data type just like integers or strings.
They have a literal representation, can be stored in variables,
can be passed as arguments, and so on.<br><br></li><li> Recursion.  Lisp was the first programming language to
support it.<br><br></li><li> Dynamic typing.  In Lisp, all variables
are effectively pointers. Values are what
have types, not variables, and assigning or binding
variables means copying pointers, not what they point to.<br><br></li><li> Garbage-collection.<br><br></li><li> Programs composed of expressions.  Lisp programs are
trees of expressions, each of which returns a value.
This is in contrast to Fortran
and most succeeding languages, which distinguish between
expressions and statements.<br><br>It was natural to have this
distinction in Fortran I because
you could not nest statements.  And
so while you needed expressions for math to work, there was
no point in making anything else return a value, because
there could not be anything waiting for it.<br><br>This limitation
went away with the arrival of block-structured languages,
but by then it was too late. The distinction between
expressions and statements was entrenched.  It spread from
Fortran into Algol and then to both their descendants.<br><br></li><li> A symbol type.  Symbols are effectively pointers to strings
stored in a hash table.  So
you can test equality by comparing a pointer,
instead of comparing each character.<br><br></li><li> A notation for code using trees of symbols and constants.<br><br></li><li> The whole language there all the time.  There is
no real distinction between read-time, compile-time, and runtime.
You can compile or run code while reading, read or run code
while compiling, and read or compile code at runtime.<br><br>Running code at read-time lets users reprogram Lisp's syntax;
running code at compile-time is the basis of macros; compiling
at runtime is the basis of Lisp's use as an extension
language in programs like Emacs; and reading at runtime
enables programs to communicate using s-expressions, an
idea recently reinvented as XML.
</li></ol>
When Lisp first appeared, these ideas were far
removed from ordinary programming practice, which was
dictated largely by the hardware available in the late 1950s.
Over time, the default language, embodied
in a succession of popular languages, has
gradually evolved toward Lisp.  Ideas 1-5 are now widespread.
Number 6 is starting to appear in the mainstream.  
Python has a form of 7, though there doesn't seem to be    
any syntax for it.<br><br>As for number 8, this may be the most interesting of the
lot.  Ideas 8 and 9 only became part of Lisp
by accident, because Steve Russell implemented
something McCarthy had never intended to be implemented.
And yet these ideas turn out to be responsible for
both Lisp's strange appearance and its most distinctive
features.  Lisp looks strange not so much because
it has a strange syntax as because it has no syntax;
you express programs directly in the parse trees that
get built behind the scenes when other languages are
parsed, and these trees are made
of lists, which are Lisp data structures.<br><br>Expressing the language in its own data structures turns
out to be a very powerful feature. Ideas 8 and 9
together mean that you
can write programs that write programs.  That may sound
like a bizarre idea, but it's an everyday thing in Lisp. 
The most common way to do it is with something called a        
<i>macro.</i><br><br>The term "macro" does not mean in Lisp what it means in other
languages.
A Lisp macro can be anything from an abbreviation
to a compiler for a new language.
If you want to really understand Lisp,
or just expand your programming horizons, I would 
<a href="onlisp.html">learn more</a> about macros.<br><br>Macros (in the Lisp sense) are still, as far as
I know, unique to Lisp.
This is partly because in order to have macros you
probably have to make your language look as strange as
Lisp.  It may also be because if you do add that final
increment of power, you can no
longer claim to have invented a new language, but only
a new dialect of Lisp.<br><br>I mention this mostly
as a joke, but it is quite true. If you define
a language that has car, cdr, cons, quote, cond, atom,
eq, and
a notation for functions expressed as lists, then you
can build all the rest of Lisp out of it.  That is in
fact the defining quality of Lisp: it was in order to
make this so that McCarthy gave Lisp the shape it has.<br><br><b>Where Languages Matter</b><br><br>So suppose Lisp does represent a kind of limit     
that mainstream languages are approaching asymptotically-- does
that mean you should actually use it to write software?
How much do you lose by using a less powerful language?
Isn't it wiser, sometimes, not to be
at the very edge of innovation?
And isn't popularity to some extent
its own justification?  Isn't the pointy-haired boss right,
for example, to want to use a language for which he can easily
hire programmers?<br><br>There are, of course, projects where the choice of programming
language doesn't matter much.  As a
rule, the more demanding the application, the more
leverage you get from using a powerful language.  But
plenty of projects are not demanding at all.
Most programming probably consists of writing 
little glue programs, and for 
little glue programs you
can use any language that you're already
familiar with and that has good libraries for whatever you
need to do.  If you just need to feed data from one   
Windows app to another, sure, use Visual Basic.<br><br>You can write little glue programs in Lisp too
(I use it as a desktop calculator), but the biggest win
for languages like Lisp is at the other end of
the spectrum, where you need to write sophisticated
programs to solve hard problems in the face of fierce competition.
A good example is the
<a href="carl.html">airline fare search program</a> that ITA Software licenses to
Orbitz.  These
guys entered a market already dominated by two big,
entrenched competitors, Travelocity and Expedia, and  
seem to have just humiliated them technologically.<br><br>The core of ITA's application is a 200,000 line Common Lisp program
that searches many orders of magnitude more possibilities
than their competitors, who apparently
are still using mainframe-era programming techniques.
(Though ITA is also in a sense
using a mainframe-era programming language.)
I have never seen any of ITA's code, but according to
one of their top hackers they use a lot of macros,
and I am not surprised to hear it.<br><br><b>Centripetal Forces</b><br><br>I'm not saying there is no cost to using uncommon  
technologies.  The pointy-haired boss is not completely
mistaken to worry about this.  But because he doesn't understand
the risks, he tends to magnify them.<br><br>I can think of three problems that could arise from using
less common languages.  Your programs might not work well with
programs written in other languages.  You might have fewer
libraries at your disposal.  And you might have trouble
hiring programmers.<br><br>How much of a problem is each of these?  The importance of
the first varies depending on whether you have control
over the whole system.  If you're writing software that has
to run on a remote user's machine on top of a buggy,
closed operating system (I mention no names), there may be
advantages to writing your application in the
same language as the OS.
But if you control the whole system and
have the source code of all the parts, as ITA presumably does, you
can use whatever languages you want.  If
any incompatibility arises, you can fix it yourself.<br><br>In server-based applications you can
get away with using the most advanced technologies,
and I think this is the main
cause of what Jonathan Erickson calls the "<a href="http://www.byte.com/documents/s=1821/byt20011214s0003/">programming language
renaissance</a>."  This is why we even hear about new
languages like Perl and Python.  We're not hearing about these
languages because people are using them to write Windows
apps, but because people are using them on servers.  And as
software shifts 
<a href="road.html">off the desktop</a> and onto servers (a future even
Microsoft seems resigned to), there will be less
and less pressure to use middle-of-the-road technologies.<br><br>As for libraries, their importance also
depends on the application.  For less demanding problems,
the availability of libraries can outweigh the intrinsic power
of the language.  Where is the breakeven point?  Hard to say
exactly, but wherever it is, it is short of anything you'd
be likely to call an application.  If a company considers
itself to be in the software business, and they're writing
an application that will be one of their products,
then it will probably involve several hackers and take at
least six months to write.  In a project of that
size, powerful languages probably start to outweigh
the convenience of pre-existing libraries.<br><br>The third worry of the pointy-haired boss, the difficulty
of hiring programmers, I think is a red herring.   How many
hackers do you need to hire, after all?  Surely by now we
all know that software is best developed by teams of less
than ten people.   And you shouldn't have trouble hiring
hackers on that scale for any language anyone has ever heard
of.  If you can't find ten Lisp hackers, then your company is
probably based in the wrong city for developing software.<br><br>In fact, choosing a more powerful language probably decreases the
size of the team you need, because (a) if you use a more powerful
language you probably won't need as many hackers,
and (b) hackers who work in more advanced languages are likely
to be smarter.<br><br>I'm not saying that you won't get a lot of pressure to use
what are perceived as "standard" technologies.  At Viaweb
(now Yahoo Store),
we raised some eyebrows among VCs and potential acquirers by
using Lisp.  But we also raised eyebrows by using
generic Intel boxes as servers instead of
"industrial strength" servers like Suns, for using a
then-obscure open-source Unix variant called FreeBSD instead
of a real commercial OS like Windows NT, for ignoring
a supposed e-commerce standard called 
<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1017-225723.html">SET</a> that no one now
even remembers, and so on.<br><br>You can't let the suits make technical decisions for you.
Did it
alarm some potential acquirers that we used Lisp?  Some, slightly,
but if we hadn't used Lisp, we wouldn't have been
able to write the software that made them want to buy us.
What seemed like an anomaly to them was in fact
cause and effect.<br><br>If you start a startup, don't design your product to please
VCs or potential acquirers.  <i>Design your product to please
the users.</i>  If you win the users, everything else will
follow.  And if you don't, no one will care
how comfortingly orthodox your technology choices were.<br><br><b>The Cost of Being Average</b><br><br>How much do you lose by using a less powerful language?  
There is actually some data out there about that.<br><br>The most convenient measure of power is probably 
<a href="power.html">code size</a>.
The point of high-level
languages is to give you bigger abstractions-- bigger bricks,
as it were, so you don't need as many to build
a wall of a given size.
So the more powerful
the language, the shorter the program (not simply in
characters, of course, but in distinct elements).<br><br>How does a more powerful language enable you to write
shorter programs?  One technique you can use, if the language will
let you, is something called 
<a href="progbot.html">bottom-up programming</a>.  Instead of
simply writing your application in the base language, you
build on top of the base language a language for writing
programs like yours, then write your program
in it. The combined code can be much shorter than if you
had written your whole program in the base language-- indeed,
this is how most compression algorithms work.
A bottom-up program should be easier to modify as well,  
because in many cases the language layer won't have to change
at all.<br><br>Code size is important, because the time it takes
to write a program depends mostly on its length.
If your program would be three times as long in another
language, it will take three times as long to write-- and
you can't get around this by hiring more people, because
beyond a certain size new hires are actually a net lose.
Fred Brooks described this phenomenon in his famous
book <i>The Mythical Man-Month,</i> and everything I've seen
has tended to confirm what he said.<br><br>So how much shorter are your programs if you write them in
Lisp?  Most of the numbers I've heard for Lisp
versus C, for example, have been around 7-10x.
But a recent article about ITA in 
<a href="http://www.newarchitectmag.com/documents/s=2286/new1015626014044/"><i>New
Architect</i></a> magazine said that
"one line of Lisp can replace 20 lines of C," and since
this article was full of quotes from ITA's president, I
assume they got this number from ITA.  If so then
we can put some faith in it; ITA's software includes a lot
of C and  C++ as well as Lisp, so they are speaking from
experience.<br><br>My guess is that these multiples aren't even constant.
I think they increase when
you face harder problems and also when you have smarter
programmers.  A really good hacker can squeeze more
out of better tools.<br><br>As one data point on the curve, at any rate,
if you were to compete with ITA and
chose to write your software in C, they would be able to develop
software twenty times faster than you.
If you spent a year on a new feature, they'd be able to
duplicate it in less than three weeks.  Whereas if they spent
just three months developing something new, it would be
<i>five years</i> before you had it too.<br><br>And you know what?  That's the best-case scenario.
When you talk about code-size ratios, you're implicitly assuming
that you can actually write the program in the weaker language.
But in fact there are limits on what programmers can do.
If you're trying to solve a hard problem with a language that's
too low-level, you reach a point where there is just too 
much to keep in your head at once.<br><br>So when I say it would take ITA's imaginary
competitor five years to duplicate something ITA could
write in Lisp in three months, I mean five years
if nothing goes wrong.  In fact, the way things work in 
most companies, any
development project that would take five years is
likely never to get finished at all.<br><br>I admit this is an extreme case.  ITA's hackers seem to
be unusually smart, and C is a pretty low-level language.
But in a competitive market, even a differential of two or
three to one would
be enough to guarantee that you'd always be behind.<br><br><b>A Recipe</b><br><br>This is the kind of possibility that the pointy-haired boss
doesn't even want to think about.  And so most of them don't.
Because, you know, when it comes down to it, the pointy-haired
boss doesn't mind if his company gets their ass kicked, so
long as no one can prove it's his fault.
The safest plan for him personally
is to stick close to the center of the herd.<br><br>Within large organizations, the phrase used to
describe this approach is "industry best practice."
Its purpose is to shield the pointy-haired
boss from responsibility: if he chooses
something that is "industry best practice," and the company
loses, he can't be blamed.  He didn't choose, the industry did.<br><br>I believe this term was originally used to describe
accounting methods and so on.  What it means, roughly,
is <i>don't do anything weird.</i>  And in accounting that's
probably a good idea.  The terms "cutting-edge" and  
"accounting" do not sound good together.  But when you import
this criterion into decisions about technology, you start
to get the wrong answers.<br><br>Technology often <i>should</i> be
cutting-edge.  In programming languages, as Erann Gat
has pointed out, what "industry best practice"  actually
gets you is not the best, but merely the
average.  When a decision causes you to develop software at
a fraction of the rate of more aggressive competitors,  
"best practice" is a misnomer.<br><br>
So here we have two pieces of information that I think are
very valuable.  In fact, I know it from my own experience.
Number 1, languages vary in power.  Number 2, most managers
deliberately ignore this.  Between them, these two facts
are literally a recipe for making money.  ITA is an example
of this recipe in action.
If you want to win in a software
business, just take on the hardest problem you can find,
use the most powerful language you can get, and wait for
your competitors' pointy-haired bosses to revert to the mean.<br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<b>Appendix: Power</b><br><br>As an illustration of what I mean about the relative power
of programming languages, consider the following problem.
We want to write a function that generates accumulators-- a
function that takes a number n, and
returns a function that takes another number i and
returns n incremented by i.<br><br>(That's <i>incremented by</i>, not plus.  An accumulator
has to accumulate.)<br><br>In Common Lisp this would be
<font face="courier"><xmp>
(defun foo (n)
  (lambda (i) (incf n i)))
</xmp></font>
and in Perl 5,
<font face="courier"><xmp>
sub foo {  
  my ($n) = @_;
  sub {$n += shift}
}
</xmp></font>
which has more elements than the Lisp version because
you have to extract parameters manually in Perl.<br><br>In Smalltalk the code is slightly longer than in Lisp
<font face="courier"><xmp>
foo: n                              
  |s|                      
  s := n.                          
  ^[:i| s := s+i. ] 
</xmp></font>
because although in general lexical variables work, you can't
do an assignment to a parameter, so you have to create a
new variable s.<br><br>In Javascript the example is, again, slightly longer, because 
Javascript retains
the distinction between statements and
expressions, so you need explicit <tt>return</tt> statements
to return values:
<font face="courier"><xmp>
function foo(n) { 
  return function (i) { 
           return n += i } }
</xmp></font>
(To be fair, Perl also retains
this distinction, but deals with it in typical Perl fashion
by letting you omit <tt>return</tt>s.)<br><br>If you try to translate the Lisp/Perl/Smalltalk/Javascript code into 
Python you run into some limitations.  Because Python
doesn't fully support lexical variables,
you have to create a data structure to hold the value of n.
And although
Python does have a function data type, there is no
literal representation for one (unless the body is
only a single expression) so you need to create a named
function to return.  This is what you end up with:
<font face="courier"><xmp>
def foo(n):
  s = [n]
  def bar(i):
    s[0] += i
    return s[0] 
  return bar
</xmp></font>
Python users might legitimately ask why they can't
just write
<font face="courier"><xmp>
def foo(n):
  return lambda i: return n += i
</xmp></font>
or even
<font face="courier"><xmp>
def foo(n):
  lambda i: n += i
</xmp></font>
and my guess is that they probably will, one day.
(But if they don't want to wait for Python to evolve the rest
of the way into Lisp, they could always just...)
<!-- (Oscar Wilde: "I wish I had said that." Whistler: "You will,
Oscar, you will.")  --><br><br>In OO languages, you can, to a limited extent, simulate
a closure (a function that refers to variables defined in
enclosing scopes) by defining a class with one method
and a field to replace each variable from an enclosing
scope.  This makes the programmer do the kind of code
analysis that would be done by the compiler in a language
with full support for lexical scope, and it won't work
if more than one function refers to the same variable,
but it is enough in simple cases like this.<br><br>Python experts seem to agree that this is the
preferred way to solve the problem in Python, writing
either
<font face="courier"><xmp>
def foo(n):
  class acc:
    def __init__(self, s):
        self.s = s
    def inc(self, i):
        self.s += i
        return self.s
  return acc(n).inc
</xmp></font>
or
<font face="courier"><xmp>
class foo:
  def __init__(self, n):
      self.n = n
  def __call__(self, i):
      self.n += i
      return self.n
</xmp></font>
I include these because I wouldn't want Python
advocates to say I was misrepresenting the language,   
but both seem to me more complex than the first   
version.  You're doing the same thing, setting up
a separate place to hold the accumulator; it's just
a field in an object instead of the head of a list.
And the use of these special,
reserved field names, especially <tt>__call__</tt>, seems
a bit of a hack.<br><br>In the rivalry between Perl and Python, the claim of the
Python hackers seems to be that
that Python is a more elegant alternative to Perl, but what
this case shows is that power is the ultimate elegance:
the Perl program is simpler (has fewer elements), even if the
syntax is a bit uglier.<br><br>How about other languages? In the other languages
mentioned in this talk-- Fortran, C, C++, Java, and
Visual Basic-- it is not clear whether you can actually
solve this problem.
Ken Anderson says that the following code is about as close
as you can get in Java:
<font face="courier"><xmp>
public interface Inttoint {
  public int call(int i);
}
</xmp></font>
<font face="courier"><xmp>
public static Inttoint foo(final int n) {
  return new Inttoint() {
    int s = n;
    public int call(int i) {
    s = s + i;
    return s;
    }};
}
</xmp></font>
This falls short of the spec because it only works for
integers.  After many email exchanges with Java hackers,
I would say that writing a properly polymorphic version
that behaves like the preceding examples is somewhere
between damned awkward and impossible.  If anyone wants to
write one I'd be very curious to see it, but I personally
have timed out.<br><br>It's not literally true that you can't solve this
problem in other languages, of course.  The fact
that all these languages are Turing-equivalent means
that, strictly speaking, you can write any program in
any of them.  So how would you do it?  In the limit case,
by writing a Lisp
interpreter in the less powerful language.<br><br>That sounds like a joke, but it happens so often to
varying degrees in large programming projects that
there is a name for the phenomenon, Greenspun's Tenth
Rule:
<blockquote>
 Any sufficiently
     complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc
     informally-specified bug-ridden slow implementation of half of
     Common Lisp.
</blockquote>
If you try to solve a
hard problem, the question is not whether you will use
a powerful enough language, but whether you will (a)
use a powerful language, (b) write a de facto interpreter
for one, or (c) yourself become a human compiler for one.
We see this already
begining to happen in the Python example, where we are
in effect simulating the code that a compiler

I consider it a sign of trouble.  The shape of a program
should reflect only the problem it needs to solve.
Any other regularity in the code is a sign, to me at
least, that I'm using abstractions that aren't powerful

August 2002<br><br><i>(This article describes the spam-filtering techniques
used in the spamproof web-based mail reader we
built to exercise <a href="arc.html">Arc</a>. An
improved algorithm is described in <a href="better.html">Better
Bayesian Filtering</a>.)</i><br><br>I think it's possible to stop spam, and that 
content-based filters are the way to do it.
The Achilles heel of the spammers is their message.
They can circumvent any other barrier you set up.  They have so far, at
least.  But they have to deliver their message, whatever it
is.  If we can write software that recognizes their messages,
there is no way they can get around that.<br><br></p><center>_ _ _</center><br><br>To the recipient, spam is easily recognizable.  If you hired 
someone to read your mail and discard the spam, they would
have little trouble doing it.  How much do we have
to do, short of AI, to automate this process?<br><br>I think we will be able to solve the problem with fairly
simple algorithms.  In fact, I've found that you can filter
present-day spam acceptably well using nothing more than a
Bayesian combination of the spam probabilities of individual
words.  Using a slightly tweaked (as described below) Bayesian
filter, we now miss less than 5 per 1000 spams, with 0 false positives.<br><br>The statistical approach is not usually the first one people
try when they write spam filters.  Most hackers' first instinct is
to try to write software that recognizes individual properties of
spam.  You look at spams
and you think, the gall of these guys to try sending me mail 
that begins "Dear Friend" or has a subject line that's all
uppercase and ends in eight exclamation points.  I can filter
out that stuff with about one line of code.<br><br>And so you do,
and in the beginning it works.  A few simple rules will take
a big bite out of your incoming spam.  Merely looking
for the word "click" will catch 79.7% of the
emails in my spam corpus, with only 1.2% false positives.<br><br>I spent about six months writing software that looked for
individual spam features before I tried the statistical
approach.  What I found was that recognizing that last few
percent of spams got very hard, and that as I
made the filters stricter I got more false positives.<br><br>False positives are innocent emails that get mistakenly
identified as spams.
For most users,
missing legitimate email is
an order of magnitude worse than receiving spam, so a
filter that yields false positives is like an acne cure
that carries a risk of death to the patient.<br><br>The more spam a user gets, the less
likely he'll be to notice one innocent mail sitting in his
spam folder.  And strangely enough, the better your spam filters get,
the more dangerous false positives become, because when the
filters are really good, users will be more likely to
ignore everything they catch.<br><br>I don't know why I avoided trying the statistical approach
for so long.  I think it was because I got addicted to
trying to identify spam features myself, as if I were playing
some kind of competitive game with the spammers.  (Nonhackers
don't often realize this, but most hackers are very competitive.)
When I did try statistical analysis, I
found immediately that it was much cleverer than I had been.
It discovered, of course, that terms like "virtumundo" and
"teens" were good indicators of spam.  But it also
discovered that "per" and "FL" and "ff0000" are good 
indicators of spam.  In fact, "ff0000" (html for bright red)
turns out to be as good an indicator of spam as any  
pornographic term.<br><br><center>_ _ _</center><br><br>Here's a sketch of how I do statistical filtering.  I start
with one corpus of spam and one of nonspam mail.  At the
moment each one has about 4000 messages in it.  I scan
the entire text, including headers and embedded html
and javascript, of each message in each corpus.
I currently consider alphanumeric characters,
dashes, apostrophes, and dollar signs to be part of tokens,
and everything else to be a token separator.  (There is
probably room for improvement here.)  I ignore tokens that
are all digits, and I also ignore html comments, not even
considering them as token separators.<br><br>I count the number
of times each token (ignoring case, currently) occurs in
each corpus.  At this stage I end up with two large hash   
tables, one for each corpus, mapping tokens to number
of occurrences.<br><br>Next I create a third hash table, this time mapping
each token to the probability that an email containing it is a spam,
which I calculate as follows [1]:
<font face="courier" size="2"><xmp>
(let ((g (* 2 (or (gethash word good) 0)))
      (b (or (gethash word bad) 0)))
   (unless (< (+ g b) 5)
     (max .01
          (min .99 (float (/ (min 1 (/ b nbad))
                             (+ (min 1 (/ g ngood))   
                                (min 1 (/ b nbad)))))))))
</xmp></font>
where <font face="courier">word</font> is the token whose probability we're
calculating, <font face="courier">good</font> and <font face="courier">bad</font> are the hash tables
I created in the first step, and <font face="courier">ngood</font> and <font face="courier">nbad</font>
are the number of nonspam and spam messages respectively.<br><br>I explained this as code to show a couple of important details.
I want to bias the probabilities slightly to avoid false
positives, and by trial and error I've found that a good
way to do it is to double all the numbers in <font face="courier">good</font>.
This helps to distinguish between words that occasionally
do occur in legitimate email and words that almost never do. 
I only consider words that occur more than five times in
total (actually, because of the doubling, occurring three 
times in nonspam mail would be enough).  And then there is
the question of what probability to assign to words that
occur in one corpus but not the other.  Again by trial and   
error I chose .01 and .99.  There may be room for tuning
here, but as the corpus grows such tuning will happen
automatically anyway.<br><br>The especially observant will notice that while I consider
each corpus to be a single long stream of text for purposes
of counting occurrences, I use the number of emails in
each, rather than their combined length, as the divisor     
in calculating spam probabilities.  This adds another
slight bias to protect against false positives.<br><br>When new mail arrives, it is scanned into tokens, and
the most interesting fifteen tokens, where interesting is  
measured by how far their spam probability is from a
neutral .5, are used to calculate the probability that
the mail is spam.  If <font face="courier">probs</font>
is a list of the fifteen individual probabilities, you
calculate the 
<a href="naivebayes.html">combined</a> probability thus:
<font face="courier" size="2"><xmp>
(let ((prod (apply #'* probs)))
  (/ prod (+ prod (apply #'* (mapcar #'(lambda (x) 
                                         (- 1 x))
                                     probs)))))
</xmp></font>
One question that arises in
practice is what probability to assign to a word you've
never seen, i.e. one that doesn't occur in the hash table
of word probabilities.  I've found, again by trial and
error, that .4 is a good number to use.  If you've never
seen a word before, it is probably fairly innocent; spam
words tend to be all too familiar.<br><br>There are examples of this algorithm being applied to
actual emails in an appendix at the end.<br><br>I treat mail as spam if the algorithm above gives it a
probability of more than .9 of being spam.  But in practice
it would not matter much where I put this threshold, because
few probabilities end up in the middle of the range.<br><br><center>_ _ _</center><br><br>One great advantage of the statistical approach is that you
don't have to read so many spams.  Over the past six months,
I've read literally thousands of spams, and it is really
kind of demoralizing.  Norbert Wiener said if you compete
with slaves you become a slave, and there is something
similarly degrading about competing with spammers.   To
recognize individual spam features you have to try to get
into the mind of the spammer, and frankly I want to spend
as little time inside the minds of spammers as possible.<br><br>But the real advantage of the Bayesian approach, of course,
is that you know what
you're measuring.  Feature-recognizing filters like
SpamAssassin assign a spam "score" to email.  The Bayesian
approach assigns an actual probability.  The problem with
a "score" is that no one knows what it means.  The user
doesn't know what it means, but worse still, neither does
the developer of the filter.  How many <i>points</i> should an
email get for having the word "sex" in it?  A probability
can of course be mistaken, but there is little ambiguity
about what it means, or how evidence should be combined
to calculate it.  Based on my corpus, "sex" indicates
a .97 probability of the containing email being a spam,
whereas "sexy" indicates .99 probability.
And Bayes' Rule, equally unambiguous, says that an email
containing both words would, in the (unlikely)
absence of any other evidence, have a 99.97% chance of
being a spam.<br><br>Because it is measuring probabilities, the Bayesian approach
considers all the evidence in the email, both good and bad.
Words that occur disproportionately <i>rarely</i>
in spam (like "though" or "tonight" or "apparently")
contribute as much to decreasing the probability as
bad words like "unsubscribe" and "opt-in" do to
increasing it.  So an otherwise innocent email that happens
to include the word "sex" is not going to get tagged as spam.<br><br>Ideally, of course, the probabilities should be calculated
individually for each user.  I get a lot of email containing
the word "Lisp", and (so far) no spam that does.  So a word
like that is effectively a kind of password for sending
mail to me.  In my earlier spam-filtering software, the user
could set up a list of such words and mail containing
them would automatically get past the filters.  On my
list I put words like "Lisp" and also my zipcode, so
that (otherwise rather spammy-sounding) receipts from
online orders would get through.  I thought I was being
very clever, but I found that the Bayesian filter did the
same thing for me, and moreover discovered of a lot of words I
hadn't thought of.<br><br>When I said at the start that our filters let through less than
5 spams per 1000 with 0 false positives, I'm talking about
filtering my mail based on a corpus of my mail.  But these
numbers are not misleading, because that is the approach I'm
advocating: filter each user's mail based on the spam and
nonspam mail he receives.  Essentially, each user should
have two delete buttons, ordinary delete and delete-as-spam.
Anything deleted as spam goes into the spam corpus,   
and everything else goes into the nonspam corpus.<br><br>You could start
users with a seed filter, but ultimately each user should have
his own per-word probabilities based on the actual mail he
receives.  This (a) makes the filters more effective, (b) lets
each user decide their own precise definition of spam,
and (c) perhaps best of all makes it hard for spammers
to tune mails to get through the filters.  If a lot of the  
brain of the filter is in the individual databases, then 
merely tuning spams to get through the seed filters
won't guarantee anything about how well they'll get through
individual users' varying and much more trained filters.<br><br>Content-based spam filtering is often combined with a whitelist,
a list of senders whose mail can be accepted with no filtering.
One easy way to build such a
whitelist is to keep a list of every address the user has
ever sent mail to.  If a mail reader has a delete-as-spam
button then you could also add the from address
of every email the user has deleted as ordinary trash.<br><br>I'm an advocate of whitelists, but more as a way to save  
computation than as a way to improve filtering.  I used to think that
whitelists would make filtering easier, because you'd
only have to filter email from people you'd never heard
from, and someone sending you mail for the first time is
constrained by convention in what they can say to you.
Someone you already know might send you an email talking about sex,
but someone sending you mail for the first time would not   
be likely to.  The problem is, people can have more than one 
email address, so a new from-address doesn't guarantee that
the sender is writing to you for the first time.
It is not unusual
for an old friend (especially if he is a hacker) to suddenly
send you an email with a new from-address, so you can't
risk false positives by filtering mail from unknown  
addresses especially stringently.<br><br>In a sense, though, my filters do themselves embody a kind
of whitelist (and blacklist) because they are based on
entire messages, including the headers.  So to that
extent they "know" the email addresses of trusted senders
and even the routes by which mail gets from them to me.   
And they know the same about spam, including the server   
names, mailer versions, and protocols.<br><br><center>_ _ _</center><br><br>If I thought that I could keep up current rates of spam
filtering, I would consider this problem solved.  But it
doesn't mean much to be able to filter out most present-day
spam, because spam evolves.
Indeed, most 
<a href="falsepositives.html">antispam techniques</a> so far have been like pesticides that
do nothing more than create a new, resistant strain of bugs.<br><br>I'm more hopeful about Bayesian filters, because they evolve
with the spam.  So as spammers start using "c0ck"   
instead of "cock" to evade simple-minded spam filters     
based on individual words, Bayesian filters automatically
notice.  Indeed, "c0ck" is far more damning evidence than
"cock", and Bayesian filters know precisely how much more.<br><br>Still, anyone who proposes a plan for spam filtering has to
be able to answer the question: if the spammers knew
exactly what you were doing,
how well could they get past you?  For example, I think that if
checksum-based spam filtering becomes a serious obstacle,
the spammers will just
switch to mad-lib techniques for generating message bodies.<br><br>To beat Bayesian filters, it would not be enough for spammers
to make their emails unique or to stop using individual
naughty words.  They'd have to make their mails indistinguishable
from your ordinary mail.  And this I think would severely
constrain them.  Spam is mostly sales
pitches, so unless your regular mail is all sales pitches,
spams will inevitably have a different character.  And    
the spammers would also, of course, have to change (and keep 
changing) their whole infrastructure, because otherwise
the headers would look as bad to the Bayesian filters as ever,
no matter what they did to the message body.  I don't know
enough about the infrastructure that spammers use to know
how hard it would be to make the headers look innocent, but
my guess is that it would be even harder than making the    
message look innocent.<br><br>Assuming they could solve the problem of the headers,
the spam of the future will probably look something like
this:
<font face="courier"><xmp>
Hey there.  Thought you should check out the following:
http://www.27meg.com/foo
</xmp></font>
because that is about as much sales pitch as content-based
filtering will leave the spammer room to make.  (Indeed, it
will be hard even to get this past filters, because if everything
else in the email is neutral, the spam probability will hinge on
the url, and it will take some effort to make that look neutral.)<br><br>Spammers range from businesses running so-called
opt-in lists who don't even try to conceal their identities,
to guys who hijack mail servers to send out spams promoting
porn sites.  If we use filtering to whittle their
options down to mails like the one above, that should
pretty much put the spammers on the "legitimate" end of
the spectrum out of business; they feel obliged
by various state laws to include boilerplate about why
their spam is not spam, and how to cancel your
"subscription,"  and that kind of text is easy to   
recognize.<br><br>(I used to think it was naive to believe that stricter laws
would decrease spam.  Now I think that while stricter laws  
may not decrease the amount of spam that spammers <i>send,</i>
they can certainly help filters to decrease the amount of  
spam that recipients actually see.)<br><br>All along the spectrum, if you restrict the sales pitches spammers
can make, you will inevitably tend to put them out of
business.  That word <i>business</i> is an important one to
remember.  The spammers are businessmen.  They send spam because
it works.  It works because although the response rate
is abominably low (at best 15 per million, vs 3000 per
million for a catalog mailing), the cost, to them, is  
practically nothing.  The cost is enormous for the recipients,   
about 5 man-weeks for each million recipients who spend  
a second to delete the spam, but the spammer
doesn't have to pay that.<br><br>Sending spam does cost the spammer something, though. [2]
So the lower we can get the
response rate-- whether by filtering, or by using filters to force
spammers to dilute their pitches-- the fewer businesses will find it
worth their while to send spam.<br><br>The reason the spammers use the kinds of 
<a href="http://www.milliondollaremails.com">sales
pitches</a> that they do is to increase response rates.
This is possibly even more disgusting
than getting inside the mind of a spammer,
but let's take a quick look inside the mind of someone
who <i>responds</i> to a spam.  This person is either
astonishingly credulous or deeply in denial about their   
sexual interests.  In either case, repulsive or
idiotic as the spam seems to us, it is exciting
to them.  The spammers wouldn't say these things if they
didn't sound exciting.  And "thought you
should check out the following" is just not going to
have nearly the pull with the spam recipient as
the kinds of things that spammers say now.
Result: if it can't contain exciting sales pitches,
spam becomes less effective as a marketing vehicle,
and fewer businesses want to use it.<br><br>That is the big win in the end.  I started writing spam
filtering software because I didn't want have to look at
the stuff anymore.
But if we get good enough at filtering
out spam, it will stop working, and the spammers
will actually stop sending it.<br><br><center>_ _ _</center><br><br>Of all the approaches to fighting spam, from software to laws,
I believe Bayesian filtering will be the single most
effective.  But I also
think that the more different kinds of antispam efforts
we undertake, the better, because any measure that
constrains spammers will tend to make filtering easier.
And even within the world of content-based filtering, I think
it will be a good thing if there are many different kinds
of software being used simultaneously.  The more different 
filters there are, the harder it will be for
spammers to tune spams to get through them.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Appendix: Examples of Filtering</b><br><br><a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/spam1.txt?t=1688221954&amp;" target="txtwin">Here</a> is an example of a spam that arrived while I was writing
this article.  The fifteen most interesting words in this spam are:
<font face="courier"><xmp>

freeyankeedom
cdo

platinum

The words are a mix of stuff from the headers and from the
message body, which is typical of spam.  Also typical of spam
is that every one of these words has a spam probability,
in my database, of .99.  In fact there are more than fifteen words
with probabilities of .99, and these are just the first
fifteen seen.<br><br>Unfortunately that makes this email a boring example of
the use of Bayes' Rule.  To see an interesting variety of
probabilities we have to look at <a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/spam2.txt?t=1688221954&amp;" target="txtwin">this</a> actually quite
atypical spam.<br><br>The fifteen most interesting words in this spam, with their probabilities,
are:
<font face="courier"><xmp>

republic        0.99

This time the evidence is a mix of good and bad.  A word like  
"shortest" is almost as much evidence for innocence as a
word like "madam" or "promotion" is for guilt.  But still the
case for guilt is stronger.  If you combine these numbers
according to Bayes' Rule, the resulting probability is .9027.<br><br>"Madam" is obviously from spams beginning
"Dear Sir or Madam."  They're not very common, but the
word "madam" <i>never</i> occurs in my legitimate email, and
it's all about the ratio.<br><br>"Republic" scores high because
it often shows up in Nigerian scam emails, and also occurs once
or twice in spams referring to Korea and South Africa.
You might say that it's
an accident that it thus helps identify this spam.  But I've
found when examining spam probabilities that there are
a lot of these accidents, and they have an uncanny tendency to
push things in the right direction rather than the wrong one.
In this case, it is not entirely a coincidence that the word
"Republic" occurs in Nigerian scam emails and this spam.
There is a whole class of dubious business propositions involving
less developed countries, and these in turn are more likely
to have names that specify explicitly (because they aren't) that they
are republics.[3]<br><br>On the other hand, "enter" is a genuine miss.  It occurs
mostly in unsubscribe instructions, but here is used in a
completely innocent way.  Fortunately the statistical approach is
fairly robust, and can tolerate quite a lot of misses
before the results start to be thrown off.<br><br>For comparison, 
<a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/hostexspam.txt?t=1688221954&amp;" target="txtwin">here</a> is an example of that rare bird, a spam that
gets through the filters.  Why?  Because by sheer chance it happens
to be loaded with words that occur in my actual email:

There are a couple pieces of good news here.  First, this mail
probably wouldn't get through the filters of someone who didn't
happen to specialize in programming languages and have a good
friend called Morris.  For the average user, all the top five words here 
would be neutral and would not contribute to the spam probability.<br><br>Second, I think filtering based on word pairs 
(see below) might well
catch this one:  "cost effective", "setup fee", "money back" -- pretty
incriminating stuff.  And of course if they continued to spam me
(or a network I was part of), "Hostex" itself would be
recognized as  a spam term.<br><br>Finally, <a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/legit.txt?t=1688221954&amp;" target="txtwin">here</a> is an innocent email.
Its  fifteen most interesting words are as follows:
<font face="courier"><xmp>

</xmp></font>
Most of the words here indicate the mail is an innocent one.
There are two bad smelling words,  "color"
(spammers love colored fonts) and "California"
(which occurs in testimonials and also in menus in
forms), but they are not enough to outweigh obviously
innocent words like "continuation" and "example".<br><br>It's interesting that "describe" rates as so thoroughly
innocent.  It hasn't occurred in a
single one of my 4000 spams.  The data turns out to be
full of such surprises.  One of the things you learn
when you analyze spam texts is how
narrow a subset of the language spammers operate in.  It's
that fact, together with the equally characteristic vocabulary
of any individual user's mail, that makes Bayesian filtering
a good bet.<br><br><b>Appendix: More Ideas</b><br><br>One idea that I haven't tried yet is to filter based on
word pairs, or even triples, rather than individual words.
This should yield a much sharper estimate of the probability.
For example, in my current database, the word "offers"
has a probability of .96.  If you based the probabilities  
on word pairs, you'd end up with "special offers"
and "valuable offers" having probabilities of .99
and, say, "approach offers" (as in "this approach offers")
having a probability of .1 or less.<br><br>The reason I haven't done this is that filtering based on
individual words already works so well.  But it does
mean that there is room to tighten the filters if spam
gets harder to detect.
(Curiously, a filter based on word pairs would be
in effect a Markov-chaining text generator running
in reverse.)<br><br>Specific spam features (e.g. not seeing the recipient's
address in the to: field) do of course have value in 
recognizing spam.  They can be considered in this
algorithm by treating them as virtual words.  I'll probably
do this in future versions, at least for a handful of the
most egregious spam indicators. Feature-recognizing
spam filters are right in many details; what they lack
is an overall discipline for combining evidence.<br><br>Recognizing nonspam features may be more important than
recognizing spam features.  False positives are such a
worry that they demand extraordinary measures.  I will
probably in future versions add a second level of testing
designed specifically to avoid false positives.  If a
mail triggers this second level of filters it will be accepted
even if its spam probability is above the threshold.<br><br>I don't expect this second level of filtering to be Bayesian.
It will inevitably 
be not only ad hoc, but based on guesses, because the number of
false positives will not tend to be large enough to notice patterns.
(It is just as well, anyway, if a backup system doesn't rely on the same
technology as the primary system.)<br><br>Another thing I may try in the future is to focus extra attention
on specific parts of the email.  For example, about 95% of current
spam includes the url of a site they want
you to visit.  (The remaining 5% want you to call a phone number,
reply by email or to a US mail address, or in a few
cases to buy a certain stock.)   The url is in such cases
practically enough by itself to determine whether the email
is spam.<br><br>Domain names differ from the rest of the text in
a (non-German) email in that they often consist of several
words stuck together.  Though computationally expensive 
in the general case, it might be worth trying to 
decompose them.  If a filter has never seen the
token "xxxporn" before it will have an individual spam
probability of .4, whereas "xxx" and "porn" individually
have probabilities (in my corpus) of .9889 and .99
respectively, and a combined probability of .9998.<br><br>I expect decomposing domain names to become more
important as spammers are gradually forced to stop using
incriminating words in the text of their messages.  (A url
with an ip address is of course an extremely incriminating sign,
except in the mail of a few sysadmins.)<br><br>It might be a good idea to have a cooperatively maintained
list of urls promoted by spammers.  We'd need a trust metric
of the type studied by Raph Levien to prevent malicious
or incompetent submissions, but if we had such a thing it
would provide a boost to any filtering software.   It would
also be a convenient basis for boycotts.<br><br>Another way to test dubious urls would be to send out a
crawler to look at the site before the user looked at the
email mentioning it.  You could use a Bayesian filter to
rate the site just as you would an email, and whatever
was found on the site could be included in calculating
the probability of the email being a spam.  A url that led
to a redirect would of course be especially suspicious.<br><br>One cooperative project that I think really would be a good
idea would be to accumulate a giant corpus of spam.  A large,
clean corpus is the key to making Bayesian filtering work
well.  Bayesian filters could actually use the corpus as
input.  But such a corpus would be useful for other kinds
of filters too, because it could be used to test them.<br><br>Creating such a corpus poses some technical problems.  We'd
need trust metrics to prevent malicious or incompetent
submissions, of course.  We'd also need ways of erasing   
personal information (not just to-addresses and ccs, but
also e.g. the arguments to unsubscribe urls, which often
encode the to-address) from mails in the corpus.  If anyone
wants to take on this project, it would be a good thing for
the world.<br><br><b>Appendix: Defining Spam</b><br><br>I think there is a rough
consensus on what spam is, but it would be useful to have
an explicit definition.  We'll need to do this if we want to establish
a central corpus of spam, or even to compare spam filtering
rates meaningfully.<br><br>To start with, spam is not unsolicited commercial email.
If someone in my neighborhood heard that I was looking for an old
Raleigh three-speed in good condition, and sent me an email
offering to sell me one, I'd be delighted, and yet this
email would be both commercial and unsolicited.  The
defining feature of spam (in fact, its <i>raison d'etre</i>)
is not that it is unsolicited, but that it is automated.<br><br>It is merely incidental, too, that spam is usually commercial.
If someone started sending mass email to support some political
cause, for example, it would be just as much spam as email
promoting a porn site.<br><br>I propose we define spam as <b>unsolicited automated email</b>.
This definition thus includes some email
that many legal definitions of spam don't.  Legal definitions
of spam, influenced presumably by lobbyists, tend to exclude
mail sent by companies that have an "existing relationship" with
the recipient.  But buying something from a company, for
example, does not imply that you have solicited
ongoing email from them.
If I order something from an online
store, and they then send me a stream of spam, it's still
spam.<br><br>Companies sending spam often give you a way to "unsubscribe,"
or ask you to go to their site and change your "account
preferences" if you want to stop getting spam.  This is
not enough to stop the mail from being spam.  Not opting out
is not the same as opting in.  Unless the   
recipient explicitly checked a clearly labelled box (whose
default was no) asking to receive the email, then it is spam.<br><br>In some business relationships, you do implicitly solicit
certain kinds of mail.   When you order online, I think you
implicitly solicit a receipt, and notification when the
order ships.
I don't mind when Verisign sends me mail warning that
a domain name is about to expire (at least, if they are the
<a href="http://siliconvalley.internet.com/news/article.php/1441651">actual 
registrar</a> for it).  But when Verisign sends me
email offering a FREE Guide to Building My
E-Commerce Web Site, that's spam.<br><br>
<b>Notes:</b><br><br>[1] The examples in this article are translated
into Common Lisp for, believe it or not, greater accessibility.
The application described here is one that we wrote in order to
test a new Lisp dialect called <a href="arc.html">Arc</a> that is 
not yet released.<br><br>[2] Currently the lowest rate seems to be about $200 to send a million spams.
That's very cheap, 1/50th of a cent per spam.
But filtering out 95%
of spam, for example, would increase the spammers' cost to reach
a given audience by a factor of 20.  Few can have
margins big enough to absorb that.<br><br>[3] As a rule of thumb, the more qualifiers there are before the

of NEPLS.)</i><br><br>Visitors to this country are often surprised to find that
Americans like to begin a conversation by asking "what do you do?"
I've never liked this question.  I've rarely had a
neat answer to it.  But I think I have finally solved the problem.
Now, when someone asks me what I do, I look them straight
in the eye and say "I'm designing a 
<a href="arc.html">new dialect of Lisp</a>."   
I recommend this answer to anyone who doesn't like being asked what
they do.  The conversation will turn immediately to other topics.<br><br>I don't consider myself to be doing research on programming languages.
I'm just designing one, in the same way that someone might design
a building or a chair or a new typeface.
I'm not trying to discover anything new.  I just want
to make a language that will be good to program in.  In some ways,
this assumption makes life a lot easier.<br><br>The difference between design and research seems to be a question
of new versus good.  Design doesn't have to be new, but it has to  
be good.  Research doesn't have to be good, but it has to be new.
I think these two paths converge at the top: the best design
surpasses its predecessors by using new ideas, and the best research
solves problems that are not only new, but actually worth solving.
So ultimately we're aiming for the same destination, just approaching
it from different directions.<br><br>What I'm going to talk about today is what your target looks like
from the back.  What do you do differently when you treat
programming languages as a design problem instead of a research topic?<br><br><br><br>The biggest difference is that you focus more on the user.
Design begins by asking, who is this
for and what do they need from it?  A good architect,
for example, does not begin by creating a design that he then
imposes on the users, but by studying the intended users and figuring
out what they need.<br><br>Notice I said "what they need," not "what they want."  I don't mean
to give the impression that working as a designer means working as 
a sort of short-order cook, making whatever the client tells you
to.  This varies from field to field in the arts, but
I don't think there is any field in which the best work is done by
the people who just make exactly what the customers tell them to.<br><br>The customer <i>is</i> always right in
the sense that the measure of good design is how well it works
for the user.  If you make a novel that bores everyone, or a chair
that's horribly uncomfortable to sit in, then you've done a bad
job, period.  It's no defense to say that the novel or the chair  
is designed according to the most advanced theoretical principles.<br><br>And yet, making what works for the user doesn't mean simply making
what the user tells you to.  Users don't know what all the choices
are, and are often mistaken about what they really want.<br><br>The answer to the paradox, I think, is that you have to design
for the user, but you have to design what the user needs, not simply  
what he says he wants.
It's much like being a doctor.  You can't just treat a patient's
symptoms.  When a patient tells you his symptoms, you have to figure
out what's actually wrong with him, and treat that.<br><br>This focus on the user is a kind of axiom from which most of the
practice of good design can be derived, and around which most design
issues center.<br><br><br><br>If good design must do what the user needs, who is the user?  When
I say that design must be for users, I don't mean to imply that good 
design aims at some kind of  
lowest common denominator.  You can pick any group of users you
want.  If you're designing a tool, for example, you can design it
for anyone from beginners to experts, and what's good design
for one group might be bad for another.  The point
is, you have to pick some group of users.  I don't think you can
even talk about good or bad design except with
reference to some intended user.<br><br>You're most likely to get good design if the intended users include
the designer himself.  When you design something
for a group that doesn't include you, it tends to be for people
you consider to be less sophisticated than you, not more sophisticated.<br><br>That's a problem, because looking down on the user, however benevolently,
seems inevitably to corrupt the designer.
I suspect that very few housing
projects in the US were designed by architects who expected to live
in them.   You can see the same thing
in programming languages.  C, Lisp, and Smalltalk were created for
their own designers to use.  Cobol, Ada, and Java, were created   
for other people to use.<br><br>If you think you're designing something for idiots, the odds are
that you're not designing something good, even for idiots.<br><br><br><br>
Even if you're designing something for the most sophisticated
users, though, you're still designing for humans.  It's different 
in research.  In math you
don't choose abstractions because they're
easy for humans to understand; you choose whichever make the
proof shorter.  I think this is true for the sciences generally.
Scientific ideas are not meant to be ergonomic.<br><br>Over in the arts, things are very different.  Design is
all about people.  The human body is a strange
thing, but when you're designing a chair,
that's what you're designing for, and there's no way around it.
All the arts have to pander to the interests and limitations
of humans.   In painting, for example, all other things being
equal a painting with people in it will be more interesting than
one without.  It is not merely an accident of history that
the great paintings of the Renaissance are all full of people.
If they hadn't been, painting as a medium wouldn't have the prestige
that it does.<br><br>Like it or not, programming languages are also for people,
and I suspect the human brain is just as lumpy and idiosyncratic
as the human body.  Some ideas are easy for people to grasp
and some aren't.  For example, we seem to have a very limited
capacity for dealing with detail.  It's this fact that makes
programing languages a good idea in the first place; if we
could handle the detail, we could just program in machine
language.<br><br>Remember, too, that languages are not
primarily a form for finished programs, but something that
programs have to be developed in.  Anyone in the arts could
tell you that you might want different mediums for the
two situations.  Marble, for example, is a nice, durable
medium for finished ideas, but a hopelessly inflexible one
for developing new ideas.<br><br>A program, like a proof,
is a pruned version of a tree that in the past has had
false starts branching off all over it.  So the test of
a language is not simply how clean the finished program looks
in it, but how clean the path to the finished program was.
A design choice that gives you elegant finished programs
may not give you an elegant design process.  For example, 
I've written a few macro-defining macros full of nested
backquotes that look now like little gems, but writing them
took hours of the ugliest trial and error, and frankly, I'm still
not entirely sure they're correct.<br><br>We often act as if the test of a language were how good
finished programs look in it.
It seems so convincing when you see the same program
written in two languages, and one version is much shorter.
When you approach the problem from the direction of the
arts, you're less likely to depend on this sort of
test.  You don't want to end up with a programming
language like marble.<br><br>For example, it is a huge win in developing software to
have an interactive toplevel, what in Lisp is called a
read-eval-print loop.  And when you have one this has
real effects on the design of the language.  It would not
work well for a language where you have to declare
variables before using them, for example.  When you're
just typing expressions into the toplevel, you want to be 
able to set x to some value and then start doing things
to x.  You don't want to have to declare the type of x
first.  You may dispute either of the premises, but if
a language has to have a toplevel to be convenient, and
mandatory type declarations are incompatible with a
toplevel, then no language that makes type declarations  
mandatory could be convenient to program in.<br><br><br><br>In practice, to get good design you have to get close, and stay
close, to your users.  You have to calibrate your ideas on actual
users constantly, especially in the beginning.  One of the reasons
Jane Austen's novels are so good is that she read them out loud to
her family.  That's why she never sinks into self-indulgently arty
descriptions of landscapes,
or pretentious philosophizing.  (The philosophy's there, but it's
woven into the story instead of being pasted onto it like a label.)
If you open an average "literary" novel and imagine reading it out loud
to your friends as something you'd written, you'll feel all too
keenly what an imposition that kind of thing is upon the reader.<br><br>In the software world, this idea is known as Worse is Better.
Actually, there are several ideas mixed together in the concept of
Worse is Better, which is why people are still arguing about
whether worse
is actually better or not.  But one of the main ideas in that
mix is that if you're building something new, you should get a
prototype in front of users as soon as possible.<br><br>The alternative approach might be called the Hail Mary strategy.
Instead of getting a prototype out quickly and gradually refining
it, you try to create the complete, finished, product in one long
touchdown pass.  As far as I know, this is a
recipe for disaster.  Countless startups destroyed themselves this
way during the Internet bubble.  I've never heard of a case
where it worked.<br><br>What people outside the software world may not realize is that
Worse is Better is found throughout the arts.
In drawing, for example, the idea was discovered during the
Renaissance.  Now almost every drawing teacher will tell you that
the right way to get an accurate drawing is not to
work your way slowly around the contour of an object, because errors will
accumulate and you'll find at the end that the lines don't meet.
Instead you should draw a few quick lines in roughly the right place,
and then gradually refine this initial sketch.<br><br>In most fields, prototypes
have traditionally been made out of different materials.
Typefaces to be cut in metal were initially designed  
with a brush on paper.  Statues to be cast in bronze   
were modelled in wax.  Patterns to be embroidered on tapestries
were drawn on paper with ink wash.  Buildings to be
constructed from stone were tested on a smaller scale in wood.<br><br>What made oil paint so exciting, when it
first became popular in the fifteenth century, was that you
could actually make the finished work <i>from</i> the prototype.
You could make a preliminary drawing if you wanted to, but you
weren't held to it; you could work out all the details, and
even make major changes, as you finished the painting.<br><br>You can do this in software too.  A prototype doesn't have to
be just a model; you can refine it into the finished product.
I think you should always do this when you can.  It lets you
take advantage of new insights you have along the way.  But
perhaps even more important, it's good for morale.<br><br><br><br>Morale is key in design.  I'm surprised people
don't talk more about it.  One of my first
drawing teachers told me: if you're bored when you're
drawing something, the drawing will look boring.
For example, suppose you have to draw a building, and you
decide to draw each brick individually.  You can do this
if you want, but if you get bored halfway through and start
making the bricks mechanically instead of observing each one,   
the drawing will look worse than if you had merely suggested
the bricks.<br><br>Building something by gradually refining a prototype is good
for morale because it keeps you engaged.  In software, my  
rule is: always have working code.  If you're writing
something that you'll be able to test in an hour, then you
have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you.
The same is true in the arts, and particularly in oil painting.
Most painters start with a blurry sketch and gradually
refine it.
If you work this way, then in principle
you never have to end the day with something that actually
looks unfinished.  Indeed, there is even a saying among
painters: "A painting is never finished, you just stop
working on it."  This idea will be familiar to anyone who
has worked on software.<br><br>Morale is another reason that it's hard to design something
for an unsophisticated user.   It's hard to stay interested in
something you don't like yourself.  To make something  
good, you have to be thinking, "wow, this is really great,"
not "what a piece of shit; those fools will love it."<br><br>Design means making things for humans.  But it's not just the
user who's human.  The designer is human too.<br><br><br><br>Notice all this time I've been talking about "the designer."
Design usually has to be under the control of a single person to
be any good.   And yet it seems to be possible for several people
to collaborate on a research project.  This seems to
me one of the most interesting differences between research and
design.<br><br>There have been famous instances of collaboration in the arts,
but most of them seem to have been cases of molecular bonding rather
than nuclear fusion.  In an opera it's common for one person to
write the libretto and another to write the music.   And during the Renaissance, 
journeymen from northern
Europe were often employed to do the landscapes in the
backgrounds of Italian paintings.  But these aren't true collaborations.
They're more like examples of Robert Frost's
"good fences make good neighbors."  You can stick instances
of good design together, but within each individual project,
one person has to be in control.<br><br>I'm not saying that good design requires that one person think
of everything.  There's nothing more valuable than the advice
of someone whose judgement you trust.  But after the talking is
done, the decision about what to do has to rest with one person.<br><br>Why is it that research can be done by collaborators and  
design can't?  This is an interesting question.  I don't 
know the answer.  Perhaps,
if design and research converge, the best research is also
good design, and in fact can't be done by collaborators.
A lot of the most famous scientists seem to have worked alone.
But I don't know enough to say whether there
is a pattern here.  It could be simply that many famous scientists
worked when collaboration was less common.<br><br>Whatever the story is in the sciences, true collaboration
seems to be vanishingly rare in the arts.  Design by committee is a
synonym for bad design.  Why is that so?  Is there some way to
beat this limitation?<br><br>I'm inclined to think there isn't-- that good design requires
a dictator.  One reason is that good design has to   
be all of a piece.  Design is not just for humans, but

It describes the work I've done to improve the performance of
the algorithm described in <a href="spam.html">A Plan for Spam</a>,
and what I plan to do in the future.)</i><br><br>The first discovery I'd like to present here is an algorithm for
lazy evaluation of research papers.  Just
write whatever you want and don't cite any previous work, and
indignant readers will send you references to all the papers you
should have cited.   I discovered this algorithm
after ``A Plan for Spam'' [1] was on Slashdot.<br><br>Spam filtering is a subset of text classification,
which is a well established field, but the first papers about
Bayesian
spam filtering per se seem to have been two
given at the same conference in 1998,
one by Pantel and Lin [2],
and another by a group from
Microsoft Research [3].<br><br>When I heard about this work I was a bit surprised.  If
people had been onto Bayesian filtering four years ago,
why wasn't everyone using it?
When I read the papers I found out why.  Pantel and Lin's filter was the
more effective of the two, but it
only caught 92% of spam, with 1.16% false positives.<br><br>When I tried writing a Bayesian spam filter,
it caught 99.5% of spam with less than .03% false
positives [4].
It's always alarming when two people
trying the same experiment get widely divergent results.
It's especially alarming here because those two sets of numbers
might yield opposite conclusions.
Different users have different requirements, but I think for
many people a filtering rate of 92% with 1.16% false positives means
that filtering is not an acceptable solution, whereas
99.5% with less than .03% false positives means that it is.<br><br>So why did we get such different numbers?
I haven't tried to reproduce Pantel and Lin's results, but
from reading the paper I see five things that probably account
for the difference.<br><br>One is simply that they trained their filter on very little
data: 160 spam and 466 nonspam mails.
Filter performance should still be climbing with data
sets that small.  So their numbers may not even be an accurate
measure of the performance of their algorithm, let alone of
Bayesian spam filtering in general.<br><br>But I think the most important difference is probably
that they ignored message headers.  To anyone who has worked
on spam filters, this will seem a perverse decision.
And yet in the very first filters I tried writing, I ignored the
headers too.  Why?  Because I wanted to keep the problem neat.
I didn't know much about mail headers then, and they seemed to me
full of random stuff.  There is a lesson here for filter
writers: don't ignore data.  You'd think this lesson would
be too obvious to mention, but I've had to learn it several times.<br><br>Third, Pantel and Lin stemmed the tokens, meaning they reduced e.g. both
``mailing'' and ``mailed'' to the root ``mail''.   They may
have felt they were forced to do this by the small size
of their corpus, but if so this is a kind of premature 
optimization.<br><br>Fourth, they calculated probabilities differently.
They used all the tokens, whereas I only
use the 15 most significant.  If you use all the tokens
you'll tend to miss longer spams, the type where someone tells you their life
story up to the point where they got rich from some multilevel
marketing scheme.  And such an algorithm
would be easy for spammers to spoof: just add a big
chunk of random text to counterbalance the spam terms.<br><br>Finally, they didn't bias against false positives.
I think
any spam filtering algorithm ought to have a convenient
knob you can twist to decrease the
false positive rate at the expense of the filtering rate.
I do this by counting the occurrences
of tokens in the nonspam corpus double.  
<!--ref to Woodhead's graphs--><br><br>I don't think it's a good idea to treat spam filtering as
a straight text classification problem.  You can use
text classification techniques, but solutions can and should
reflect the fact that the text is email, and spam
in particular.  Email is not just text; it has structure.
Spam filtering is not just classification, because
false positives are so much worse than false negatives
that you should treat them as a different kind of error.
And the source of error is not just random variation, but
a live human spammer working actively to defeat your filter.<br><br><b>Tokens</b><br><br>Another project I heard about
after the Slashdot article was Bill Yerazunis' 
<a href="http://crm114.sourceforge.net">CRM114</a> [5].
This is the counterexample to the design principle I
just mentioned.  It's a straight text classifier,
but such a stunningly effective one that it manages to filter
spam almost perfectly without even knowing that's
what it's doing.<br><br>Once I understood how CRM114 worked, it seemed
inevitable that I would eventually have to move from filtering based
on single words to an approach like this.  But first, I thought,
I'll see how far I can get with single words.  And the answer is,
surprisingly far.<br><br>Mostly I've been working on smarter tokenization.  On
current spam, I've been able to achieve filtering rates that
approach CRM114's.  These techniques are mostly orthogonal to Bill's;
an optimal solution might incorporate both.<br><br>``A Plan for Spam'' uses a very simple
definition of a token.  Letters, digits, dashes, apostrophes,
and dollar signs are constituent characters, and everything
else is a token separator.  I also ignored case.<br><br>Now I have a more complicated definition of a token:
<ol>
<li> Case is preserved.<br><br></li><li> Exclamation points are constituent characters.<br><br></li><li> Periods and commas are constituents if they occur
 between two digits.  This lets me get ip addresses
 and prices intact.<br><br></li><li> A price range like $20-25 yields two tokens,
 $20 and $25.<br><br></li><li> Tokens that occur within the
 To, From, Subject, and Return-Path lines, or within urls,
 get marked accordingly.  E.g. ``foo'' in the Subject line
 becomes ``Subject*foo''.  (The asterisk could
 be any character you don't allow as a constituent.)
</li></ol>
Such measures increase the filter's vocabulary, which
makes it more discriminating.  For example, in the current
filter, ``free'' in the Subject line
has a spam probability of 98%, whereas the same token
in the body has a spam probability of only 65%.<br><br>Here are some of the current probabilities [6]:<br><br><font face="courier"><pre>Subject*FREE      0.9999
free!!            0.9999
To*free           0.9998
Subject*free      0.9782
free!             0.9199
Free              0.9198
Url*free          0.9091
FREE              0.8747
From*free         0.7636
free              0.6546
</pre></font>
In the Plan for Spam filter, all these tokens would have had the
same probability, .7602.  That filter recognized about 23,000
tokens.  The current one recognizes about 187,000.<br><br>The disadvantage of having a larger universe of tokens
is that there is more
chance of misses.
Spreading your corpus out over more tokens
has the same effect as making it smaller.
If you consider exclamation points as
constituents, for example, then you could end up
not having a spam probability for free with seven exclamation
points, even though you know that free with just two   
exclamation points has a probability of 99.99%.<br><br>One solution to this is what I call degeneration.  If you
can't find an exact match for a token,
treat it as if it were a less specific
version.  I consider terminal exclamation
points, uppercase letters, and occurring in one of the
five marked contexts as making a token more specific.
For example, if I don't find a probability for
``Subject*free!'', I look for probabilities for
``Subject*free'', ``free!'', and ``free'', and take whichever one
is farthest from .5.<br><br>Here are the alternatives [7]
considered if the filter sees ``FREE!!!'' in the
Subject line and doesn't have a probability for it.<br><br><font face="courier"><pre>Subject*Free!!!
Subject*free!!!
Subject*FREE!
Subject*Free!
Subject*free!
Subject*FREE
Subject*Free
Subject*free
FREE!!!
Free!!!
free!!!
FREE!
Free!
free!
FREE
Free
free              
</pre></font>
If you do this, be sure to consider versions with initial
caps as well as all uppercase and all lowercase.  Spams
tend to have more sentences in imperative mood, and in
those the first word is a verb.  So verbs with initial caps
have higher spam probabilities than they would in all 
lowercase.  In my filter, the spam probability of ``Act''
is 98% and for ``act'' only 62%.<br><br>If you increase your filter's vocabulary, you can end up
counting the same word multiple times, according to your old
definition of ``same''.
Logically, they're not the
same token anymore.  But if this still bothers you, let
me add from experience that the words you seem to be
counting multiple times tend to be exactly the ones you'd
want to.<br><br>Another effect of a larger vocabulary is that when you
look at an incoming mail you find more interesting tokens,
meaning those with probabilities far from .5.  I use the
15 most interesting to decide if mail is spam.
But you can run into a problem when you use a fixed number
like this.  If you find a lot of maximally interesting tokens,
the result can end up being decided by whatever random factor
determines the ordering of equally interesting tokens.
One way to deal with this is to treat some
as more interesting than others.<br><br>For example, the
token ``dalco'' occurs 3 times in my spam corpus and never
in my legitimate corpus.  The token ``Url*optmails''
(meaning ``optmails'' within a url) occurs 1223 times.
And yet, as I used to calculate probabilities for tokens,
both would have the same spam probability, the threshold of .99.<br><br>That doesn't feel right.  There are theoretical
arguments for giving these two tokens substantially different
probabilities (Pantel and Lin do), but I haven't tried that yet.
It does seem at least that if we find more than 15 tokens
that only occur in one corpus or the other, we ought to
give priority to the ones that occur a lot.  So now
there are two threshold values.  For tokens that occur only
in the spam corpus, the probability is .9999 if they
occur more than 10 times and .9998 otherwise.  Ditto
at the other end of the scale for tokens found
only in the legitimate corpus.<br><br>I may later scale token probabilities substantially,
but this tiny amount of scaling at least ensures that 
tokens get sorted the right way.<br><br>Another possibility would be to consider not
just 15 tokens, but all the tokens over a certain
threshold of interestingness.  Steven Hauser does this
in his statistical spam filter [8].
If you use a threshold, make it very high, or
spammers could spoof you by packing messages with
more innocent words.<br><br>Finally, what should one do
about html?  I've tried the whole spectrum of options, from
ignoring it to parsing it all.  Ignoring html is a bad idea,
because it's full of useful spam signs.  But if you parse 
it all, your filter might degenerate into a mere html   
recognizer.  The most effective approach
seems to be the middle course, to notice some tokens but not
others.  I look at a, img, and font tags, and ignore the
rest.  Links and images you should certainly look at, because
they contain urls.<br><br>I could probably be smarter about dealing with html, but I
don't think it's worth putting a lot of time into this.
Spams full of html are easy to filter.  The smarter
spammers already avoid it.  So
performance in the future should not depend much on how
you deal with html.<br><br><b>Performance</b><br><br>Between December 10 2002 and January 10 2003 I got about
1750 spams.  
Of these, 4 got through.  That's a filtering
rate of about 99.75%.<br><br>Two of the four spams I missed got through because they
happened to use words that occur often in my legitimate
email.<br><br>The third was one of those that exploit
an insecure cgi script to send mail to third parties.
They're hard to filter based just
on the content because the headers are innocent and   
they're careful about the words they use.  Even so I can
usually catch them.  This one squeaked by with a
probability of .88, just under the threshold of .9.<br><br>Of course, looking at multiple token sequences
would catch it easily.  ``Below is the result of
your feedback form'' is an instant giveaway.<br><br>The fourth spam was what I call
a spam-of-the-future, because this is what I expect spam to
evolve into: some completely neutral
text followed by a url.  In this case it was was from
someone saying they had finally finished their homepage
and would I go look at it.  (The page was of course an    
ad for a porn site.)<br><br>If the spammers are careful about the headers and use a
fresh url, there is nothing in spam-of-the-future for filters
to notice.  We can of course counter by sending a
crawler to look at the page.  But that might not be necessary.
The response rate for spam-of-the-future must
be low, or everyone would be doing it.
If it's low enough,
it <a href="wfks.html">won't pay</a> for spammers to send it, and we won't 
have to work too hard on filtering it.<br><br>Now for the really shocking news: during that same one-month
period I got <i>three</i> false positives.<br><br>In a way it's
a relief to get some false positives.  When I wrote ``A Plan
for Spam'' I hadn't had any, and I didn't know what they'd
be like.  Now that I've had a few, I'm relieved to find
they're not as bad as I feared.
False positives yielded by statistical
filters turn out to be mails that sound a lot like spam, and
these tend to be the ones you would least mind missing [9].<br><br>Two of the false positives were newsletters
from companies I've bought things from.  I never
asked to receive them, so arguably they
were spams, but I count them as false positives because
I hadn't been deleting them as spams before.  The reason
the filters caught them was that both companies in   
January switched to commercial email senders
instead of sending the mails from their own servers,  
and both the headers and the bodies became much spammier.<br><br>The third false positive was a bad one, though.  It was 
from someone in Egypt and written in all uppercase.  This was
a direct result of making tokens case sensitive; the Plan
for Spam filter wouldn't have caught it.<br><br>It's hard to say what the overall false positive rate is,
because we're up in the noise, statistically.
Anyone who has worked on filters (at least, effective filters) will
be aware of this problem.
With some emails it's
hard to say whether they're spam or not, and these are
the ones you end up looking at when you get filters       
really tight.  For example, so far the filter has
caught two emails that were sent to my address because
of a typo, and one sent to me in the belief that I was 
someone else.  Arguably, these are neither my spam
nor my nonspam mail.<br><br>Another false positive was from a vice president at Virtumundo.
I wrote to them pretending to be a customer,
and since the reply came back through Virtumundo's 
mail servers it had the most incriminating
headers imaginable.  Arguably this isn't a real false
positive either, but a sort of Heisenberg uncertainty
effect: I only got it because I was writing about spam  
filtering.<br><br>Not counting these, I've had a total of five false positives
so far, out of about 7740 legitimate emails, a rate of .06%.
The other two were a notice that something I bought
was back-ordered, and a party reminder from Evite.<br><br>I don't think this number can be trusted, partly
because the sample is so small, and partly because
I think I can fix the filter not to catch
some of these.<br><br>False positives seem to me a different kind of error from
false negatives.
Filtering rate is a measure of performance.  False
positives I consider more like bugs.  I approach improving the
filtering rate as optimization, and decreasing false
positives as debugging.<br><br>So these five false positives are my bug list.  For example, 
the mail from Egypt got nailed because the uppercase text
made it look to the filter like a Nigerian spam.
This really is kind of a bug.  As with
html, the email being all uppercase is really conceptually <i>one</i>
feature, not one for each word.  I need to handle case in a
more sophisticated way.<br><br>So what to make of this .06%?  Not much, I think.  You could
treat it as an upper bound, bearing in mind the small sample size.
But at this stage it is more a measure of the bugs
in my implementation than some intrinsic false positive rate
of Bayesian filtering.<br><br><b>Future</b><br><br>What next?  Filtering is an optimization problem,
and the key to optimization is profiling.  Don't
try to guess where your code is slow, because you'll
guess wrong.  <i>Look</i> at where your code is slow,
and fix that.  In filtering, this translates to:   
look at the spams you miss, and figure out what you
could have done to catch them.<br><br>For example, spammers are now working aggressively to   
evade filters, and one of the things they're doing is
breaking up and misspelling words to prevent filters from
recognizing them.  But working on this is not my first
priority, because I still have no trouble catching these
spams [10].<br><br>There are two kinds of spams I currently do
have trouble with.
One is the type that pretends to be an email from 
a woman inviting you to go chat with her or see her profile on a dating
site.  These get through because they're the one type of
sales pitch you can make without using sales talk.  They use
the same vocabulary as ordinary email.<br><br>The other kind of spams I have trouble filtering are those
from companies in e.g. Bulgaria offering contract programming 
services.   These get through because I'm a programmer too, and
the spams are full of the same words as my real mail.<br><br>I'll probably focus on the personal ad type first.  I think if
I look closer I'll be able to find statistical differences
between these and my real mail.  The style of writing is
certainly different, though it may take multiword filtering
to catch that.
Also, I notice they tend to repeat the url,
and someone including a url in a legitimate mail wouldn't do that [11].<br><br>The outsourcing type are going to be hard to catch.  Even if 
you sent a crawler to the site, you wouldn't find a smoking
statistical gun.
Maybe the only answer is a central list of
domains advertised in spams [12].  But there can't be that
many of this type of mail.  If the only
spams left were unsolicited offers of contract programming
services from Bulgaria, we could all probably move on to
working on something else.<br><br>Will statistical filtering actually get us to that point?
I don't know.  Right now, for me personally, spam is
not a problem.  But spammers haven't yet made a serious
effort to spoof statistical filters.  What will happen when they do?<br><br>I'm not optimistic about filters that work at the
network level [13].
When there is a static obstacle worth getting past, spammers
are pretty efficient at getting past it.  There
is already a company called Assurance Systems that will
run your mail through Spamassassin and tell you whether 
it will get filtered out.<br><br>Network-level filters won't be completely useless.
They may be enough to kill all the "opt-in"
spam, meaning spam from companies like Virtumundo and
Equalamail who claim that they're really running opt-in lists.
You can filter those based just on the headers, no
matter what they say in the body.  But anyone willing to
falsify headers or use open relays, presumably including
most porn spammers, should be able to get some message past
network-level filters if they want to.  (By no means the
message they'd like to send though, which is something.)<br><br>The kind of filters I'm optimistic about are ones that
calculate probabilities based on each individual user's mail.
These can be much more effective, not only in
avoiding false positives, but in filtering too: for example,
finding the recipient's email address base-64 encoded anywhere in
a message is a very good spam indicator.<br><br>But the real advantage of individual filters is that they'll all be
different.  If everyone's filters have different probabilities,
it will make the spammers' optimization loop, what programmers
would call their edit-compile-test cycle, appallingly slow.  
Instead of just tweaking a spam till it gets through a copy of
some filter they have on their desktop, they'll have to do a
test mailing for each tweak.  It would be like programming in
a language without an interactive toplevel, 
and I wouldn't wish that
on anyone.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1]
Paul Graham.  ``A Plan for Spam.'' August 2002.
http://paulgraham.com/spam.html.<br><br>Probabilities in this algorithm are
calculated using a degenerate case of Bayes' Rule.  There are
two simplifying assumptions: that the probabilities
of features (i.e. words) are independent, and that we know
nothing about the prior probability of an email being
spam.<br><br>The first assumption is widespread in text classification.
Algorithms that use it are called ``naive Bayesian.''<br><br>The second assumption I made because the proportion of spam in
my incoming mail fluctuated so much from day to day (indeed,
from hour to hour) that the overall prior ratio seemed
worthless as a predictor.  If you assume that P(spam) and
P(nonspam) are both .5, they cancel out and you can
remove them from the formula.<br><br>If you were doing Bayesian filtering in a situation where  
the ratio of spam to nonspam was consistently very high or
(especially) very low, you could probably improve filter
performance by incorporating prior probabilities.  To do
this right you'd have to track ratios by time of day, because
spam and legitimate mail volume both have distinct daily
patterns.<br><br>[2]

Classification &amp; Organization Program.''  Proceedings of AAAI-98

Mehran Sahami, Susan Dumais, David Heckerman and Eric Horvitz.
``A Bayesian Approach to Filtering Junk E-Mail.'' Proceedings of AAAI-98
Workshop on Learning for Text Categorization.<br><br>[4] At the time I had zero false positives out of about 4,000 
legitimate emails.  If the next legitimate email was
a false positive, this would give us .03%.  These false positive
rates are untrustworthy, as I explain later. I quote
a number here only to emphasize that whatever the false positive rate
is, it is less than 1.16%.
<!--As an indication of how widely divergent these results
are, a filter that simply looked for the word ``click'' would in
August 2002 catch 79.7% of my spam with 1.2% false positives.--><br><br>[5] Bill Yerazunis. ``Sparse Binary Polynomial Hash Message
Filtering and The CRM114 Discriminator.''  Proceedings of 2003
Spam Conference.<br><br>[6] In ``A Plan for Spam'' I used thresholds of .99 and .01.
It seems justifiable to use thresholds proportionate to the
size of the corpora.  Since I now have on the order of 10,000 of each
type of mail, I use .9999 and .0001.<br><br>[7] There is a flaw here I should probably fix.  Currently,
when ``Subject*foo'' degenerates to just ``foo'', what that means is
you're getting the stats for occurrences of ``foo'' in
the body or header lines other than those I mark.
What I should do is keep track of statistics for ``foo''
overall as well as specific versions, and degenerate from
``Subject*foo'' not to ``foo'' but to ``Anywhere*foo''.  Ditto for
case: I should degenerate from uppercase to any-case, not
lowercase.<br><br>It would probably be a win to do this with prices
too, e.g. to degenerate from ``$129.99'' to ``$--9.99'', ``$--.99'',
and ``$--''.<br><br>You could also degenerate from words to their stems,
but this would probably only improve filtering rates early on 
when you had small corpora.<br><br>[8] Steven Hauser.  ``Statistical Spam Filter Works for Me.''
http://www.sofbot.com.<br><br>[9] False positives are not all equal, and we should remember
this when comparing techniques for stopping spam.
Whereas many of the false positives caused by filters
will be near-spams that you wouldn't mind missing,
false positives caused by blacklists, for example, will be just
mail from people who chose the wrong ISP.  In both
cases you catch mail that's near spam, but for blacklists nearness
is physical, and for filters it's textual.
<!--
In fairness, it should be added that the new generation of
responsible blacklists, like the SBL, cause far fewer false positives than
earlier blacklists like the MAPS RBL, for whom causing
large numbers of false positives was a deliberate technique
to get the attention of ISPs. --><br><br>[10] If spammers get good enough at obscuring tokens   
for this to be a problem, we can respond by simply removing
whitespace, periods, commas, etc.  and using a dictionary to
pick the words out of the resulting sequence.
And of course finding words this way that weren't visible in
the original text would in itself be evidence of spam.<br><br>Picking out the words won't be trivial.  It will require 
more than just reconstructing word boundaries; spammers
both add (``xHot nPorn cSite'') and omit (``P#rn'') letters.
Vision research may be useful here, since human vision is
the limit that such tricks will approach.<br><br>[11] 
In general, spams are more repetitive than regular email.   
They want to pound that message home.  I currently don't
allow duplicates in the top 15 tokens, because
you could get a false positive if the sender happens to use
some bad word multiple times. (In my current filter, ``dick'' has
a spam probabilty of .9999, but it's also a name.)
It seems we should at least notice duplication though,
so I may try allowing up to two of each token, as Brian Burton does in
SpamProbe.<br><br>[12]  This is what approaches like Brightmail's will
degenerate into once spammers are pushed into using mad-lib
techniques to generate everything else in the message.<br><br>[13]
It's sometimes argued that we should be working on filtering
at the network level, because it is more efficient.  What people
usually mean when they say this is: we currently filter at the
network level, and we don't want to start over from scratch.
But you can't dictate the problem to fit your solution.<br><br>Historically, scarce-resource arguments have been the losing

of the school lunch tables according to popularity. This was easy
to do, because kids only ate lunch with others of about the same
popularity. We graded them from A to E. A tables were full of
football players and cheerleaders and so on. E tables contained the
kids with mild cases of Down's Syndrome, what in the language of
the time we called "retards."<br><br>We sat at a D table, as low as you could get without looking
physically different. We were not being especially candid to grade
ourselves as D. It would have taken a deliberate lie to say otherwise.
Everyone in the school knew exactly how popular everyone else was,
including us.<br><br>My stock gradually rose during high school. Puberty finally arrived;
I became a decent soccer player; I started a scandalous underground
newspaper.  So I've seen a good part of the popularity landscape.<br><br>I know a lot of people who were nerds in school, and they all tell
the same story: there is a strong correlation between being smart
and being a nerd, and an even stronger inverse correlation between
being a nerd and being popular. Being smart seems to <i>make</i> you
unpopular.<br><br>Why? To someone in school now, that may seem an odd question to
ask. The mere fact is so overwhelming that it may seem strange to
imagine that it could be any other way. But it could. Being smart
doesn't make you an outcast in elementary school. Nor does it harm
you in the real world. Nor, as far as I can tell, is the problem
so bad in most other countries. But in a typical American secondary
school, being smart is likely to make your life difficult.  Why?<br><br><br><br>
The key to this mystery is to rephrase the question slightly. Why
don't smart kids make themselves popular? If they're so smart, why
don't they figure out how popularity works and beat the system,
just as they do for standardized tests?<br><br>One argument says that this would be impossible, that the smart
kids are unpopular because the other kids envy them for being smart,
and nothing they could do could make them popular. I wish. If the
other kids in junior high school envied me, they did a great job
of concealing it. And in any case, if being smart were really an
enviable quality, the girls would have broken ranks. The guys that
guys envy, girls like.<br><br>In the schools I went to, being smart just didn't matter much. Kids
didn't admire it or despise it. All other things being equal, they
would have preferred to be on the smart side of average rather than the
dumb side, but intelligence counted far less than, say, physical
appearance, charisma, or athletic ability.<br><br>So if intelligence in itself is not a factor in popularity, why are
smart kids so consistently unpopular? The answer, I think, is that
they don't really want to be popular.<br><br>If someone had told me that at the time, I would have laughed at
him. Being unpopular in school makes kids miserable, some of them
so miserable that they commit suicide. Telling me that I didn't
want to be popular would have seemed like telling someone dying of
thirst in a desert that he didn't want a glass of water. Of course
I wanted to be popular.<br><br>But in fact I didn't, not enough. There was something else I wanted
more: to be smart. Not simply to do well in school, though that
counted for something, but to design beautiful rockets, or to write
well, or to understand how to program computers. In general, to
make great things.<br><br>At the time I never tried to separate my wants and weigh them
against one another. If I had, I would have seen that being smart
was more important. If someone had offered me the chance to be
the most popular kid in school, but only at the price of being of
average intelligence (humor me here), I wouldn't have taken it.<br><br>Much as they suffer from their unpopularity, I don't think many
nerds would. To them the thought of average intelligence is unbearable.
But most kids would take that deal. For half of them, it would be
a step up. Even for someone in the eightieth percentile (assuming,
as everyone seemed to then, that intelligence is a scalar), who
wouldn't drop thirty points in exchange for being loved and admired
by everyone?<br><br>And that, I think, is the root of the problem. Nerds serve two
masters. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even
more to be smart. And popularity is not something you can do in
your spare time, not in the fiercely competitive environment of an
American secondary school.<br><br><br><br>
Alberti, arguably the archetype of the Renaissance Man, writes that
"no art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you
want to excel in it."
I wonder if anyone in the world works harder
at anything than American school kids work at popularity. Navy SEALs
and neurosurgery residents seem slackers by comparison. They
occasionally take vacations; some even have hobbies. An American
teenager may work at being popular every waking hour, 365 days a
year.<br><br>I don't mean to suggest they do this consciously. Some of them truly
are little Machiavellis, but what I really mean here is that teenagers
are always on duty as conformists.<br><br>For example, teenage kids pay a great deal of attention to clothes.
They don't consciously dress to be popular. They dress to look good.
But to who? To the other kids. Other kids' opinions become their
definition of right, not just for clothes, but for almost everything
they do, right down to the way they walk. And so every effort they
make to do things "right" is also, consciously or not, an effort
to be more popular.<br><br>Nerds don't realize this. They don't realize that it takes work to
be popular. In general, people outside some very demanding field
don't realize the extent to which success depends on constant (though
often unconscious) effort. For example, most people seem to consider
the ability to draw as some kind of innate quality, like being tall.
In fact, most people who "can draw" like drawing, and have spent
many hours doing it; that's why they're good at it. Likewise, popular
isn't just something you are or you aren't, but something you make
yourself.<br><br>The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things
to think about. Their attention is drawn to books or the natural
world, not fashions and parties. They're like someone trying to
play soccer while balancing a glass of water on his head. Other
players who can focus their whole attention on the game beat them
effortlessly, and wonder why they seem so incapable.<br><br>Even if nerds cared as much as other kids about popularity, being
popular would be more work for them. The popular kids learned to
be popular, and to want to be popular, the same way the nerds learned
to be smart, and to want to be smart: from their parents. While the
nerds were being trained to get the right answers, the popular kids
were being trained to please.<br><br><br><br>
So far I've been finessing the relationship between smart and nerd,
using them as if they were interchangeable. In fact it's only the
context that makes them so. A nerd is someone who isn't socially
adept enough. But "enough" depends on where you are. In a typical
American school, standards for coolness are so high (or at least,
so specific) that you don't have to be especially awkward to look
awkward by comparison.<br><br>Few smart kids can spare the attention that popularity requires.
Unless they also happen to be good-looking, natural athletes, or
siblings of popular kids, they'll tend to become nerds. And that's
why smart people's lives are worst between, say, the ages of eleven
and seventeen. Life at that age revolves far more around popularity
than before or after.<br><br>Before that, kids' lives are dominated by their parents, not by
other kids. Kids do care what their peers think in elementary school,
but this isn't their whole life, as it later becomes.<br><br>Around the age of eleven, though, kids seem to start treating their
family as a day job. They create a new world among themselves, and
standing in this world is what matters, not standing in their family.
Indeed, being in trouble in their family can win them points in the
world they care about.<br><br>The problem is, the world these kids create for themselves is at
first a very crude one. If you leave a bunch of eleven-year-olds
to their own devices, what you get is <i>Lord of the Flies.</i> Like
a lot of American kids, I read this book in school. Presumably it
was not a coincidence. Presumably someone wanted to point out to
us that we were savages, and that we had made ourselves a cruel and
stupid world. This was too subtle for me. While the book seemed
entirely believable, I didn't get the additional message. I wish
they had just told us outright that we were savages and our world
was stupid.<br><br><br><br>
Nerds would find their unpopularity more bearable if it merely
caused them to be ignored. Unfortunately, to be unpopular in school
is to be actively persecuted.<br><br>Why? Once again, anyone currently in school might think this a
strange question to ask. How could things be any other way? But
they could be. Adults don't normally persecute nerds. Why do teenage
kids do it?<br><br>Partly because teenagers are still half children, and many
children are just intrinsically cruel. Some torture nerds for the
same reason they pull the legs off spiders. Before you develop a
conscience, torture is amusing.<br><br>Another reason kids persecute nerds is to make themselves feel
better. When you tread water, you lift yourself up by pushing water
down. Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own
position will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think
rank below. I've read that this is why poor whites in the United
States are the group most hostile to blacks.<br><br>But I think the main reason other kids persecute nerds is that it's
part of the mechanism of popularity. Popularity is only partially
about individual attractiveness. It's much more about alliances.
To become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that
bring you close to other popular people, and nothing brings people
closer than a common enemy.<br><br>Like a politician who wants to distract voters from bad times at
home, you can create an enemy if there isn't a real one. By singling
out and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in the
hierarchy create bonds between themselves. Attacking an outsider
makes them all insiders. This is why the worst cases of bullying
happen with groups. Ask any nerd: you get much worse treatment from
a group of kids than from any individual bully, however sadistic.<br><br>If it's any consolation to the nerds, it's nothing personal. The
group of kids who band together to pick on you are doing the same
thing, and for the same reason, as a bunch of guys who get together
to go hunting. They don't actually hate you. They just need something
to chase.<br><br>Because they're at the bottom of the scale, nerds are a safe target
for the entire school. If I remember correctly, the most popular
kids don't persecute nerds; they don't need to stoop to such things.
Most of the persecution comes from kids lower down, the nervous
middle classes.<br><br>The trouble is, there are a lot of them. The distribution of
popularity is not a pyramid, but tapers at the bottom like a pear.
The least popular group is quite small. (I believe we were the only
D table in our cafeteria map.) So there are more people who want
to pick on nerds than there are nerds.<br><br>As well as gaining points by distancing oneself from unpopular kids,
one loses points by being close to them. A woman I know says that
in high school she liked nerds, but was afraid to be seen talking
to them because the other girls would make fun of her. Unpopularity
is a communicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will still
ostracize them in self-defense.<br><br>It's no wonder, then, that smart kids tend to be unhappy in middle
school and high school. Their other interests leave them little
attention to spare for popularity, and since popularity resembles
a zero-sum game, this in turn makes them targets for the whole
school. And the strange thing is, this nightmare scenario happens
without any conscious malice, merely because of the shape of the
situation.<br><br><br><br>
For me the worst stretch was junior high, when kid culture was new
and harsh, and the specialization that would later gradually separate
the smarter kids had barely begun. Nearly everyone I've talked to
agrees: the nadir is somewhere between eleven and fourteen.<br><br>In our school it was eighth grade, which was ages twelve and thirteen
for me. There was a brief sensation that year when one of our
teachers overheard a group of girls waiting for the school bus, and
was so shocked that the next day she devoted the whole class to an
eloquent plea not to be so cruel to one another.<br><br>It didn't have any noticeable effect. What struck me at the time
was that she was surprised. You mean she doesn't know the kind of
things they say to one another? You mean this isn't normal?<br><br>It's important to realize that, no, the adults don't know what the
kids are doing to one another. They know, in the abstract, that
kids are monstrously cruel to one another, just as we know in the
abstract that people get tortured in poorer countries. But, like
us, they don't like to dwell on this depressing fact, and they don't
see evidence of specific abuses unless they go looking for it.<br><br>Public school teachers are in much the same position as prison
wardens. Wardens' main concern is to keep the prisoners on the
premises. They also need to keep them fed, and as far as possible
prevent them from killing one another. Beyond that, they want to
have as little to do with the prisoners as possible, so they leave
them to create whatever social organization they want. From what
I've read, the society that the prisoners create is warped, savage,
and pervasive, and it is no fun to be at the bottom of it.<br><br>In outline, it was the same at the schools I went to. The most
important thing was to stay on the premises. While there, the
authorities fed you, prevented overt violence, and made some effort
to teach you something. But beyond that they didn't want to have
too much to do with the kids. Like prison wardens, the teachers
mostly left us to ourselves. And, like prisoners, the culture we
created was barbaric.<br><br><br><br>
Why is the real world more hospitable to nerds? It might seem that
the answer is simply that it's populated by adults, who are too
mature to pick on one another. But I don't think this is true.
Adults in prison certainly pick on one another. And so, apparently,
do society wives; in some parts of Manhattan, life for women sounds
like a continuation of high school, with all the same petty intrigues.<br><br>I think the important thing about the real world is not that it's
populated by adults, but that it's very large, and the things you
do have real effects. That's what school, prison, and ladies-who-lunch
all lack. The inhabitants of all those worlds are trapped in little
bubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect.
Naturally these societies degenerate into savagery. They have no
function for their form to follow.<br><br>When the things you do have real effects, it's no longer enough
just to be pleasing. It starts to be important to get the right
answers, and that's where nerds show to advantage. Bill Gates will
of course come to mind. Though notoriously lacking in social skills,
he gets the right answers, at least as measured in revenue.<br><br>The other thing that's different about the real world is that it's
much larger. In a large enough pool, even the smallest minorities
can achieve a critical mass if they clump together. Out in the real
world, nerds collect in certain places and form their own societies
where intelligence is the most important thing. Sometimes the current
even starts to flow in the other direction: sometimes, particularly
in university math and science departments, nerds deliberately
exaggerate their awkwardness in order to seem smarter. John Nash
so admired Norbert Wiener that he adopted his habit of touching the
wall as he walked down a corridor.<br><br><br><br>
As a thirteen-year-old kid, I didn't have much more experience of
the world than what I saw immediately around me. The warped little
world we lived in was, I thought, <i>the world.</i> The world seemed cruel
and boring, and I'm not sure which was worse.<br><br>Because I didn't fit into this world, I thought that something must
be wrong with me. I didn't realize that the reason we nerds didn't
fit in was that in some ways
we were a step ahead. We were already thinking about
the kind of things that matter in the real world, instead of spending
all our time playing an exacting but mostly pointless game like the
others.<br><br>We were a bit like an adult would be if he were thrust back into
middle school. He wouldn't know the right clothes to wear, the right
music to like, the right slang to use. He'd seem to the kids a
complete alien. The thing is, he'd know enough not to care what
they thought. We had no such confidence.<br><br>A lot of people seem to think it's good for smart kids to be thrown
together with "normal" kids at this stage of their lives. Perhaps.
But in at least some cases the reason the nerds don't fit in really
is that everyone else is crazy. I remember sitting in the audience
at a "pep rally" at my high school, watching as the cheerleaders
threw an effigy of an opposing player into the audience to be torn
to pieces. I felt like an explorer witnessing some bizarre tribal
ritual.<br><br><br><br>
If I could go back and give my thirteen year old self some advice,
the main thing I'd tell him would be to stick his head up and look
around. I didn't really grasp it at the time, but the whole world
we lived in was as fake as a Twinkie. Not just school, but the
entire town. Why do people move to suburbia? To have kids! So no
wonder it seemed boring and sterile. The whole place was a giant
nursery, an artificial town created explicitly for the purpose of
breeding children.<br><br>Where I grew up, it felt as if there was nowhere to go, and nothing
to do. This was no accident. Suburbs are deliberately designed to
exclude the outside world, because it contains things that could
endanger children.<br><br>And as for the schools, they were just holding pens within this
fake world. Officially the purpose of schools is to teach kids. In
fact their primary purpose is to keep kids locked up in one
place for a big chunk of the day so adults can get things done. And
I have no problem with this: in a specialized industrial society,
it would be a disaster to have kids running around loose.<br><br>What bothers me is not that the kids are kept in prisons, but that
(a) they aren't told about it, and (b) the prisons are run mostly
by the inmates. Kids are sent off to spend six years memorizing
meaningless facts in a world ruled by a caste of giants who run
after an oblong brown ball, as if this were the most natural thing
in the world. And if they balk at this surreal cocktail, they're
called misfits.<br><br><br><br>
Life in this twisted world is stressful for the kids. And not just
for the nerds. Like any war, it's damaging even to the winners.<br><br>Adults can't avoid seeing that teenage kids are tormented. So why
don't they do something about it? Because they blame it on puberty.
The reason kids are so unhappy, adults tell themselves, is that
monstrous new chemicals, <i>hormones</i>, are now coursing through their
bloodstream and messing up everything. There's nothing wrong with
the system; it's just inevitable that kids will be miserable at
that age.<br><br>This idea is so pervasive that even the kids believe it, which
probably doesn't help. Someone who thinks his feet naturally hurt
is not going to stop to consider the possibility that he is wearing
the wrong size shoes.<br><br>I'm suspicious of this theory that thirteen-year-old kids are
intrinsically messed up. If it's physiological, it should be
universal. Are Mongol nomads all nihilists at thirteen? I've read
a lot of history, and I have not seen a single reference
to this supposedly universal fact before the twentieth century.
Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance seem to have been cheerful
and eager. They got in fights and played tricks on one another of
course (Michelangelo had his nose broken by a bully), but they
weren't crazy.<br><br>As far as I can tell, the concept of the hormone-crazed teenager
is coeval with suburbia. I don't think this is a coincidence. I
think teenagers are driven crazy by the life they're made to lead.
Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance were working dogs. Teenagers
now are neurotic lapdogs. Their craziness is the craziness of the
idle everywhere.<br><br><br><br>
When I was in school, suicide was a constant topic among the smarter
kids. No one I knew did it, but several planned to, and
some may have tried. Mostly this was just a pose. Like other
teenagers, we loved the dramatic, and suicide seemed very dramatic.
But partly it was because our lives were at times genuinely miserable.<br><br>Bullying was only part of the problem. Another problem, and possibly
an even worse one, was that we never had anything real to work on.
Humans like to work; in most of the world, your work is your identity.
And all the work we did was 
<a href="essay.html">pointless</a>, or seemed so at the time.<br><br>At best it was practice for real work we might do far in the future,
so far that we didn't even know at the time what we were practicing
for. More often it was just an arbitrary series of hoops to jump
through, words without content designed mainly for testability.
(The three main causes of the Civil War were....
Test: List the three main causes of the Civil War.)<br><br>And there was no way to opt out. The adults had agreed among
themselves that this was to be the route to college. The only way
to escape this empty life was to submit to it.<br><br><br><br>
Teenage kids used to have a more active role in society. In
pre-industrial times, they were all apprentices of one sort or
another, whether in shops or on farms or even on warships. They
weren't left to create their own societies. They were junior members
of adult societies.<br><br>Teenagers seem to have respected adults more then, because
the adults were the visible experts in the skills they were trying
to learn. Now most kids have little idea what their parents do in
their distant offices, and see no connection (indeed, there is
precious little) between schoolwork and the work they'll do as
adults.<br><br>And if teenagers respected adults more, adults also had more use
for teenagers. After a couple years' training, an apprentice could
be a real help. Even the newest apprentice could be made to carry
messages or sweep the workshop.<br><br>Now adults have no immediate use for teenagers. They would be in
the way in an office. So they drop them off at school on their way
to work, much as they might drop the dog off at a kennel if they  
were going away for the weekend.<br><br>What happened? We're up against a hard one here. The cause of this
problem is the same as the cause of so many present ills: specialization.
As jobs become more specialized, we have to train longer for them.
Kids in pre-industrial times started working at about 14 at
the latest; kids on farms, where most people lived, began far  
earlier. Now kids who go to college don't start working full-time 
till 21 or 22. With some degrees, like MDs and PhDs, you may not
finish your training till 30.<br><br>Teenagers now are useless, except as cheap labor in industries like
fast food, which evolved to exploit precisely this fact. In almost
any other kind of work, they'd be a net loss. But they're also too 
young to be left unsupervised. Someone has to watch over them, and
the most efficient way to do this is to collect them together in
one place. Then a few adults can watch all of them.<br><br>If you stop there, what you're describing is literally a prison,
albeit a part-time one. The problem is, many schools practically
do stop there. The stated purpose of schools is to educate the kids.
But there is no external pressure to do this well. And so most
schools do such a bad job of teaching that the kids don't really
take it seriously-- not even the smart kids. Much of the time we
were all, students and teachers both, just going through the motions.<br><br>In my high school French class we were supposed to read Hugo's <i>Les
Miserables.</i> I don't think any of us knew French well enough to make
our way through this enormous book. Like the rest of the class, I   
just skimmed the Cliff's Notes. When we were given a test on the
book, I noticed that the questions sounded odd. They were full of   
long words that our teacher wouldn't have used. Where had these   
questions come from? From the Cliff's Notes, it turned out. The 
teacher was using them too. We were all just pretending.<br><br>There are certainly great public school teachers.  The energy and 
imagination of my fourth grade teacher, Mr. Mihalko, made that  
year something his students still talk about, thirty years later.
But teachers like him were individuals swimming
upstream. They couldn't fix the system.<br><br><br><br>
In almost any group of people you'll find hierarchy.
When groups of adults form in the real world, it's generally for  
some common purpose, and the leaders end up being those who are best
at it. The problem with most schools is, they have no purpose. 
But hierarchy there must be.
And so the kids make one out of nothing.<br><br>We have a phrase to describe what happens when rankings have to be
created without any meaningful criteria. We say that the situation
<i>degenerates into a popularity contest.</i> And that's exactly what
happens in most American schools.
Instead of depending on some real test, one's rank
depends mostly on one's ability to increase one's rank. It's
like the court of Louis XIV. There is no external opponent, so the
kids become one another's opponents.<br><br>When there is some real external test of skill, it isn't painful
to be at the bottom of the hierarchy. A rookie on a football team
doesn't resent the skill of the veteran; he hopes to be like him
one day and is happy to have the chance to learn from him.
The veteran may in turn feel a sense of
<i>noblesse oblige</i>.
And most importantly, their status depends on how well they
do against opponents, not on whether they can push the other down.<br><br>Court hierarchies are another thing entirely. This type of society
debases anyone who enters it. There is neither admiration at the 
bottom, nor <i>noblesse oblige</i> at the top. It's kill or be killed.<br><br>This is the sort of society that gets created
in American
secondary schools. And it happens because these schools have no
real purpose beyond keeping the kids all in one place for a certain
number of hours each day. What I didn't realize at the time, and
in fact didn't realize till very recently, is that the twin horrors
of school life, the cruelty and the boredom, both have the same  
cause.<br><br><br><br>
The mediocrity of American public schools has worse consequences
than just making kids unhappy for six years. It breeds a rebelliousness
that actively drives kids away from the things they're supposed to
be learning.<br><br>Like many nerds, probably, it was years after high school before I
could bring myself to read anything we'd been assigned then.
And I lost more than books. I mistrusted words like "character" and   
"integrity" because they had been so debased by adults. As they
were used then, these words all seemed to mean the same thing:
obedience. The kids who got praised for these qualities tended to 
be at best dull-witted prize bulls, and at worst facile schmoozers.
If that was what character and integrity were, I wanted no part of
them.<br><br>The word I most misunderstood was "tact." As used by adults, it
seemed to mean keeping your mouth shut.
I assumed it was derived from the same root as
"tacit" and "taciturn," and that it literally meant being quiet. I
vowed that I would never be tactful; they were never going to shut
me up. In fact, it's derived from the same root as "tactile," and
what it means is to have a deft touch. Tactful is the opposite of
clumsy. I don't think I learned this until college.<br><br><br><br>Nerds aren't the only losers in the popularity rat race. Nerds are
unpopular because they're distracted. There are other kids who
deliberately opt out because they're so disgusted with the whole  
process.<br><br>Teenage kids, even rebels, don't like to be alone, so when kids opt
out of the system, they tend to do it as a group. At the schools I
went to, the focus of rebellion was drug use, specifically marijuana.
The kids in this tribe wore black concert t-shirts and were called
"freaks."<br><br>Freaks and nerds were allies, and there was a good deal of overlap
between them. Freaks were on the whole smarter than other kids,
though never studying (or at least never appearing to) was an   
important tribal value. I was more in the nerd camp, but I was
friends with a lot of freaks.<br><br>They used drugs, at least at first, for the social bonds they
created. It was something to do together, and because the drugs 
were illegal, it was a shared badge of rebellion.<br><br>I'm not claiming that bad schools are the whole reason kids get
into trouble with drugs. After a while, drugs have their own momentum.
No doubt some of the freaks ultimately used drugs to escape from  
other problems-- trouble at home, for example. But, in my school
at least, the reason most kids <i>started</i> using drugs was rebellion.
Fourteen-year-olds didn't start smoking pot because they'd heard
it would help them forget their problems. They started because they
wanted to join a different tribe.<br><br>Misrule breeds rebellion; this is not a new idea. And yet the
authorities still for the most part act as if drugs were themselves
the cause of the problem.<br><br><br><br>
The real problem is the emptiness of school life. We won't see
solutions till adults realize that. The adults who
may realize it first are the ones who were themselves nerds in  
school. Do you want your kids to be as unhappy in eighth grade as
you were? I wouldn't. Well, then, is there anything we can do to
fix things? Almost certainly. There is nothing inevitable about the
current system. It has come about mostly by default.<br><br>Adults, though, are busy. Showing up for school plays is one thing.
Taking on the educational bureaucracy is another. Perhaps a few
will have the energy to try to change things. I suspect the hardest  
part is realizing that you can.<br><br>Nerds still in school should not hold their breath. Maybe one day
a heavily armed force of adults will show up in helicopters to      
rescue you, but they probably won't be coming this month. Any     
immediate improvement in nerds' lives is probably going to have to
come from the nerds themselves.<br><br>Merely understanding the situation they're in should make it less 
painful. Nerds aren't losers. They're just playing a different game,
and a game much closer to the one played in the real world. Adults
know this. It's hard to find successful adults now who don't claim
to have been nerds in high school.<br><br>It's important for nerds to realize, too, that school is not life.
School is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half feral.
It's all-encompassing, like life, but it isn't the real thing. It's
only temporary, and if you look, you can see beyond it even while
you're still in it.<br><br>If life seems awful to kids, it's neither because hormones are 
turning you all into monsters (as your parents believe), nor because
life actually is awful (as you believe). It's because the adults,
who no longer have any economic use for you, have abandoned you to
spend years cooped up together with nothing real to do.  <i>Any</i> society
of that type is awful to live in.
You don't have
to look any further to explain why teenage kids are unhappy.<br><br>I've said some harsh things in this essay, but really the thesis
is an optimistic one-- that several problems we take for granted
are in fact not insoluble after all. Teenage kids are not inherently
unhappy monsters. That should be encouraging news to kids and adults
both.<br><br><br><br>

life will be like in a hundred years.  There are only a few
things we can say with certainty.  We know that everyone will
drive flying cars,
that zoning laws will be relaxed to allow buildings
hundreds of stories tall, that it will be dark most of the
time, and that women will all be trained in the martial arts.  
Here I want to zoom in on one detail of this
picture.  What kind of programming language will they use to
write the software controlling those flying cars?<br><br>This is worth thinking about not so
much because we'll actually get to use these languages as because,
if we're lucky, we'll use languages on the path from this
point to that.<br><br><br><br>I think that, like species, languages will form evolutionary trees,
with dead-ends branching off all over.  We can see this
happening already.
Cobol, for all its sometime popularity, does not seem to have any
intellectual descendants.  It is an evolutionary dead-end-- a
Neanderthal language.<br><br>I predict a similar fate for Java.  People
sometimes send me mail saying, "How can you say that Java
won't turn out to be a successful language?  It's already
a successful language."  And I admit that it is, if you
measure success by shelf space taken up by books on it
(particularly individual books on it), or by
the number of undergrads who believe they have to
learn it to get a job.  When I say Java won't
turn out to be a successful language, I mean something more
specific:  that Java
will turn out to be an evolutionary dead-end, like Cobol.<br><br>This is just a guess.  I may be wrong.  My point here is not to dis Java,
but to raise the issue of evolutionary
trees and get people asking, where on the tree is language X?
The reason to ask this question isn't just so that
our ghosts can say, in a
hundred years, I told you so.  It's because staying close to  
the main branches is a useful heuristic for finding languages that will
be good to program in now.<br><br>At any given time, you're probably happiest on
the main branches of an evolutionary tree.
Even when there were still plenty of Neanderthals, 
it must have sucked to be one.  The
Cro-Magnons would have been constantly coming over and
beating you up and stealing your food.<br><br>The reason I want to
know what languages will be like in a hundred years is so that
I know what branch of the tree to bet on now.<br><br><br><br>The evolution of languages differs from the evolution of species
because branches can converge.  The Fortran branch, for example,
seems to be merging with the descendants
of Algol.  In theory this is possible for species too, but it's
not likely to have happened to any bigger than a cell.<br><br>Convergence
is more likely for languages partly because the space of
possibilities is smaller, and partly because mutations
are not random.  Language designers deliberately incorporate
ideas from other languages.<br><br>It's especially useful for language designers to think
about where the evolution of programming languages is likely
to lead, because they can steer accordingly. 
In that case, "stay on a main branch" becomes more than a
way to choose a good language.
It becomes a heuristic for making the right decisions about
language design.<br><br><br><br>Any programming language can be divided into
two parts:  some set of fundamental operators that play the role
of axioms, and the rest of the language, which could in principle
be written in terms of these fundamental operators.<br><br>I think the fundamental operators are the most important factor in a
language's long term survival.  The rest you can change.  It's
like the rule that in buying a house you should consider
location first of all.  Everything else you can fix later, but you
can't fix the location.<br><br>I think it's important not just that the axioms be well chosen, 
but that there be few of them.  Mathematicians have always felt 
this way about axioms-- the fewer, the better-- and I think they're
onto something.<br><br>At the very least, it has to be a useful exercise to look closely
at the core of a language to see if there are any axioms that
could be weeded out.  I've found in my long career as a slob that
cruft breeds cruft, and I've seen this happen in software as
well as under beds and in the corners of rooms.<br><br>I have a hunch that
the main branches of the evolutionary tree pass through the languages
that have the smallest, cleanest cores.
The more of a language you can write in itself,
the better.<br><br><br><br>Of course, I'm making a big assumption in even asking what
programming languages will be like in a hundred years.
Will we even be writing programs in a hundred years?  Won't
we just tell computers what we want them to do?<br><br>There hasn't been a lot of progress in that department
so far.
My guess is that a hundred years from now people will
still tell computers what to do using programs we would recognize
as such.  There may be tasks that we
solve now by writing programs and which in a hundred years
you won't have to write programs to solve, but I think
there will still be a good deal of
programming of the type that we do today.<br><br>It may seem presumptuous to think anyone can predict what
any technology will look like in a hundred years.  But
remember that we already have almost fifty years of history behind us.
Looking forward a hundred years is a graspable idea
when we consider how slowly languages have evolved in the
past fifty.<br><br>Languages evolve slowly because they're not really technologies.
Languages are notation.  A program is a formal description of 
the problem you want a computer to solve for you.  So the rate
of evolution in programming languages is more like the
rate of evolution in mathematical notation than, say,
transportation or communications.
Mathematical notation does evolve, but not with the giant
leaps you see in technology.<br><br><br><br>Whatever computers are made of in a hundred years, it seems  
safe to predict they will be much faster than
they are now.  If Moore's Law continues to put out, they will be 74
quintillion (73,786,976,294,838,206,464) times faster.  That's kind of
hard to imagine.  And indeed, the most likely prediction in the
speed department may be that Moore's Law will stop working.
Anything that is supposed to double every eighteen months seems
likely to run up against some kind of fundamental limit eventually.
But I have no trouble believing that computers will be very much
faster. Even if they only end up being a paltry million
times faster, that should change the ground rules for programming
languages substantially.  Among other things, there
will be more room for what
would now be considered slow languages, meaning languages
that don't yield very efficient code.<br><br>And yet some applications will still demand speed.
Some of the problems we want to solve with
computers are created by computers; for example, the
rate at which you have to process video images depends
on the rate at which another computer can
generate them.  And there is another class of problems
which inherently have an unlimited capacity to soak up cycles:
image rendering, cryptography, simulations.<br><br>If some applications can be increasingly inefficient while
others continue to demand all the speed the hardware can
deliver, faster computers will mean that languages have
to cover an ever wider range of efficiencies.  We've seen
this happening already.  Current implementations of some
popular new languages are shockingly wasteful by the
standards of previous decades.<br><br>This isn't just something that happens with programming
languages.  It's a general historical trend.  As technologies improve,
each generation can do things that the previous generation
would have considered wasteful.  People thirty years ago would
be astonished at how casually we make long distance phone calls.
People a hundred years ago would be even more astonished that 
a package would one day travel from Boston to New York via Memphis.<br><br><br><br>I can already tell you what's going to happen to all those extra
cycles that faster hardware is going to give us in the   
next hundred years.  They're nearly all going to be wasted.<br><br>I learned to program when computer power was scarce.
I can remember taking all the spaces out of my Basic programs
so they would fit into the memory of a 4K TRS-80.  The
thought of all this stupendously inefficient software
burning up cycles doing the same thing over and over seems
kind of gross to me.  But I think my intuitions here are wrong.  I'm
like someone who grew up poor, and can't bear to spend money
even for something important, like going to the doctor.<br><br>Some kinds of waste really are disgusting.  SUVs, for example, would
arguably be gross even if they ran on a fuel which would never
run out and generated no pollution.  SUVs are gross because they're
the solution to a gross problem. (How to make minivans look more
masculine.)
But not all waste is bad.  Now that we have the infrastructure
to support it, counting the minutes of your long-distance
calls starts to seem niggling.   If you have the
resources, it's more elegant to think of all phone calls as
one kind of thing, no matter where the other person is.<br><br>There's good waste, and bad waste.  I'm interested
in good waste-- the kind where, by spending more, we can get  
simpler designs.  How will we take advantage of the opportunities
to waste cycles that we'll get from new, faster hardware?<br><br>The desire for speed is so deeply engrained in us, with 
our puny computers, that it will take a conscious effort
to overcome it.  In language design, we should be consciously seeking out
situations where we can trade efficiency for even the
smallest increase in convenience.<br><br><br><br>Most data structures exist because of speed.  For example,
many languages today have both strings and lists.  Semantically, strings
are more or less a subset of lists in which the elements are
characters.  So why do you need a separate data type?
You don't, really.  Strings only
exist for efficiency.  But it's lame to clutter up the semantics
of the language with hacks to make programs run faster.
Having strings in a language seems to be a case of
premature optimization.<br><br>If we think of the core of a language as a set of axioms,  
surely it's gross to have additional axioms that add no expressive
power, simply for the sake of efficiency.  Efficiency is
important, but I don't think that's the right way to get it.<br><br>The right way to solve that problem, I think, is to separate
the meaning of a program from the implementation details. 
Instead of having both lists and strings, have just lists,
with some way to give the compiler optimization advice that 
will allow it to lay out strings as contiguous bytes if
necessary.<br><br>Since speed doesn't matter in most of a program, you won't
ordinarily need to bother with
this sort of micromanagement.
This will be more and more true as computers get faster.<br><br><br><br>Saying less about implementation should also make programs
more flexible.
Specifications change while a program is being written, and this is not
only inevitable, but desirable.<br><br>The word "essay" comes
from the French verb "essayer", which means "to try".
An essay, in the original sense, is something you
write to try to figure something out.  This happens in
software too.  I think some of the best programs were essays,
in the sense that the authors didn't know when they started
exactly what they were trying to write.<br><br>Lisp hackers already know about the value of being flexible
with data structures.  We tend to write the first version of
a program so that it does everything with lists.  These
initial versions can be so shockingly inefficient that it
takes a conscious effort not to think about what they're
doing, just as, for me at least, eating a steak requires a
conscious effort not to think where it came from.<br><br>What programmers in a hundred years will be looking for, most of
all, is a language where you can throw together an unbelievably
inefficient version 1 of a program with the least possible
effort.  At least, that's how we'd describe it in present-day
terms.  What they'll say is that they want a language that's
easy to program in.<br><br>Inefficient software isn't gross.  What's gross is a language
that makes programmers do needless work.  Wasting programmer time
is the true inefficiency, not wasting machine time.  This will
become ever more clear as computers get faster.<br><br><br><br>I think getting rid of strings is already something we
could bear to think about.  We did it in <a href="arc.html">Arc</a>, and it seems
to be a win;  some operations that would be awkward to
describe as regular expressions can be described
easily as recursive functions.<br><br>How far will this flattening of data structures go?  I can think
of possibilities that shock even me, with my conscientiously broadened
mind.  Will we get rid of arrays, for example?  After all, they're
just a subset of hash tables where the keys are vectors of
integers.   Will we replace hash tables themselves with lists?<br><br>There are more shocking prospects even than that.  The Lisp
that McCarthy described in 1960, for example, didn't
have numbers.  Logically, you don't need to have a separate notion
of numbers, because you can represent them as lists:  the integer
n could be represented as a list of n elements.  You can do math this
way.  It's just unbearably inefficient.<br><br>No one actually proposed implementing numbers as lists in
practice.  In fact, McCarthy's 1960 paper was not, at the time,
intended to be implemented at all.  It was a <a href="rootsoflisp.html">theoretical exercise</a>,
an attempt to create a more elegant alternative to the Turing
Machine.  When someone did, unexpectedly, take this paper and
translate it into a working Lisp interpreter, numbers certainly
weren't represented as lists; they were represented in binary,
as in every other language.<br><br>Could a programming language go so far as to get rid of numbers
as a fundamental data type?  I ask this not so much as a serious
question as as a way to play chicken with the future.  It's like
the hypothetical case of an irresistible force meeting an 
immovable object-- here, an unimaginably inefficient
implementation meeting unimaginably great resources.
I don't see why not.  The future is pretty long.  If there's
something we can do to decrease the number of axioms in the core
language, that would seem to be the side to bet on as t approaches
infinity.  If the idea still seems unbearable in a hundred years,
maybe it won't in a thousand.<br><br>Just to be clear about this, I'm not proposing that all numerical
calculations would actually be carried out using lists.  I'm proposing
that the core language, prior to any additional notations about
implementation, be defined this way.  In practice any program
that wanted to do any amount of math would probably represent
numbers in binary, but this would be an optimization, not part of
the core language semantics.<br><br><br><br>Another way to burn up cycles is to have many layers of
software between the application and the hardware.  This too is
a trend we see happening already: many recent languages are
compiled into byte code.  Bill Woods once told me that,
as a rule of thumb, each layer of interpretation costs a
factor of 10 in speed.  This extra cost buys you flexibility.<br><br>The very first version of Arc was an extreme case of this sort
of multi-level slowness, with corresponding benefits.  It
was a classic "metacircular" interpreter written
on top of Common Lisp, with a definite family resemblance
to the eval function defined in McCarthy's original Lisp paper.
The whole thing was only a couple hundred lines of
code, so it was very easy to understand and change.  The 
Common Lisp we used, CLisp, itself runs on top
of a byte code interpreter.  So here we had two levels of
interpretation, one of them (the top one) shockingly inefficient,
and the language was usable.  Barely usable, I admit, but
usable.<br><br>Writing software as multiple layers is a powerful technique
even within applications.  Bottom-up programming means writing
a program as a series of layers, each of which serves as a
language for the one above.  This approach tends to yield
smaller, more flexible programs.  It's also the best route to   
that holy grail, reusability.  A language is by definition
reusable.  The more
of your application you can push down into a language for writing
that type of application, the more of your software will be 
reusable.<br><br>Somehow the idea of reusability got attached
to object-oriented programming in the 1980s, and no amount of
evidence to the contrary seems to be able to shake it free.  But
although some object-oriented software is reusable, what makes
it reusable is its bottom-upness, not its object-orientedness.
Consider libraries: they're reusable because they're language,
whether they're written in an object-oriented style or not.<br><br>I don't predict the demise of object-oriented programming, by the
way.  Though I don't think it has much to offer good programmers,
except in certain specialized domains, it is irresistible to   
large organizations.  Object-oriented programming
offers a sustainable way to write spaghetti code.  It lets you accrete
programs as a series of patches.
<!--, without the effort of understanding, 
or the risk of breaking, existing code. -->
Large organizations
always tend to develop software this way, and I expect this
to be as true in a hundred years as it is today.<br><br><br><br>
As long as we're talking about the future, we had better
talk about parallel computation, because that's where this 
idea seems to live.  That is, no matter when you're talking, parallel
computation seems to be something that is going to happen
in the future.<br><br>Will the future ever catch up with it?  People have been
talking about parallel computation as something imminent 
for at least 20
years, and it hasn't affected programming practice much so far.
Or hasn't it?  Already
chip designers have to think about it, and so must
people trying to write systems software on multi-cpu computers.<br><br>The real question is, how far up the ladder of abstraction will
parallelism go?
In a hundred years will it affect even application programmers?  Or
will it be something that compiler writers think about, but
which is usually invisible in the source code of applications?<br><br>One thing that does seem likely is that most opportunities for
parallelism will be wasted.  This is a special case of my more   
general prediction that most of the extra computer power we're
given will go to waste.  I expect that, as with the stupendous
speed of the underlying hardware, parallelism will be something
that is available if you ask for it explicitly, but ordinarily
not used.  This implies that the kind of parallelism we have in
a hundred years will not, except in special applications, be
massive parallelism.  I expect for
ordinary programmers it will be more like being able to fork off
processes that all end up running in parallel.<br><br>And this will, like asking for specific implementations of data
structures, be something that you do fairly late in the life of a
program, when you try to optimize it.  Version 1s will ordinarily
ignore any advantages to be got from parallel computation, just
as they will ignore advantages to be got from specific representations
of data.<br><br>Except in special kinds of applications, parallelism won't
pervade the programs that are written in a hundred years.  It would be
premature optimization if it did.<br><br><br><br>How many programming languages will there
be in a hundred years?  There seem to be a huge number of new
programming languages lately.  Part of the reason is that
faster hardware has allowed programmers to make different
tradeoffs between speed and convenience, depending on the
application.  If this is a real trend, the hardware we'll  
have in a hundred years should only increase it.<br><br>And yet there may be only a few widely-used languages in a
hundred years.  Part of the reason I say this
is optimism: it seems that, if you did a really good job,
you could make a language that was ideal for writing a   
slow version 1, and yet with the right optimization advice
to the compiler, would also yield very fast code when necessary.
So, since I'm optimistic, I'm going to predict that despite
the huge gap they'll have between acceptable and maximal
efficiency, programmers in a hundred years will have languages 
that can span most of it.<br><br>As this gap widens, profilers will become increasingly important.
Little attention is paid to profiling now.  Many people still
seem to believe that the way to get fast applications is to
write compilers that generate fast code.  As the gap between    
acceptable and maximal performance widens, it will become
increasingly clear that the way to get fast applications is   
to have a good guide from one to the other.<br><br>When I say there may only be a few languages, I'm not including
domain-specific "little languages".  I think such embedded languages
are a great idea, and I expect them to proliferate.  But I expect
them to be written as thin enough skins that users can see
the general-purpose language underneath.<br><br><br><br>Who will design the languages of the future?  One of the most exciting
trends in the last ten years has been the rise of open-source  
languages like Perl, Python, and Ruby.
Language design is being taken over by hackers.  The results
so far are messy, but encouraging.  There are some stunningly  
novel ideas in Perl, for example. Many are stunningly bad, but
that's always true of ambitious efforts.  At its current rate
of mutation, God knows what Perl might evolve into in a hundred
years.<br><br>It's not true that those who can't do, teach (some of the best
hackers I know are professors), but it is true that there are a
lot of things that those who teach can't do.  <a href="desres.html">Research</a> imposes
constraining caste restrictions.  In any academic
field there are topics that are ok to work on and others that
aren't.  Unfortunately the distinction between acceptable and
forbidden topics is usually based on how intellectual
the work sounds when described in research papers, rather than
how important it is for getting good results.  The extreme case
is probably literature; people studying literature rarely  
say anything that would be of the slightest use to those
producing it.<br><br>Though the situation is better in the sciences,
the overlap between the kind of work you're allowed to do and the
kind of work that yields good languages is distressingly small.
(Olin Shivers has grumbled eloquently
about this.)  For example, types seem to be an inexhaustible source
of research papers, despite the fact that static typing
seems to preclude true macros-- without which, in my opinion, no
language is worth using.<br><br>The trend is not merely toward languages being developed
as open-source projects rather than "research", but toward
languages being designed by the application programmers who need
to use them, rather than by compiler writers.  This seems a good
trend and I expect it to continue.<br><br><br><br>
Unlike physics in a hundred years, which is almost necessarily
impossible to predict, I think it may be possible in principle
to design a language now that would appeal to users in a hundred
years.<br><br>One way to design a language is to just write down the program
you'd like to be able to write, regardless of whether there 
is a compiler that can translate it or hardware that can run it.
When you do this you can assume unlimited resources.  It seems
like we ought to be able to imagine unlimited resources as well
today as in a hundred years.<br><br>What program would one like to write?  Whatever is least work.
Except not quite: whatever <i>would be</i> least work if your ideas about
programming weren't already influenced by the languages you're 
currently used to.  Such influence can be so pervasive that   
it takes a great effort to overcome it.  You'd think it would
be obvious to creatures as lazy as us how to express a program
with the least effort.  In fact, our ideas about what's possible
tend to be so <a href="avg.html">limited</a> by whatever language we think in  that
easier formulations of programs seem very surprising.  They're
something you have to discover, not something you naturally
sink into.<br><br>One helpful trick here
is to use the <a href="power.html">length</a> of the program as an approximation for
how much work it is to write.  Not the length in characters,
of course, but the length in distinct syntactic elements-- basically,
the size of the parse tree.  It may not be quite true that
the shortest program is the least work to write, but it's
close enough that you're better off aiming for the solid
target of brevity than the fuzzy, nearby one of least work.
Then the algorithm for language design becomes: look at a program
and ask, is there any way to write this that's shorter?<br><br>In practice, writing programs in an imaginary hundred-year
language will work to varying degrees depending
on how close you are to the core.  Sort routines you can
write now.  But it would be
hard to predict now what kinds of libraries might be needed in
a hundred years.  Presumably many libraries will be for domains that
don't even exist yet.  If SETI@home works, for example, we'll  
need libraries for communicating with aliens.  Unless of course
they are sufficiently advanced that they already communicate
in XML.<br><br>At the other extreme, I think you might be able to design the
core language today.  In fact, some might argue that it was already
mostly designed in 1958.<br><br><br><br>If the hundred year language were available today, would we
want to program in it?  One way to answer this question is to
look back.  If present-day programming languages had been available
in 1960, would anyone have wanted to use them?<br><br>In some ways, the answer is no.  Languages today assume
infrastructure that didn't exist in 1960.  For example, a language
in which indentation is significant, like Python, would not
work very well on printer terminals.  But putting such problems
aside-- assuming, for example, that programs were all just
written on paper-- would programmers of the 1960s have liked
writing programs in the languages we use now?<br><br>I think so.
Some of the less imaginative ones,
who had artifacts of early languages built into their ideas of  
what a program was, might have had trouble.  (How can you manipulate
data without doing pointer arithmetic?  How can you implement 
flow charts without gotos?)  But I think the smartest programmers
would have had no trouble making the most of present-day
languages, if they'd had them.<br><br>If we had the hundred-year language now, it would at least make a
great pseudocode.  What about using it to write software?   
Since the hundred-year language
will need to generate fast code for some applications, presumably
it could generate code efficient enough to run acceptably well
on our hardware.  We might have to give more optimization advice
than users in a hundred years, but it still might be a net win.<br><br><br><br>Now we have two ideas that, if you combine them, suggest interesting
possibilities: (1) the hundred-year language could, in principle, be
designed today, and (2) such a language, if it existed, might be good to
program in today.  When you see these ideas laid out like that,
it's hard not to think, why not try writing the hundred-year language
now?<br><br>When you're working on language design, I think it is good to
have such a target and to keep it consciously in mind.  When you
learn to drive, one of the principles they teach you is to
align the car not by lining up the hood with the stripes painted
on the road, but by aiming at some point in the distance.  Even
if all you care about is what happens in the next ten feet, this
is the right answer.  I
think we can and should do the same thing with programming languages.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>I believe Lisp Machine Lisp was the first language to embody
the principle that declarations (except those of dynamic variables)
were merely optimization advice,
and would not change the meaning of a correct program.  Common Lisp
seems to have been the first to state this explicitly.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Robert Morris, and Dan Giffin for

I was    
asked this question by a student in the audience at a 
talk I gave recently.  Not for the first time, either.<br><br>In languages, as in so many things, there's not much     
correlation between popularity and quality.  Why does   
John Grisham (<i>King of Torts</i> sales rank, 44) outsell
Jane Austen (<i>Pride and Prejudice</i> sales rank, 6191)?
Would even Grisham claim that it's because he's a better
writer?<br><br>Here's the first sentence of <i>Pride and Prejudice:</i>
<blockquote>
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man 
in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a
wife.
</blockquote>
"It is a truth universally acknowledged?"  Long words for
the first sentence of a love story.<br><br>Like Jane Austen, Lisp looks hard.  Its syntax, or lack
of syntax, makes it look completely <a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/acl2.lisp?t=1688221954&amp;">unlike</a> 
the languages
most people are used to.  Before I learned Lisp, I was afraid
of it too.  I recently came across a notebook from 1983
in which I'd written:
<blockquote>
I suppose I should learn Lisp, but it seems so foreign.
</blockquote>
Fortunately, I was 19 at the time and not too resistant to learning
new things.  I was so ignorant that learning
almost anything meant learning new things.<br><br>People frightened by Lisp make up other reasons for not
using it.  The standard
excuse, back when C was the default language, was that Lisp
was too slow.  Now that Lisp dialects are among
the <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/benchmark.php?test=nestedloop&amp;lang=all&amp;sort=cpu">faster</a>
languages available, that excuse has gone away.
Now the standard excuse is openly circular: that other languages
are more popular.<br><br>(Beware of such reasoning.  It gets you Windows.)<br><br>Popularity is always self-perpetuating, but it's especially
so in programming languages. More libraries
get written for popular languages, which makes them still
more popular.  Programs often have to work with existing programs,
and this is easier if they're written in the same language,
so languages spread from program to program like a virus.
And managers prefer popular languages, because they give them 
more leverage over developers, who can more easily be replaced.<br><br>Indeed, if programming languages were all more or less equivalent,
there would be little justification for using any but the most
popular.  But they <a href="icad.html">aren't</a> all equivalent, not by a long
shot.  And that's why less popular languages, like Jane Austen's 
novels, continue to survive at all.  When everyone else is reading 
the latest John Grisham novel, there will always be a few people 
reading Jane Austen instead.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.shiro.dreamhost.com/scheme/trans/iflisp-j.html">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://ro.goobix.com/pg/iflisp/">Romanian Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://cibercalli.com/erick/hackingnews/lispnews/si-lisp-es-tan-grandioso">Spanish Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

an earlier talk at Northeastern.)</i><br><br>When I finished grad school in computer science I went
to art school to study painting.  A lot of people seemed surprised
that someone interested in computers would also be interested in painting.
They seemed to think that
hacking and painting were very different kinds of work-- that
hacking was cold, precise, and methodical, and that
painting was the frenzied expression of some primal urge.<br><br>Both of these images are wrong.  Hacking and painting have a
lot in common.  In fact, of all the different types of people I've
known, hackers and painters are among the most alike.<br><br>What hackers and painters have in common is that they're
both makers.  Along with composers, architects, and writers,
what hackers and painters are trying to do is make good things.
They're not doing research per se, though if in the course of
trying to make good things they discover some new technique,
so much the better.<br><br><br><br>I've never liked the term "computer science."  The main
reason I don't like it is that there's no such thing.
Computer science is a
grab bag of tenuously related areas thrown together
by an accident of history, like Yugoslavia.
At one end you have people who are really mathematicians,
but call what they're doing computer science so they can get DARPA grants.
In the middle you have people working on
something like the natural history of computers-- studying the
behavior of algorithms for routing data through
networks, for example.  And then at the other extreme you
have the hackers, who are trying to
write interesting software, and for whom computers are just a
medium of expression, as concrete is for architects or
paint for painters.  It's as if
mathematicians, physicists, and architects all had to be in
the same department.<br><br>Sometimes what the hackers do is called "software engineering,"
but this term is just as misleading.
Good software designers are no more engineers than architects are.
The border between architecture and engineering is not sharply
defined, but it's there.
It falls between what and how: architects decide what to do,
and engineers figure out how to do it.<br><br>What and how should not be kept too separate.  You're
asking for trouble if you try to decide what to do without
understanding how to do it.
But hacking can certainly be more than just deciding how to
implement some spec.  At its best, it's creating the spec-- though
it turns out the best way to do that is to implement it.<br><br><br><br>Perhaps one day
"computer science" will, like Yugoslavia, get broken up into its
component parts.  That might be a good thing.  Especially if it
meant independence for my native land, hacking.<br><br>Bundling all these different types of work together in one
department may be convenient administratively, but it's confusing
intellectually. That's the other reason I don't like the name
"computer science."  Arguably the people in the middle are doing
something like an experimental science.  But the people at either
end, the hackers and the mathematicians, are not actually doing science.<br><br>The mathematicians don't seem bothered by this.  They happily
set to work proving theorems like the other mathematicians
over in the math department, and probably soon stop noticing
that the building they work in says ``computer science'' on the
outside.  But for the hackers this label is a problem.
If what they're doing is called science, it makes them feel they
ought to be acting scientific.
So instead of doing what they really want to do, which is   
to design beautiful software, hackers in universities and
research labs feel they ought to be writing research papers.<br><br>In the best case, the papers are just a formality.  Hackers write
cool software, and then write a paper about it, and the paper
becomes a proxy for the achievement represented by the software.
But often this mismatch causes problems.  It's easy to
drift away from building beautiful things toward building ugly
things that make more suitable subjects for research papers.<br><br>Unfortunately, beautiful things don't always make the
best subjects for papers.
Number one, research must be original-- and
as anyone who has written a PhD dissertation knows, the way to
be sure that you're exploring virgin territory is to stake
out a piece of ground that no one wants.  Number two, research must be
substantial-- and awkward systems yield meatier papers,
because you can write about the obstacles you have to overcome
in order to get things done.  Nothing yields meaty problems like
starting with the wrong assumptions.  Most of AI is an example
of this rule; if you assume that knowledge can be represented
as a list of predicate logic expressions whose arguments represent
abstract concepts, you'll have a lot of
papers to write about how to make this work.  As Ricky Ricardo
used to say, "Lucy, you got a lot of explaining to do."<br><br>The way to create something beautiful is often to make subtle
tweaks to something that already exists, or to combine existing
ideas in a slightly new way.  This kind of work is hard to
convey in a research paper.<br><br><br><br>So why do universities and research labs continue to judge
hackers by publications?
For the same reason that "scholastic aptitude"
gets measured by simple-minded standardized tests, or
the productivity of programmers gets measured in lines of code.
These tests
are easy to apply, and there is nothing so tempting as an easy test
that kind of works.<br><br>Measuring what hackers are actually trying to do, designing
beautiful software, would be much more difficult.  You need
a good <a href="taste.html">sense of design</a> to judge 
good design.  And
there is no correlation, except possibly
a <a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/features/psp7761121.pdf">negative</a> 
one, between people's ability to recognize good
design and their confidence that they can.<br><br>The only external test is time.  Over time, beautiful
things tend to thrive, and ugly
things tend to get discarded.  Unfortunately, the amounts of time
involved can be longer than human lifetimes.  Samuel Johnson
said it took a hundred years for a writer's reputation to
converge.  You have to wait for the writer's
influential friends to die, and then for all their followers
to die.<br><br>I think hackers just have to resign themselves to having a large random
component in their reputations.  In this they are no different
from other makers.  In fact, they're lucky by comparison.   
The influence of fashion is not nearly so great in hacking as it
is in painting.<br><br><br><br>There are worse things than having people misunderstand your
work.  A worse danger is that you
will yourself misunderstand your work.  Related fields are
where you go looking for ideas.  If you find yourself in the computer science
department, there is a natural temptation to believe, for example,
that hacking is the applied version of what theoretical computer
science is the theory of.   All
the time I was in graduate school I had an uncomfortable feeling
in the back of my mind that I ought to know more theory,
and that it was very remiss of me to have forgotten all that
stuff within three weeks of the final exam.<br><br>Now I realize I was
mistaken.  Hackers need to understand the theory of computation
about as much as painters need to understand paint chemistry.
You need to know how to calculate time and
space complexity and about
Turing completeness.  You might also want to remember at
least the concept of a state machine, in case you have to write
a parser or a regular expression library.  Painters in fact   
have to remember a good deal more about paint chemistry than 
that.<br><br>I've found that the best sources of ideas
are not the other fields that have the word "computer" in
their names, but the other fields inhabited by makers.
Painting has been a much richer source of ideas than the
theory of computation.<br><br>For example, I was taught in college
that one ought to figure out a program
completely on paper
before even going near a computer.  I found that I did not
program this way.  I found that I liked to program
sitting in front of a computer, not a piece of paper.  Worse
still, instead of patiently writing out a complete program
and assuring myself it was correct, I tended to just spew
out code that was hopelessly broken, and gradually beat it into
shape.  Debugging, I was taught, was a kind of final pass where
you caught typos and oversights.  The way I worked, it
seemed like programming consisted of debugging.<br><br>For a long time I felt bad about this, just as I once
felt bad that I didn't hold my pencil the way they taught me
to in elementary school.
If I had only looked over at
the other makers, the painters or the architects, I would
have realized that there was a name for what I was doing:
sketching.  As far as I can tell, the
way they taught me to program in college was all wrong.
You should figure out programs as you're writing them,
just as writers and painters and architects do.<br><br>Realizing this has real implications for software design.
It means that a programming language should, above all, be
malleable.  A programming language is for 
<a href="piraha.html">thinking</a> of
programs, not for expressing programs you've already thought
of.  It should be a pencil, not a pen.  Static typing would
be a fine idea if people actually did write programs the way
they taught me to in college.  But that's not how any of the  
hackers I know write programs.  We need a language that lets us
scribble and smudge and smear, not a language where you have
to sit with a teacup of types balanced on your knee and make
polite conversation with a strict old aunt of a compiler.<br><br><br><br>While we're on the subject of static typing, identifying with
the makers will save us from another problem that afflicts
the sciences: math envy.  Everyone in the sciences
secretly believes that mathematicians are smarter than they are.  
I think mathematicians also believe this.  At any rate,
the result is that scientists tend to make their
work look as mathematical as possible.  In a field like
physics this probably doesn't do much harm, but the further you
get from the natural sciences, the more of a problem it
becomes.<br><br>A page of formulas just looks so impressive.
(Tip: for extra impressiveness, use Greek variables.)  And
so there is a great temptation to work on problems you
can treat formally, rather than problems that are, say,
important.<br><br>If hackers identified with other makers, like writers and
painters, they wouldn't feel tempted to do      
this.  Writers and painters don't suffer from math envy.
They feel as if they're doing something completely unrelated.
So are hackers, I think.<br><br><br><br>If universities and research labs keep hackers from doing
the kind of work they want to do,
perhaps the place for them is in companies.
Unfortunately, most companies won't let hackers do what they
want either.  Universities and research labs force hackers
to be scientists, and companies force them to be engineers.<br><br>I only discovered this myself quite recently.  When Yahoo bought
Viaweb, they asked me what I wanted to do.  I had never
liked the business side very much, and said that I just wanted to
hack.  When I got to Yahoo, I found that what hacking meant
to them was implementing software, not designing it.  Programmers
were seen as technicians who translated the visions (if
that is the word) of product managers into code.<br><br>This seems to be the
default plan in big companies.  They do it because
it decreases the standard deviation of the outcome.
Only a small percentage of hackers can actually design software,
and it's hard for the
people running a company to pick these out.  So instead of
entrusting the future of the software to
one brilliant hacker, most companies set things up so that it is
designed by committee, and the hackers merely
implement the design.<br><br>If you want to make money at some point, remember this,
because this is one of the reasons startups win.  Big companies want
to decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes because they
want to avoid disasters.  But when you damp oscillations, you
lose the high points as well as the low.  This is not a problem for
big companies, because they don't win by making great
products.  Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies.<br><br>So if you can figure out a way to get in a
design war with a company big enough that its software is   
designed by product managers, they'll never be able to keep up
with you.  These opportunities are not easy to find, though.
It's hard to engage a big company in a design war,
just as it's hard to engage an opponent inside a castle in hand
to hand combat.  It would be pretty easy to write a better
word processor than Microsoft Word, for example, but Microsoft,
within the castle of their operating system monopoly,
probably wouldn't even notice if you did.<br><br>The place to fight design wars is in new markets, where no one
has yet managed to establish any fortifications.  That's where
you can win big by taking the bold approach to design, and
having the same people both design and implement the product.  
Microsoft themselves did this at the start.  So did Apple.
And Hewlett-Packard.  I suspect almost every successful startup
has.<br><br><br><br>So one way to build great software is to start your own
startup.  There are two problems with this, though.  One is
that in a startup you have to do so much besides write software.
At Viaweb I considered myself lucky if I
got to hack a quarter of the time.  And the things I had to   
do the other three quarters of the time ranged from tedious
to terrifying.  I have a benchmark for this, because I
once had to leave a board meeting to have
some cavities filled.  I remember sitting back in the
dentist's chair, waiting for the drill, and feeling like
I was on vacation.<br><br>The other problem with startups is that there is not much
overlap between the kind of software that makes money and the
kind that's interesting to write.  Programming languages
are interesting to write, and Microsoft's first product was
one, in fact, but no one will pay for programming languages
now.  If you want to make money, you tend to be forced to work
on problems that are too nasty for anyone to solve for free.<br><br>All makers face this problem.  Prices are
determined by supply and demand, and there is just not as much
demand for things that are fun to work on as there is for
things that solve the mundane problems of individual customers.
Acting in off-Broadway plays just doesn't pay as well as
wearing a gorilla suit in someone's booth at a
trade show.  Writing novels doesn't pay as well as writing
ad copy for garbage disposals.
And hacking programming languages doesn't pay as well
as figuring out how to connect some company's
legacy database to their Web server.<br><br><br><br>I think the answer to this problem, in the case of software,
is a concept known to nearly all makers: the day job.
This phrase began with musicians, who
perform at night.  More generally, it means that you have one
kind of work you do for money, and another for love.<br><br>Nearly all makers have day jobs early in their careers.
Painters and writers notoriously do.  If you're lucky
you can get a day job that's closely
related to your real work.  Musicians often
seem to work in record stores.  A hacker working on some
programming language or operating system might likewise be able to
get a day job using it.  [1]<br><br>When I say that the answer is for hackers to have day jobs, 
and work on beautiful software on the side, I'm not proposing
this as a new idea.  This is what open-source hacking is all   
about.  What I'm saying is that open-source is probably the right
model, because it has been independently confirmed by all the  
other makers.<br><br>It seems surprising to me that any employer would be reluctant
to let hackers work on open-source projects.
At Viaweb, we would have been reluctant to hire anyone
who didn't.  When we interviewed
programmers, the main
thing we cared about was what kind of software they
wrote in their spare time.
You can't do anything really well unless
you love it, and if you love to hack you'll inevitably
be working on projects of your own. [2]<br><br><br><br>Because hackers are makers rather than scientists,
the right place to look for metaphors is not in the
sciences, but among other kinds of makers.  What else can painting
teach us about hacking?<br><br>One thing we can learn, or at least confirm, from the
example of painting is how to learn to hack.  You learn to
paint mostly by doing it.
Ditto for hacking.  Most hackers don't learn to hack by
taking college courses in programming.  They learn to hack
by writing programs of their own at age thirteen.  Even in   
college classes, you learn to hack mostly by hacking. [3]<br><br>Because painters leave a trail of work behind them, you
can watch them learn by doing.  If you look at the work
of a painter in chronological order, you'll find that each  
painting builds on things that have been learned in previous
ones.  When there's something in
a painting that works very well, you can usually find version 
1 of it in a smaller form in some earlier painting.<br><br>I think most makers work this way.  Writers and architects seem
to as well.  Maybe it would be good for hackers
to act more like painters, and regularly start over from scratch,
instead of continuing to work for years on one project, and
trying to incorporate all their later ideas as revisions.<br><br>The fact that hackers learn to hack by doing it is another
sign of how different hacking is from the sciences.  Scientists
don't learn science by doing it, but by doing labs and problem sets.
Scientists start out doing work that's perfect, in the sense
that they're just trying to reproduce work someone else has 
already done for them.
Eventually, they get
to the point where they can do original work.
Whereas hackers, from the start, are doing original work; it's
just very bad.  So hackers start original, and get good, and
scientists start good, and get original.<br><br><br><br>
The other way makers learn is from examples.
For a painter, a museum is a reference library of techniques.
For hundreds of years it has been part of the traditional
education of painters to copy the works of the great masters,
because copying forces you to look closely
at the way a painting is made.<br><br>Writers do this too.
Benjamin Franklin learned to write by summarizing the points   
in the essays of Addison and Steele and then trying to
reproduce them.  Raymond Chandler did the same thing
with detective stories.<br><br>Hackers, likewise, can learn to program by looking at 
good programs-- not just at what they do, but the source
code too.  One of the less publicized benefits
of the open-source movement is that it has made it easier
to learn to program.  When I learned to program, we had to rely
mostly on examples in books.  The one big chunk of
code available then was Unix, but even this was not   
open source.  Most of the people who read the source
read it in illicit photocopies of John Lions' book, which
though written in 1977 was not allowed to be published
until 1996.<br><br><br><br>Another example we can take from painting is the way that
paintings are created by gradual refinement.  Paintings usually
begin with a sketch.
Gradually the details get filled in.
But it is not merely a process of filling in. Sometimes   
the original plans turn out to be mistaken.
Countless paintings,
when you look at them in xrays, turn out to have limbs that
have been moved or facial features that have been readjusted.<br><br>Here's a case where we can learn from painting.  I think hacking
should work this way too.  It's unrealistic
to expect that the specifications for a program will be
perfect. You're
better off if you admit this up front, and write programs in
a way that allows specifications to change on the fly.<br><br>(The structure of large companies makes this hard for them
to do, so here is another place where startups have an advantage.)<br><br>Everyone by now presumably knows about the danger of premature
optimization.  I think we should be just as worried about
premature design-- deciding too early what
a program should do.<br><br>The right tools can help us avoid
this danger.
A good programming language should, like oil paint, make it
easy to change your mind.  Dynamic typing is a win here because
you don't have to
commit to specific data representations up front.
But the key to flexibility, I think, is to make the language
very <a href="power.html">abstract</a>.
The easiest program to change is one that's very short.<br><br><br><br>
This sounds like a paradox, but a great painting
has to be better than it has to be.
For example, when Leonardo
painted the portrait of <a href="ginevra.html">Ginevra de Benci</a>
in the National Gallery, he put a juniper bush behind her head.
In it he carefully
painted each individual leaf.  Many painters might have thought,
this is just something to put in the background to frame
her head.  No one will look that closely at it.<br><br>Not Leonardo.  How hard he worked on part of a painting didn't
depend at all on how closely he expected anyone to look at it.
He was like Michael Jordan.  Relentless.<br><br>Relentlessness wins because, in the aggregate, unseen details
become visible.
When people walk by the portrait of Ginevra de Benci,
their attention is often immediately arrested by it,
even before they look at the label and notice that it says
Leonardo da Vinci.  All those unseen details combine to produce
something that's just stunning, like a thousand barely audible
voices all singing in tune.<br><br>Great software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to
beauty.  If you look inside good software, you find that
parts no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too.
I'm not claiming I write great software, but I
know that when it comes to code I behave in a way that would
make me eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everyday
life the same way.
It drives me crazy to see code that's badly indented,
or that uses ugly variable names.<br><br><br><br>If a hacker were a mere implementor, turning a spec into code, then
he could just work his way through it from one end to the other like
someone digging a ditch.  But if the hacker is a creator, we have
to take inspiration into account.<br><br>In hacking, like painting,
work comes in cycles.  Sometimes you get excited about some
new project and you want to work sixteen hours a day on it. 
Other times nothing seems interesting.<br><br>To do good work you have to take these cycles into
account, because they're affected by how you react to them.
When you're driving a
car with a manual transmission on a hill, you have to back off
the clutch sometimes to avoid stalling.  Backing
off can likewise prevent ambition from stalling.
In both painting and hacking there are some
tasks that are terrifyingly ambitious, and others that are
comfortingly routine.  It's a good idea to save some easy
tasks for moments when you would otherwise stall.<br><br>In hacking, this can literally mean saving up bugs.
I like debugging: it's the
one time that hacking is as straightforward as   
people think it is.  You have a
totally constrained problem, and all you have to do is solve
it.  Your program is supposed to do x.  Instead it does y.
Where does it go wrong? You know you're going to win
in the end.  It's as relaxing as painting a wall.<br><br><br><br>The example of painting can teach us not only how to manage our
own work, but how to work together.  A lot of the
great art of the past is the work of multiple hands, though
there may only be one name on the wall next to it in the
museum.  Leonardo was an apprentice in the workshop of
Verrocchio and painted one of the angels in his <a href="baptism.html">Baptism of
Christ</a>.  This sort of thing was the rule, not the exception.
Michelangelo was considered especially dedicated for insisting
on painting all the figures on the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel himself.<br><br>As far as I know, when painters worked together on a painting,
they never worked on the same parts.  It was common
for the master to paint the principal figures and for assistants
to paint the others and the background.  But you never had
one guy painting over the work of another.<br><br>I think this is the right model for collaboration in software
too.  Don't push it too far.  When a piece of code is
being hacked by three or four different people, no one of whom
really owns it, it will end up being like a common-room.  It will
tend to feel bleak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft.
The right
way to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharply
defined modules, each with a definite owner, and with interfaces
between them that are as carefully designed and, if possible,
as articulated as programming languages.<br><br><br><br>Like painting, most software is intended for
a human audience.  And so hackers, like painters, must have
empathy to do really great work.  You have to be able to see
things from the user's point of view.<br><br>When I was a kid I was always being told to look at things from
someone else's point of view.  What this always meant in
practice was to do what someone else wanted, instead of what
I wanted.  This of course gave empathy a bad name, and I made a
point of not cultivating it.<br><br>Boy, was I wrong.  It turns out that looking at things from 
other people's point of view is practically the secret of
success.  It doesn't necessarily mean being self-sacrificing.
Far from it.  Understanding how someone else sees things
doesn't imply that you'll act in his interest; in some
situations-- in war, for example-- you want to do exactly
the opposite. [4]<br><br>Most makers make things for a human audience.
And to engage an audience you have to understand what they need.
Nearly all the greatest paintings are paintings of people,
for example, because people are what people are interested in.<br><br>Empathy is probably the single most important difference
between a good hacker and a great one.  Some hackers
are quite smart, but when it comes to empathy are
practically solipsists.  It's hard for such      
people to design great software [5], because they can't
see things from the user's point of view.<br><br>One way to tell how good people are at empathy is to watch
them explain a technical question to someone without a technical
background.  We probably all know people who, though otherwise smart,
are just comically bad at this.  If someone asks them at
a dinner party what a programming language is, they'll
say something like ``Oh, a high-level language is what
the compiler uses as input to generate object code.''
High-level language?  Compiler?  Object code?  Someone who 
doesn't know what a programming language is obviously doesn't
know what these things are, either.<br><br>Part of what software has to do is explain itself.  So to   
write good software you have to understand how little users   
understand.
They're going to walk up to the software with no preparation, and
it had better do what they guess it will, because they're
not going to read the manual.  The best system I've ever seen 
in this respect was the original Macintosh, in 1985.
It did what software almost never does: it just worked. [6]<br><br>Source code, too, should explain itself.  If I could get people to
remember just one quote about programming, it would be the
one at the beginning of <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs.</i>  
<blockquote>
Programs should be written for people to read, and
only incidentally for machines to execute.
</blockquote>
You need to have 
empathy not just for your users, but for your readers.  It's in  
your interest, because you'll be one of them.
Many a hacker has written a program only to
find on returning to it six months later that he has no idea   
how it works.  I know several people who've sworn off Perl after
such experiences. [7]<br><br>Lack of empathy is associated with intelligence, to the point
that there is even something of a fashion for it in some places.
But I don't think there's any correlation.
You can do well in math and
the natural sciences without having to learn empathy, and people in these
fields tend to be smart, so the two qualities have come to be
associated.  But there are plenty of dumb people who are bad at
empathy too.  Just listen to the people who call in with questions on
talk shows.  They ask whatever it is they're asking in
such a roundabout way
that the hosts often have to rephrase the question for them.<br><br><br><br>So, if hacking works like painting and writing, is it as cool?
After all, you only get one life.
You might as well spend it working on something great.<br><br>Unfortunately, the question is hard to answer.  There is always
a big time lag in prestige.  It's like light from a distant star.
Painting has prestige now because of great work people did five hundred
years ago.  At the time, no one thought
these paintings were as important as we do today.  It would have
seemed very odd to people at the time that Federico da Montefeltro,
the Duke of Urbino, would one day be known mostly as the guy
with the strange nose in a <a href="montefeltro.html">painting</a> 
by Piero della Francesca.<br><br>So while I admit that hacking doesn't seem as cool as painting now,
we should remember that painting itself didn't seem as cool in
its glory days as it does now.<br><br>What we can say with some confidence is that these are the glory
days of hacking.  In most fields the great work is done early on.
The paintings made between 1430 and 1500 are still unsurpassed.
Shakespeare appeared just as professional theater was being born,
<!-- plays were emerging from crude farces put
on in the courtyards of coaching inns, -->
and pushed the medium
so far that every playwright since has had to live in his shadow.
Albrecht Durer did the same thing with engraving, and Jane Austen
with the novel.<br><br>Over and over we see the same pattern.  A new medium appears, and
people are so excited about it that they explore most of its
possibilities in the first couple generations.   Hacking seems
to be in this phase now.<br><br>Painting was not, in Leonardo's time, as cool as his work
helped make it.
How cool hacking turns out to be will depend on what we can
do with this new medium.  
<!--In some ways, the time lag of
coolness is an advantage.  When you meet someone now who is
writing a compiler or hacking a Unix kernel, at least
you know they're not just doing it to pick up chicks.--><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] The greatest damage that photography has done
to painting may be the fact that it killed the best day job.
Most of the great painters in history supported
themselves by painting portraits.  <!-- Until about 1870, there
was always a cadre of painters trained in the most
difficult task in art, painting the human face from life.  --><br><br>[2] I've been told that Microsoft discourages
employees from contributing to open-source projects, even in
their spare time.
But so many of the best hackers work on open-source
projects now that the main effect of this policy may be
to ensure that they won't be able to hire any first-rate
programmers.<br><br>[3] What you learn about programming in college is much like
what you learn about books or clothes or dating: what bad taste you
had in high school.<br><br>[4] Here's an example of applied empathy.
At Viaweb, if we couldn't decide between two alternatives, we'd
ask, what would our competitors hate most?  At one point a
competitor added a feature to their software that was basically
useless, but since it was one of few they had that we didn't, they
made much of it in the trade press.
We could have tried to explain that the feature was useless,
but we decided it would annoy our competitor more if we
just implemented it ourselves, so we hacked together our own
version that afternoon.<br><br>[5] Except text editors and compilers.  Hackers don't need empathy to
design these, because they are themselves typical users.<br><br>[6] Well, almost.  They overshot the available RAM somewhat,
causing much inconvenient disk swapping, but this could be fixed
within a few months by buying an additional disk drive.<br><br>[7] The way to make programs easy to read is not to
stuff them with comments. I would take Abelson and Sussman's
quote a step further.  Programming languages should be designed
to express algorithms, and only incidentally to tell computers
how to execute them.  A good programming language
ought to be better for explaining software than English.
You should only
need comments when there is some kind of kludge you need to warn
readers about, just as on a road there are only
arrows on parts with unexpectedly sharp curves.

the same amount for painting the Virgin of the Rocks as the workshop
that made the frame for it. --><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Robert Morris, Dan Giffin, and Lisa

An expanded version of that discussion now exists on its own as
<a href="sofar.html">So Far, So Good</a>.)</i>
-->
We may be able to improve the accuracy of Bayesian spam filters
by having them follow links to see what's
waiting at the other end.  Richard Jowsey of
<a href="http://death2spam.com">death2spam</a> now does
this in borderline cases, and reports that it works well.<br><br>Why only do it in borderline cases?  And why only do it once?<br><br>As I mentioned in <a href="wfks.html">Will Filters Kill Spam?</a>,
following all the urls in
a spam would have an amusing side-effect.  If popular email clients
did this in order to filter spam, the spammer's servers
would take a serious pounding.  The more I think about this,
the better an idea it seems.  This isn't just amusing; it
would be hard to imagine a more perfectly targeted counterattack
on spammers.<br><br>So I'd like to suggest an additional feature to those
working on spam filters: a "punish" mode which,
if turned on, would spider every url
in a suspected spam n times, where n could be set by the user. [1]<br><br>As many people have noted, one of the problems with the
current email system is that it's too passive.  It does
whatever you tell it.  So far all the suggestions for fixing
the problem seem to involve new protocols.  This one  
wouldn't.<br><br>If widely used, auto-retrieving spam filters would make
the email system <i>rebound.</i>  The huge volume of the
spam, which has so far worked in the spammer's favor,
would now work against him, like a branch snapping back in   
his face.   Auto-retrieving spam filters would drive the
spammer's 
<a href="http://www.bork.ca/pics/?path=incoming&amp;img=bill.jpg">costs</a> up, 
and his sales down:  his bandwidth usage
would go through the roof, and his servers would grind to a
halt under the load, which would make them unavailable
to the people who would have responded to the spam.<br><br>Pump out a million emails an hour, get a
million hits an hour on your servers.<br><br><!--Of course, if any of the urls
are "web bugs" they'll suggest to the spammer that
the mail got opened, and may result in more spam.  (However,
they'll also tend to make "open rates" meaningless, thus
depriving the spammer of valuable information.)
And of course, some links will be unsubscribe links.  The
net effect might be less spam.
-->
We would want to ensure that this is only done to
suspected spams.  As a rule, any url sent to millions of
people is likely to be a spam url, so submitting every http
request in every email would work fine nearly all the time.
But there are a few cases where this isn't true: the urls
at the bottom of mails sent from free email services like
Yahoo Mail and Hotmail, for example.<br><br>To protect such sites, and to prevent abuse, auto-retrieval
should be combined with blacklists of spamvertised sites.
Only sites on a blacklist would get crawled, and
sites would be blacklisted
only after being inspected by humans. The lifetime of a spam
must be several hours at least, so
it should be easy to update such a list in time to
interfere with a spam promoting a new site. [2]<br><br>High-volume auto-retrieval would only be practical for users
on high-bandwidth
connections, but there are enough of those to cause spammers
serious trouble.   Indeed, this solution neatly
mirrors the problem.  The problem with spam is that in
order to reach a few gullible people the spammer sends 
mail to everyone.  The non-gullible recipients
are merely collateral damage.  But the non-gullible majority
won't stop getting spam until they can stop (or threaten to
stop) the gullible
from responding to it.  Auto-retrieving spam filters offer
them a way to do this.<br><br>Would that kill spam?  Not quite.  The biggest spammers
could probably protect their servers against auto-retrieving 
filters.  However, the easiest and cheapest way for them
to do it would be to include working unsubscribe links in   
their mails.  And this would be a necessity for smaller fry,
and for "legitimate" sites that hired spammers to promote
them.  So if auto-retrieving filters became widespread,
they'd become auto-unsubscribing filters.<br><br>In this scenario, spam would, like OS crashes, viruses, and
popups, become one of those plagues that only afflict people
who don't bother to use the right software.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] Auto-retrieving filters will have to follow redirects,
and should in some cases (e.g. a page that just says
"click here") follow more than one level of links.
Make sure too that
the http requests are indistinguishable from those of
popular Web browsers, including the order and referrer.<br><br>If the response
doesn't come back within x amount of time, default to
some fairly high spam probability.<br><br>Instead of making n constant, it might be a good idea to
make it a function of the number of spams that have been
seen mentioning the site.  This would add a further level of
protection against abuse and accidents.<br><br>[2] The original version of this article used the term
"whitelist" instead of "blacklist".  Though they were
to work like blacklists, I preferred to call them whitelists
because it might make them less vulnerable to legal attack.
This just seems to have confused readers, though.<br><br>There should probably be multiple blacklists.  A single point
of failure would be vulnerable both to attack and abuse.<br><br><!--[6] I don't pretend to have worked out all the
<a href="ffbfaq.html">details</a> of this
scheme.  I can't claim to be certain it will work.  (Who
could till it has been tried in practice?)  Fortunately,
unlike solutions that require new protocols, this one can
be tested on a subset of the problem.  Why not try using   
FFBs on, say, domains that begin with A?
If spammers start to avoid such domains, we'll know we're winning,
and we can roll
down the rest of the alphabet one letter at a time.

and what to do with them.  The latter was till recently something only
a small elite had to think about.  Now we all have to, because
the Web has made us all publishers.)</i>-->
Have you ever seen an old photo of yourself and
been embarrassed at the way you looked?   <i>Did we actually
dress like that?</i>  We did.  And we had no idea how
silly we looked.
It's the nature of fashion to be invisible, in the
same way the movement of the earth is invisible to all
of us riding on it.<br><br>What scares me is that there are moral fashions too.
They're just as arbitrary, and just as invisible to most people.
But they're much more dangerous.
Fashion is mistaken for good design; 
moral fashion is mistaken for good.
Dressing oddly gets you laughed at.  Violating
moral fashions can get you fired, ostracized, imprisoned, or
even killed.<br><br>If you could travel back in a time machine, one thing
would be true no matter where you went: you'd have to watch
what you said.  
Opinions we consider harmless could have 
gotten you in big trouble.
I've already said at least one thing that would have gotten me in big
trouble in most of Europe in the seventeenth century,
and did get Galileo in big trouble when he said
it � that the earth moves. [1]<br><br><!--
Nerds are always getting in

They say improper things
for the same reason they dress unfashionably and have good ideas:
convention has less hold over them.
-->
It seems to be a constant throughout history: In every
period, people believed things that were just ridiculous,
and believed them so strongly that you would have gotten in
terrible trouble for saying otherwise.<br><br>Is our time any different?
To anyone who has read any amount of history, the answer is
almost certainly no.   It would be a remarkable coincidence if ours
were the first era to get everything just right.<br><br>It's tantalizing to think we believe
things that people in the future will find ridiculous.
What <i>would</i> someone coming back to visit us in a time machine
have to be careful not to say?
That's what I want to study here.
But
I want to do more than just shock everyone with
the heresy du jour.  I want to find general
recipes for discovering what you can't say, in any era.<br><br><b>The Conformist Test</b><br><br>Let's start with a test:  
Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express
in front of a group of your peers?<br><br>If the answer is no,
you might want to stop and think about that.  If everything
you believe is something you're supposed to believe, could
that possibly be a coincidence?  Odds are it isn't.  Odds are
you just think what<!--17 ever--> you're told.<br><br>The other alternative would be that you independently considered
every question and came up with the exact same answers that
are now considered acceptable.  That seems unlikely, because
you'd also have to make the same mistakes.  Mapmakers
deliberately put slight mistakes in their maps so they can
tell when someone copies them.  If another map has the same
mistake, that's very convincing evidence.<br><br>Like every other era in history, our moral map almost certainly
contains a few mistakes.  And anyone who makes the same mistakes
probably didn't do it by accident.  It would be
like someone claiming they had independently decided in
1972 that bell-bottom jeans were a good idea.<br><br>If you believe everything you're supposed to now, how can
you be sure you wouldn't also have believed everything you
were supposed to if you had grown up among the plantation
owners of the pre-Civil War South, or in Germany in the 1930s � or
among the Mongols in 1200, for that matter?  Odds are you
would have.<br><br>Back in the era of terms like "well-adjusted," the idea
seemed to be that there was something wrong with
you if you thought things you didn't dare say out loud.
This seems backward.  Almost certainly, there
is something wrong with you if you <i>don't</i> think things
you don't dare say out loud.<br><br><b>Trouble</b><br><br>What can't we say?  One way to find these ideas is simply to look
at things people do say, and get in trouble for.  [2]<br><br>Of course, we're not just looking for things we can't say.   
We're looking for things we can't say that are true, or at least
have enough chance of being true that the question
should remain open.  But many of the
things people get in trouble for saying probably
do make it over this second, lower threshold.  No one
gets in trouble for saying
that 2 + 2 is 5, or that people in Pittsburgh are ten feet tall.
Such obviously false statements might be treated as jokes, or
at worst as evidence of insanity, but they are not likely to
make anyone mad.  The statements that make people mad are
the ones they worry might be believed.
I suspect the statements that make people maddest
are those they worry might be true.<br><br>If Galileo had said that people in Padua were ten feet tall,
he would have been regarded as a harmless eccentric.  Saying   
the earth orbited the sun was another matter.  The church knew
this would set people thinking.<br><br>Certainly, as we look back on the past, this rule of thumb works
well.  A lot of the statements people got in trouble for seem
harmless now.  So it's likely that visitors from the
future would agree with at least some of the statements that
get people in trouble today.  Do we have no Galileos?  Not
likely.<br><br>To find them,
keep track of opinions that get
people in trouble, and start asking, could this be true?
Ok, it may be heretical (or whatever modern equivalent), but
might it also be true?<br><br><b>Heresy</b><br><br>This won't get us all the answers, though.  What if no one
happens to have gotten in trouble for a particular idea yet?
What if some idea would be so radioactively controversial that
no one would dare express it in public?   How can we find these too?<br><br>Another approach is to follow that word, heresy.  In every period
of history, there seem to have been labels that got applied to 
statements to shoot them down before anyone had a chance to ask
if they were true or not.  "Blasphemy", "sacrilege", and "heresy"
were such
labels for a good part of western history, as in more recent times
"indecent", "improper", and "unamerican" have been.   By now these
labels have lost their sting.  They always do.
By now they're mostly used ironically.
But in their time,
they had real force.<br><br>The word "defeatist", for example, has no particular political
connotations now.
But in Germany in 1917 it was a weapon, used by Ludendorff in
a purge of those who favored a negotiated peace.
At the start of World War II it was used
extensively by Churchill and his supporters to silence their
opponents.
In 1940, any argument against Churchill's aggressive policy was "defeatist".
Was it right or wrong?  Ideally, no one got far enough to ask
that.<br><br><!--
(I have this commented out while I investigate whether the current 
 fashion for the word "divisive" really began with the Republicans.
 So far it seems not.  Oops; sorry.<br /><br />We have such labels today, of course, quite a lot of them.  
Many come from the left, including
the startlingly general "inappropriate", but the most recent comes
from the right: "divisive", which the current
administration uses to silence opponents on almost any topic.
-->
We have such labels today, of course, quite a lot of them,
from the all-purpose "inappropriate" to the dreaded "divisive."
In any period, it should be easy to figure out what such labels are,
simply by looking at what people call ideas they disagree
with besides untrue.  When a politician says his opponent is
mistaken, that's a straightforward criticism, but when he
attacks a statement as "divisive" or "racially insensitive"
instead of arguing that it's false, we should start paying
attention.<br><br>So another way to figure out which of our taboos future generations
will laugh at is to start with the
labels.  Take a label � "sexist", for example � and try to think
of some ideas that would be called that.  Then for each ask, might
this be true?<br><br>Just start listing ideas at random?  Yes, because they
won't really be random.  The ideas that come to mind first
will be the most plausible ones.  They'll be things you've already  
noticed but didn't let yourself think.<br><br>In 1989 some clever researchers tracked
the eye movements of radiologists as they scanned chest images for
signs of lung cancer. [3]  They found that even when the radiologists
missed a cancerous lesion, their eyes had usually paused at the site of it.
Part of their brain knew there was something there; it just
didn't percolate all the way up into conscious knowledge. 
I think many interesting heretical thoughts are already mostly   
formed in our minds.  If we turn off our self-censorship
temporarily, those will be the first to emerge.<br><br><b>Time and Space</b><br><br>If we could look into the future it would be obvious which
of our taboos they'd laugh at.
We can't do that, but we can do something almost as good: we can
look into the past.  Another way to figure out what we're
getting wrong is to look at what used to be acceptable
and is now unthinkable.<br><br>Changes between the past and the present sometimes do represent
progress.  In a field like physics,
if we disagree with past generations it's because we're
right and they're wrong.  But this becomes rapidly less true as   
you move away from the certainty of the hard sciences.  By the time
you get to social questions, many changes are just fashion.
The age of consent fluctuates like hemlines.<br><br>We may imagine that we are a great deal smarter and more virtuous than
past generations, but the more history you read, the less likely
this seems.  People in past times were much like us.  Not heroes,
not barbarians.  Whatever their ideas were, they were ideas
reasonable people could believe.<br><br>So here is another source of interesting heresies.  Diff present
ideas against those of various past cultures, and see what you   
get. [4]
Some will be
shocking by present standards.  Ok, fine; but which might also be true?<br><br>You don't have to look into the past to find big differences.   
In our own time, different societies have wildly varying ideas
of what's ok and what isn't.
So you can try diffing other cultures' ideas against ours as well.
(The best way to do that is to visit them.)
<!--17 You might find contradictory taboos.  In one
culture it might seem shocking to think x, while in another
it was shocking not to.  But 
I think usually the shock is on one side.  In one
culture x is ok, and in another it's considered shocking.  My
hypothesis is that the side
that's shocked is most likely to be the mistaken one.
I suspect the only taboos 
 that we can be confident are more than taboos
are the ones that are universal, or nearly so.  Murder for example.
But a-->
Any idea that's considered harmless in a significant
percentage of times and places, and yet is taboo in ours,
is a <!--17 good--> candidate for something we're mistaken
about.<br><br>For example, at the high water mark of political correctness
in the early 1990s, Harvard distributed to its
faculty and staff a brochure saying, among other things, that it
was inappropriate to compliment a colleague or student's
clothes.  No more "nice shirt."
I think this principle is rare among the world's cultures, past or present.
There are probably more where it's considered especially
polite to compliment someone's clothing than where it's considered
improper.
<!--17 So o-->
Odds are this is, in a mild form, an example of one of
the taboos a visitor from the future would
have to be careful to avoid if he happened to set his time machine for
Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1992. [5]<br><br><b>Prigs</b><br><br>Of course, if they have time machines in the future they'll
probably have a separate reference manual just for Cambridge.
This has always been a fussy place, a town of i dotters and
t crossers, where you're liable to get both your grammar and   
your ideas corrected in the same conversation.   And that
suggests another way to find taboos.  Look for prigs,
and see what's inside their heads.<br><br>Kids' heads are repositories of all our taboos.
It seems fitting to us that kids' ideas should be bright and clean.
The picture we give them of the world is 
not merely simplified, to suit their developing minds, 
but sanitized as well, to suit our
ideas of what kids ought to think. [6]<br><br>You can see this on a small scale in the matter of
dirty words.  A lot of my friends are starting to have children
now, and they're all trying 
not to use words like
"fuck" and "shit" within baby's hearing, lest baby start using 
these words too.
But these
words are part of the language, and adults use them all the
time.  So parents are giving their kids an inaccurate idea of 
the language by not using
them.  Why do they do this?  Because they don't think it's
fitting that kids should use the whole language.  We like
children to seem innocent. [7]<br><br>Most adults, likewise, deliberately give kids a misleading
view of the world.
One of the most obvious
examples is Santa Claus.  We think it's cute for little kids to
believe in Santa Claus.  I myself think it's cute for little
kids to believe in Santa Claus.  But one wonders, do we tell
them this stuff for their sake, or for ours?<br><br>I'm not arguing for or against this idea here.  It is probably
inevitable that parents should want to dress up their kids'
minds in cute little baby outfits.  I'll probably do it myself.
The important thing for our purposes is that, as a result,
a well brought-up teenage kid's brain is a more
or less complete collection of all our taboos � and in mint
condition, because they're untainted by experience.  
Whatever we think that will later turn out to be ridiculous, 
it's almost certainly inside that head.<br><br>How do we get at these ideas?  By the following thought experiment.
Imagine a kind of latter-day Conrad character
who has worked for a time as a mercenary in Africa, for a time
as a doctor in Nepal, for a time as the manager of a
nightclub in Miami.  The specifics don't matter � just
someone who has
seen a lot.  Now imagine comparing what's inside this guy's head
with what's inside the head
of a well-behaved sixteen year old girl from
the suburbs.  What does he think that
would shock her?
He knows the world; she knows, or at least embodies, present
taboos.  Subtract one from the other, and the result is what
we can't say.
<!-- bowles quote about dentist's son from long island--><br><br><b>Mechanism</b><br><br>I can think of one more way to figure out what we can't
say: to look at how taboos are created.   How do moral
fashions arise, and why are they adopted?
If we can understand this mechanism, we
may be able to see it at work in our own time.<br><br>Moral fashions don't seem to be created the way ordinary
fashions are.  Ordinary fashions seem to arise by accident when
everyone imitates the whim of some influential person.
The fashion for broad-toed shoes in
late fifteenth century Europe began because Charles VIII of
France had six toes on one foot.  The fashion for the
name Gary began when the actor Frank Cooper adopted the name
of a tough mill town in Indiana.  Moral fashions more often
seem to be created deliberately.  When there's something we
can't say, it's often because some group doesn't want us to.<br><br>The prohibition will be strongest when the group is nervous. 
The irony of Galileo's situation was that he got in trouble
for repeating Copernicus's ideas.  Copernicus himself didn't.
In fact, Copernicus was a canon of a cathedral, and dedicated his
book to the pope.  But by Galileo's time the church was in
the throes of the Counter-Reformation and was much more
worried about unorthodox ideas.<br><br>To launch a taboo, a group has to be poised halfway between
weakness and power.  A confident group doesn't need taboos
to protect it.  It's not considered improper to
make disparaging remarks about Americans, or the English.
And yet a group has to be powerful enough to enforce a
taboo.  Coprophiles, as of this writing, don't seem to be
numerous or energetic enough to have had their
interests promoted to a lifestyle.<br><br>I suspect the biggest source of moral taboos will turn out to
be power struggles in which one side only barely has
the upper hand.  That's where you'll find a group
powerful enough to enforce taboos, but weak enough to need them.<br><br>Most struggles, whatever they're really about, will be cast
as struggles between competing ideas.
The English Reformation was at bottom a struggle for wealth and power,
but it ended up being
cast as a struggle to preserve the souls
of Englishmen from the corrupting influence of Rome.
It's easier to get people to fight for an idea.
And whichever side wins, their
ideas will also be considered to have triumphed, as if God
wanted to signal his agreement by selecting that side as the victor.<br><br>We often like to think of World War II as a triumph
of freedom over totalitarianism.  We conveniently forget that
the Soviet Union was also one of the winners.<br><br>I'm not saying that struggles are never about ideas,
just that they will always be made to seem to be about
ideas, whether they are or not.   And just as there is nothing
so unfashionable as the last, discarded fashion, there is
nothing so wrong as the principles of the most recently
defeated opponent.
<!-- The ideas of the losers in the last war will always trade
at a discount. -->
Representational art is only now
recovering from the approval of both Hitler and Stalin. [8]<br><br>Although moral fashions tend to arise from different sources
than fashions in clothing, the mechanism of their adoption seems
much the same.  The early adopters will be driven by ambition:
self-consciously cool people who want to distinguish themselves
from the common herd.  As the fashion becomes established they'll
be joined by a second, much larger group, driven by fear. [9] This
second group adopt the fashion not because they want to stand
out but because they are afraid of standing out.<br><br>So if you want to figure out what we can't say, look at the
machinery of fashion and try to predict what it would make
unsayable.  What groups are powerful but nervous, and what
ideas would they like to suppress?  What ideas were tarnished by
association when they ended up on the losing side of a recent
struggle?  If a self-consciously cool person wanted to differentiate
himself from preceding fashions (e.g. from his parents), 
which of their ideas would he tend to reject?
What are conventional-minded people afraid of saying?<br><br>This technique won't find us all the things we can't say.
I can think of some that aren't the result of
any recent struggle. Many of our taboos are rooted
deep in the past.  But this approach, combined with the
preceding four, will turn up a good number of unthinkable
ideas.<br><br><b>Why</b><br><br>Some would ask, why would one want to do this?  Why deliberately
go poking around among nasty, disreputable ideas?  Why look 
under rocks?<br><br>I do it, first of all, for the same reason I did look under
rocks as a kid: plain curiosity.  And I'm especially curious about
anything that's forbidden.  Let me see and decide for myself.<br><br>Second, I do it because I don't like the idea of being mistaken.
If, like other eras, we believe things that will later seem ridiculous,
I want to know what they are so that I, at least, can avoid
believing them.<br><br>Third, I do it because it's good for the brain.  To do good work
you need a brain that can go anywhere.  And you especially need a
brain that's in the habit of going where it's not supposed to.<br><br>Great work tends to grow out of ideas
that others have overlooked, and no idea is so overlooked as one that's
unthinkable.
Natural selection, for example.
It's so simple.  Why didn't anyone think of it before?  Well,
that is all too obvious.  Darwin himself was careful to tiptoe
around the implications of his theory.  He wanted to spend his
time thinking about biology, not arguing with people who accused
him of being an atheist.<br><br>In the sciences, especially, it's a great advantage to be able to
question assumptions.
The m.o. of scientists, or at least of the
good ones, is precisely that: look for places where
conventional wisdom is broken, and then try to pry apart the
cracks and see what's underneath.  That's where new theories come
from.<br><br>A good scientist, in other words, does not merely ignore
conventional wisdom, but makes a special effort to break it.
Scientists go looking for trouble.
This should be the m.o. of any scholar, but 
scientists seem much more willing to look under rocks. [10]<br><br>Why?  It could
be that the scientists are simply smarter; most physicists could,
if necessary, make it through a PhD program in French literature,
but few professors of French literature could make it through
a PhD program in physics.  Or it could be because it's clearer
in the sciences whether theories are true or false, and this
makes scientists bolder.  (Or it could be that, because it's
clearer in the sciences whether theories are true or false, you
have to be smart to get jobs as a scientist, rather than just a
good politician.)<br><br>Whatever the reason, there seems a clear correlation between
intelligence and willingness to consider shocking ideas.
This isn't just because smart people actively work to find holes in
conventional thinking.  I think conventions also have
less hold over them to start with.
You can see that in the
way they dress.<br><br>It's not only in the sciences that heresy pays off.
In any competitive field, you can
<a href="avg.html">win big</a> by seeing things that others daren't.  
And in every
field there are probably heresies few dare utter.  Within
the US car industry there is a lot of hand-wringing now
about declining market share.
Yet the cause is so obvious that any observant outsider could
explain it in a second: they make bad cars.  And they have for
so long that by now the US car brands are antibrands � something
you'd buy a car despite, not because of.  Cadillac stopped
being the Cadillac of cars in about 1970.  And yet I suspect
no one dares say this. [11]  Otherwise these companies would have
tried to fix the problem.<br><br>Training yourself to think unthinkable thoughts has advantages
beyond the thoughts themselves.  It's like stretching.
When you stretch before running, you put your body into positions
much more extreme
than any it will assume during the run.
If you can think things
so outside the box that they'd make people's hair stand on end,
you'll have no trouble with the small trips outside the box that
people call innovative.<br><br><b><i>Pensieri Stretti</i></b><br><br>When you find something you can't say, what do you do with it?
My advice is, don't say it.   Or at least, pick your battles.<br><br>Suppose in the future there is a movement to ban
the color yellow. Proposals to paint anything yellow are
denounced as "yellowist", as is anyone suspected of liking the  
color.  People who like orange are tolerated but viewed with
suspicion.  Suppose you realize there is nothing
wrong with yellow.  If you go around saying this, you'll be
denounced as a yellowist too, and you'll find yourself having a   
lot of arguments with anti-yellowists.
If your aim in life is to rehabilitate the color yellow, that may
be what you want.
But if you're mostly interested in
other questions, being labelled as a yellowist will just be
a distraction.  Argue with idiots, and you become an idiot.<br><br>The most important thing is to be able to think what you
want, not to say what you want.  And if you feel you have to
say everything you think, it may inhibit you from thinking  
improper thoughts.  I think it's better to follow the opposite
policy.  Draw a sharp line between your thoughts and your
speech.  Inside your head, anything is allowed.
Within my head I make a point of encouraging the most outrageous
thoughts I can imagine. 
But, as in
a secret society, nothing that happens within the building
should be told to outsiders.  The first rule of Fight
Club is, you do not talk about Fight Club.<br><br>When Milton was going to visit Italy in the 1630s,
Sir Henry Wootton, who had been ambassador to Venice, told him
his motto should be
<i>"i pensieri stretti &amp; il viso sciolto."</i>  Closed thoughts
and an open face.  Smile at everyone, and don't tell them
what you're thinking.   This was wise advice.
Milton was an argumentative fellow, and the Inquisition
was a bit restive at that time.  But I think the difference 
between Milton's situation and ours is only a matter of
degree.
Every era has its heresies, and if you don't get imprisoned for them you
will at least get in enough trouble that it becomes a complete
distraction.<br><br>I admit it seems cowardly to keep quiet.
When I read about the harassment to which
the Scientologists subject their critics [12], or that pro-Israel groups
are "compiling dossiers" on those who speak out against Israeli
human rights abuses [13], or about people being sued for
violating the DMCA [14], part of me wants
to say, "All right, you bastards, bring it on."
The problem is, there are so many things you can't say.
If you said them all you'd 
have no time left for your real work.
You'd have to turn into Noam Chomsky.  [15]<br><br>The trouble with keeping your thoughts secret, though,
is that you lose the advantages of discussion.  Talking
about an idea leads to more ideas.
So the optimal plan, if you can manage it,
is to have a few trusted
friends you can speak openly to.  This is not just a
way to develop ideas; it's also a good
rule of thumb for choosing friends.  The people
you can say heretical things to without getting jumped on
are also the most interesting to know.<br><br><b><i>Viso Sciolto?</i></b><br><br>I don't think we need
the <i>viso sciolto</i> so much as the <i>pensieri stretti.</i>
Perhaps the best policy is to make it plain that you don't
agree with whatever zealotry is current in your time, but
not to be too specific about what you disagree with.  Zealots
will try to draw you out, but you don't have to answer them.
If they try to force you to treat a question on their
terms by asking "are you with us or against us?" you can
always just answer "neither".<br><br>Better still, answer "I haven't decided."
That's what Larry Summers
did when a group tried to put
him in this position.  Explaining himself later, he said
"I don't do litmus tests." [16]
A lot of the
questions people get hot about are actually quite complicated.
There is no prize for getting the answer quickly.<br><br>If the anti-yellowists seem to be getting out of hand and
you want to fight back, there are ways
to do it without getting yourself accused of being a
yellowist.  Like skirmishers in
an ancient army, you want to avoid directly engaging the
main body of the enemy's troops.  Better to harass them
with arrows from a distance.<br><br>One way to do this is to ratchet the debate up one level of
abstraction.
If you argue against censorship in general, you can avoid being
accused of whatever heresy is contained
in the book or film that someone is trying to censor.
You can attack labels with meta-labels: labels that refer
to the use of labels to prevent discussion.
The spread of the term "political correctness" meant the beginning of
the end of political correctness, because it enabled one to
attack the phenomenon as a whole without being accused of any
of the specific heresies it sought to suppress.<br><br>Another way to counterattack is with metaphor.  Arthur Miller
undermined the House Un-American Activities Committee
by writing a play, "The Crucible," about the Salem witch trials.
He never referred directly to the committee and so gave them
no way to reply.
What could HUAC do, defend the Salem witch trials?  And yet
Miller's metaphor stuck so well that to this day the activities
of the committee are often described as a "witch-hunt."<br><br>Best of all, probably, is humor.  Zealots, whatever their   
cause, invariably lack a sense of humor.
They can't reply in kind to jokes.
They're as unhappy on the territory of
humor as a mounted knight on a skating rink.
Victorian prudishness, for example, seems to have been defeated
mainly by treating it as a joke.  Likewise its reincarnation as
political correctness.
"I am glad that I
managed to write 'The Crucible,'" Arthur Miller wrote,
"but looking back I have often wished I'd
had the temperament to do an absurd comedy, which is what the
situation deserved." [17]<br><br><b>ABQ</b><br><br>A Dutch friend says
I should use Holland as an example of a tolerant society.
It's true they have a long tradition of
comparative open-mindedness.  For centuries the low countries were the place
to go to say things you couldn't say anywhere else,
and this helped to make the region a center of scholarship and industry
(which have been closely tied for longer than most people realize).
Descartes, though claimed by the French, did much of his thinking in
Holland.<br><br>And yet, I wonder.  The Dutch seem to live their lives up to their
necks in rules and regulations.  There's so much you can't do there;
is there really nothing
you can't say?<br><br>Certainly the fact that they value open-mindedness is no guarantee.
Who thinks they're not open-minded?  Our hypothetical prim miss from
the suburbs thinks she's open-minded.  Hasn't she been
taught to be?  Ask anyone, and they'll say the same thing: they're
pretty open-minded, though they draw the line at things that are really
wrong.  (Some tribes
may avoid "wrong" as
judgemental, and may instead use a more neutral sounding euphemism
like "negative" or "destructive".)<br><br>When people are bad at math, they know it, because they get the
wrong answers on tests.  But when people are bad at open-mindedness
they don't know it.  In fact they tend to think the opposite.
Remember, it's the nature of fashion to be invisible.  It wouldn't
work otherwise.  Fashion doesn't
seem like fashion to someone in the grip of it.  It just seems like
the right thing to do.  It's only by looking from a distance that
we see oscillations in people's idea of the right thing to do, and
can identify them as fashions.<br><br>Time gives us such distance for free.  Indeed, the arrival of new
fashions makes old fashions easy to see, because they
seem so ridiculous by contrast.  From one end of a pendulum's
swing, the other end seems especially far away.<br><br>To see fashion in your own time, though, requires a conscious effort.
Without time to give you distance, you have to create distance yourself.
Instead of being part of the mob, stand
as far away from it as you can and watch what it's
doing.  And pay especially close attention whenever an idea is being
suppressed.  Web filters for children and employees often ban
sites containing pornography, violence, and hate speech.  What
counts as pornography and violence?  And what, exactly, is
"hate speech?" This sounds like a phrase out of <i>1984.</i><br><br>Labels like that are probably the biggest external clue.
If a statement is false,
that's the worst thing you can say about it.  You don't
need to say that it's heretical.  And if it isn't false, it
shouldn't be suppressed.  So when you see statements being
attacked as x-ist or y-ic (substitute your current values of
x and y), whether in 1630 or 2030, that's a sure sign that
something is wrong.  When you hear such labels being used,
ask why.<br><br>Especially if you hear yourself using them.  It's not just
the mob you need to learn to watch from a distance.  You need to be
able to watch your own thoughts from a distance.  That's not
a radical idea, by the way; it's the main difference between
children and adults.  When a child gets angry because he's
tired, he doesn't know what's happening.  An adult can
distance himself enough from the
situation to say "never mind, I'm just tired."  I don't
see why one couldn't, by a similar process, learn to
recognize and discount the effects of moral fashions.<br><br>You have to take that extra step if you want to think clearly.
But it's harder, because now you're working against social customs 
instead of with them.  Everyone encourages you to grow up to the 
point where you can discount your own bad moods.  Few encourage   
you to continue to the point where you can discount society's bad
moods.<br><br>How can you see the wave, when you're the water?  Always be
questioning.  That's the only defence.  What can't you say?  And why?<br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/saynotes.html"><u><b>Notes</b></u></a><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sarah Harlin, Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston,

into computers.  Among programmers it means a good programmer.
But the two meanings are connected.  To programmers,
"hacker" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone
who can make a computer do what he wants—whether the computer
wants to or not.<br><br>To add to the confusion, the noun "hack" also has two senses.  It can
be either a compliment or an insult.  It's called a hack when
you do something in an ugly way.  But when you do something
so clever that you somehow beat the system, that's also
called a hack.  The word is used more often in the former than
the latter sense, probably because ugly solutions are more
common than brilliant ones.<br><br>Believe it or not, the two senses of "hack" are also
connected.  Ugly and imaginative solutions have something in
common: they both break the rules.  And there is a gradual
continuum between rule breaking that's merely ugly (using
duct tape to attach something to your bike) and rule breaking
that is brilliantly imaginative (discarding Euclidean space).<br><br>Hacking predates computers.  When he
was working on the Manhattan Project, Richard Feynman used to
amuse himself by breaking into safes containing secret documents.
This tradition continues today.
When we were in grad school, a hacker friend of mine who spent too much
time around MIT had
his own lock picking kit.
(He now runs a hedge fund, a not unrelated enterprise.)<br><br>It is sometimes hard to explain to authorities why one would
want to do such things.
Another friend of mine once got in trouble with the government for
breaking into computers.  This had only recently been declared
a crime, and the FBI found that their usual investigative
technique didn't work.  Police investigation apparently begins with
a motive.  The usual motives are few: drugs, money, sex,
revenge.  Intellectual curiosity was not one of the motives on
the FBI's list.  Indeed, the whole concept seemed foreign to
them.<br><br>Those in authority tend to be annoyed by hackers'
general attitude of disobedience.  But that disobedience is
a byproduct of the qualities that make them good programmers.
They may laugh at the CEO when he talks in generic corporate
newspeech, but they also laugh at someone who tells them
a certain problem can't be solved.
Suppress one, and you suppress the other.<br><br>This attitude is sometimes affected.  Sometimes young programmers
notice the eccentricities of eminent hackers and decide to
adopt some of their own in order to seem smarter.
The fake version is not merely
annoying; the prickly attitude of these posers
can actually slow the process of innovation.<br><br>But even factoring in their annoying eccentricities,
the disobedient attitude of hackers is a net win.  I wish its
advantages were better understood.<br><br>For example, I suspect people in Hollywood are
simply mystified by
hackers' attitudes toward copyrights.  They are a perennial
topic of heated discussion on Slashdot.
But why should people who program computers
be so concerned about copyrights, of all things?<br><br>Partly because some companies use <i>mechanisms</i> to prevent
copying.  Show any hacker a lock and his first thought is
how to pick it.  But there is a deeper reason that
hackers are alarmed by measures like copyrights and patents.
They see increasingly aggressive measures to protect
"intellectual property"
as a threat to the intellectual
freedom they need to do their job.
And they are right.<br><br>It is by poking about inside current technology that
hackers get ideas for the next generation.  No thanks,
intellectual homeowners may say, we don't need any
outside help.  But they're wrong.
The next generation of computer technology has
often—perhaps more often than not—been developed by outsiders.<br><br>In 1977 there was no doubt some group within IBM developing
what they expected to be
the next generation of business computer.  They were mistaken.
The next generation of business computer was
being developed on entirely different lines by two long-haired
guys called Steve in a <a href="garage.html">garage</a> in Los Altos.  At about the
same time, the powers that be
were cooperating to develop the
official next generation operating system, Multics.
But two guys who thought Multics excessively complex went off
and wrote their own.  They gave it a name that
was a joking reference to Multics: Unix.<br><br>The latest intellectual property laws impose
unprecedented restrictions on the sort of poking around that
leads to new ideas. In the past, a competitor might use patents
to prevent you from selling a copy of something they
made, but they couldn't prevent you from
taking one apart to see how it worked.   The latest
laws make this a crime.  How are we
to develop new technology if we can't study current
technology to figure out how to improve it?<br><br>Ironically, hackers have brought this on themselves.
Computers are responsible for the problem.  The control systems
inside machines used to be physical: gears and levers and cams.
Increasingly, the brains (and thus the value) of products is
in software. And by this I mean software in the general sense:
i.e. data.  A song on an LP is physically stamped into the
plastic.  A song on an iPod's disk is merely stored on it.<br><br>Data is by definition easy to copy.  And the Internet
makes copies easy to distribute.  So it is no wonder
companies are afraid.  But, as so often happens, fear has
clouded their judgement.  The government has responded
with draconian laws to protect intellectual property.
They probably mean well. But
they may not realize that such laws will do more harm
than good.<br><br>Why are programmers so violently opposed to these laws?
If I were a legislator, I'd be interested in this
mystery—for the same reason that, if I were a farmer and suddenly
heard a lot of squawking coming from my hen house one night,
I'd want to go out and investigate.  Hackers are not stupid,
and unanimity is very rare in this world.
So if they're all squawking,   
perhaps there is something amiss.<br><br>Could it be that such laws, though intended to protect America,
will actually harm it?  Think about it.  There is something
very <i>American</i> about Feynman breaking into safes during
the Manhattan Project.  It's hard to imagine the authorities
having a sense of humor about such things over
in Germany at that time.  Maybe it's not a coincidence.<br><br>Hackers are unruly.  That is the essence of hacking.  And it
is also the essence of Americanness.  It is no accident
that Silicon Valley
is in America, and not France, or Germany,
or England, or Japan. In those countries, people color inside
the lines.<br><br>I lived for a while in Florence.  But after I'd been there
a few months I realized that what I'd been unconsciously hoping
to find there was back in the place I'd just left.
The reason Florence is famous is that in 1450, it was New York.
In 1450 it was filled with the kind of turbulent and ambitious
people you find now in America.  (So I went back to America.)<br><br>It is greatly to America's advantage that it is
a congenial atmosphere for the right sort of unruliness—that
it is a home not just for the smart, but for smart-alecks.
And hackers are invariably smart-alecks.  If we had a national
holiday, it would be April 1st.  It says a great deal about
our work that we use the same word for a brilliant or a
horribly cheesy solution.   When we cook one up we're not
always 100% sure which kind it is.  But as long as it has
the right sort of wrongness, that's a promising sign.
It's odd that people
think of programming as precise and methodical.  <i>Computers</i>
are precise and methodical.  Hacking is something you do
with a gleeful laugh.<br><br>In our world some of the most characteristic solutions
are not far removed from practical
jokes.  IBM was no doubt rather surprised by the consequences
of the licensing deal for DOS, just as the hypothetical
"adversary" must be when Michael Rabin solves a problem by
redefining it as one that's easier to solve.<br><br>Smart-alecks have to develop a keen sense of how much they
can <a href="say.html">get away</a> with.  And lately hackers 
have sensed a change
in the atmosphere.
Lately hackerliness seems rather frowned upon.<br><br>To hackers the recent contraction in civil liberties seems
especially ominous.  That must also mystify outsiders. 
Why should we care especially about civil
liberties?  Why programmers, more than
dentists or salesmen or landscapers?<br><br>Let me put the case in terms a government official would appreciate.
Civil liberties are not just an ornament, or a quaint
American tradition.  Civil liberties make countries rich.
If you made a graph of
GNP per capita vs. civil liberties, you'd notice a definite
trend.  Could civil liberties really be a cause, rather
than just an effect?  I think so.  I think a society in which
people can do and say what they want will also tend to
be one in which the most efficient solutions win, rather than
those sponsored by the most influential people.
Authoritarian countries become corrupt;
corrupt countries become poor; and poor countries are weak. 
It seems to me there is
a Laffer curve for government power, just as for
tax revenues.  At least, it seems likely enough that it
would be stupid to try the experiment and find out.  Unlike
high tax rates, you can't repeal totalitarianism if it
turns out to be a mistake.<br><br>This is why hackers worry.  The government spying on people doesn't
literally make programmers write worse code.  It just leads
eventually to a world in which bad ideas win.  And because
this is so important to hackers, they're especially sensitive
to it.  They can sense totalitarianism approaching from a
distance, as animals can sense an approaching  
thunderstorm.<br><br>It would be ironic if, as hackers fear, recent measures
intended to protect national security and intellectual property
turned out to be a missile aimed right at what makes   
America successful.  But it would not be the first time that
measures taken in an atmosphere of panic had
the opposite of the intended effect.<br><br>There is such a thing as Americanness.
There's nothing like living abroad to teach you that.   
And if you want to know whether something will nurture or squash
this quality, it would be hard to find a better focus
group than hackers, because they come closest of any group
I know to embodying it.  Closer, probably,  than
the men running our government,
who for all their talk of patriotism
remind me more of Richelieu or Mazarin
than Thomas Jefferson or George Washington.<br><br>When you read what the founding fathers had to say for
themselves, they sound more like hackers.
"The spirit of resistance to government,"
Jefferson wrote, "is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wish
it always to be kept alive."<br><br>Imagine an American president saying that today.
Like the remarks of an outspoken old grandmother, the sayings of
the founding fathers have embarrassed generations of
their less confident successors.  They remind us where we come from.
They remind us that it is the people who break rules that are
the source of America's wealth and power.<br><br>Those in a position to impose rules naturally want them to be
obeyed.  But be careful what you ask for. You might get it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Ken Anderson, Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Giffin,

(This essay was originally published in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596006624/104-0572701-7443937">Hackers 
&amp; Painters</a>.)
</i><br><br>If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best
bet would be to start or join a startup.  That's been a 
reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years.  The word "startup" 
dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is 
very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the
Middle Ages.<br><br>Startups usually involve technology, so much so that the phrase
"high-tech startup" is almost redundant.  A startup is a small
company that takes on a hard technical problem.<br><br>Lots of people get rich knowing nothing more than that.
You don't have to know physics to be a good pitcher.  But
I think it could give you an edge to understand the underlying principles.
Why do startups have to be small?  
Will a startup inevitably stop being a startup as it
grows larger?  
And why do they so often work on
developing new technology?   Why are there so many startups
selling new drugs or computer software, and none selling corn oil
or laundry detergent?<br><br><b>The Proposition</b><br><br>Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to 
compress your whole working life into a few years.  Instead
of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as
hard as you possibly can for four.  This pays especially well
in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.<br><br>Here is a brief sketch of the economic proposition.  If you're
a good hacker in your mid twenties, you can
get a job paying about $80,000 per year.  So on average 
such a hacker must be
able to do at least $80,000 worth of work per year for the 
company just to break even.  You could probably
work twice as many hours as a corporate employee, and if
you focus you can probably get three times as much done in
an hour. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font>
You should get another multiple of two, at
least, by eliminating the drag 
of the pointy-haired middle
manager who would be your boss in a big company.
Then there is one more multiple: how much smarter are you
than your job description expects you to be?
Suppose another multiple of three.  Combine all these multipliers, and I'm
claiming you could be 36 times more 
productive than you're expected to be in a random corporate
job. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>
  If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a 
big company, then a smart
hacker working very hard without any corporate
bullshit to slow him down should be able to do work worth about
$3 million a year.<br><br>Like all back-of-the-envelope calculations, this one
has a lot of wiggle room.  I wouldn't try to
defend the actual numbers.  But I stand by the 
structure of the calculation.  I'm not claiming
the multiplier is precisely 36, but it is certainly more
than 10, and probably rarely as high as 100.<br><br>If $3 million a year seems
high, remember that we're talking about the limit case:
the case where you not only have zero leisure time
but indeed work so hard that you endanger your health.<br><br>Startups are not magic.  They don't change the laws of
wealth creation.  They just represent a point at the far end of the curve.
There is a conservation law at work here: if
you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a 
million dollars' worth of pain.  
For example, one way to
make a million dollars would be to work for the 
Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your 
salary.  Imagine the stress of working for the Post 
Office for fifty years.   In a startup you compress all
this stress into three or four years.  You do tend to get a 
certain 
bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain,
but you can't evade the fundamental conservation law.
If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it.<br><br><b>Millions, not Billions</b><br><br>If $3 million a year seems high to some people, it will seem
low to others.  Three <i>million?</i> 
How do I get to be a billionaire, like Bill Gates?<br><br>So let's get Bill Gates out of the way right now.  It's not
a good idea to use famous rich people 
as examples, because the press only 
write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers.
Bill Gates is a smart, determined, and hardworking man,
but you need more than
that to make as much money as he has.  You also need to be
very lucky.<br><br>There is a large random
factor in the success of any company.  So the guys you end 
up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very 
smart, totally dedicated, <i>and</i> win the lottery.
Certainly Bill is smart and dedicated, but Microsoft also 
happens to have been the beneficiary of one of the most spectacular
blunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for
DOS.  No doubt Bill did 
everything he could to steer IBM into making that blunder, 
and he has done an excellent job of exploiting it, but if
there had been one person with a brain on IBM's side,
Microsoft's future would have been very different.
Microsoft at that stage had little leverage over IBM.
They were effectively a component supplier.  If IBM had 
required an exclusive license, as they should have, Microsoft
would still have signed the deal.  It would still have
meant a lot of money for them,  and IBM
could easily have gotten an operating system elsewhere.<br><br>Instead IBM ended up using all its power in the market
to give Microsoft control of the PC standard.  From 
that point, all Microsoft had to do was execute.  They
never had to bet the company on a bold decision.  All they
had to do was play hardball with licensees and copy more
innovative products reasonably promptly.<br><br>If IBM hadn't made this mistake, Microsoft would
still have been a successful company, but it
could not have grown so big so fast. 
Bill Gates would be rich, but he'd be somewhere
near the bottom of the Forbes 400 with the other guys his age.<br><br>There are a lot of ways to get
rich, and this essay is about only one of them.  This
essay is about how to make money by creating wealth and
getting paid for it.  There are plenty of other ways to 
get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance, 
theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly,
graft, lobbying,
counterfeiting, and prospecting.  Most of the greatest fortunes
have probably involved several of these.<br><br>The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich,
is not just that it's more legitimate 
(many of the other methods are now illegal) 
but that it's more
<i>straightforward.</i>  You just have to do something people want.<br><br><b>Money Is Not Wealth</b><br><br>If you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is.  
Wealth is not the same thing as money. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
  Wealth is as old as
human history.  Far older, in fact; ants have wealth. 
Money is a comparatively recent invention.<br><br>Wealth is the fundamental thing.  Wealth is stuff we want: food, 
clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places,
and so on.  You can have wealth without
having money.  If you had a magic machine that
could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your
laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn't need money.
Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is
nothing to buy, it wouldn't matter how much money you had.<br><br>Wealth is what you want, not money.  But if wealth is the important
thing, why does everyone talk about making money?   It is
a kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving wealth, and in practice
they are usually interchangeable.  But they are not the same thing,
and unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting, talking about
<i>making money</i> can make it harder to understand how to 
make money.<br><br>Money is a side effect of specialization.
In a specialized society, most of the
things you need, you can't make for yourself.  If you want a potato
or a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someone
else.<br><br>How do you get the person who grows the potatoes to give you some?
By giving him something he wants in return.  But you can't get
very far by trading things directly with the people who
need them.  If you make violins, and none of the local
farmers wants one, how will you eat?<br><br>The solution societies find, as they get more specialized, is to
make the trade into a two-step process.  Instead of trading violins
directly for potatoes, you trade violins for, say, silver, 
which you can then trade again for anything else you need.  The
intermediate stuff-- the <i>medium of exchange</i>-- can be anything that's
rare and portable.  Historically metals have been the most common,
but recently we've been using a medium of exchange, called the <i>dollar</i>,
that doesn't physically exist.  It works as a medium of exchange,
however, because its rarity 
is guaranteed by the U.S. Government.<br><br>The advantage of a medium of exchange is that it makes trade work.
The disadvantage is that it tends to obscure what trade really
means.  People think that what a business does is make money.
But money is just the intermediate stage-- just
a shorthand-- for whatever people want.
What most businesses really do is make  
wealth.  They do something people want. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>The Pie Fallacy</b><br><br>A surprising number of people retain from childhood the idea
that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world. 
There is, in any normal family, a fixed amount of <i>money</i> at 
any moment.  But that's not the same thing.<br><br>When wealth is talked about in this context, it is often
described as a pie.  "You can't make the pie larger,"
say politicians.
When you're
talking about the amount of money in one family's bank
account, or the amount available to a government from one
year's tax revenue, this is true.  
If one person gets more, someone else has to get less.<br><br>I can remember believing, as a child, that if a few
rich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else.
Many people seem to continue to believe something like this
well into adulthood.  This fallacy is usually there in the 
background when you hear someone talking about how x percent
of the population have y percent of the wealth.  If you plan
to start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you're
planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.<br><br>What leads people astray here is the abstraction of
money.  Money is not wealth.  It's
just something we use to move wealth around.
So although there may be, in certain specific moments (like
your family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to
trade with other people for things you want,
there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world.  
<i>You can make more wealth.</i>  Wealth has been getting created and
destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.<br><br>Suppose you own a beat-up old car. 
Instead of sitting on your butt next
summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition.
In doing so you create wealth.  The world is-- and
you specifically are-- one pristine old car the richer.  And not
just in some metaphorical way.  If you sell your car,
you'll get more for it.<br><br>In restoring your old car you have made yourself
richer.  You haven't made anyone else poorer.  So there is
obviously not a fixed pie.  And in fact, when you look at 
it this way, you wonder why anyone would think there was. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Kids know, without knowing they know, that they can create
wealth.  If you need to give someone a present and don't
have any money, you make one.  But kids are so bad at making
things that they consider home-made presents to be a distinct,
inferior, sort of thing to store-bought ones-- a mere expression
of the proverbial thought that counts. 
And indeed, the lumpy ashtrays
we made for our parents did not have much of a resale market.<br><br><b>Craftsmen</b><br><br>The people most likely to grasp that wealth can be
created are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen.
Their hand-made objects become store-bought ones. 
But with the rise of industrialization there are fewer and
fewer craftsmen.  One of the biggest remaining groups  is
computer programmers.<br><br>A programmer can sit down in front of a computer and
<i>create wealth</i>.  A good piece of software is, in itself, 
a valuable thing.
There is no manufacturing to confuse the issue.  Those
characters you type 
are a complete, finished product.
If someone sat down and wrote a web
browser that didn't suck (a fine idea, by the way), the world
would be that much richer.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5bn"><font color="#777777">5b</font></a>]</font><br><br>Everyone in a company works together to create
wealth, in the sense of making more things people want.
Many of the employees (e.g. the people in the mailroom or
the personnel department) work at one remove from the 
actual making of stuff.  Not the programmers.  They
literally think the product, one line at a time.
And so it's clearer to programmers that wealth is something
that's made, rather than being distributed, like slices of a
pie, by some imaginary Daddy.<br><br>It's also obvious to programmers that there are huge variations
in the rate at which wealth is created.  At Viaweb we had one
programmer who was a sort of monster of productivity.  
I remember watching what he did one long day and estimating that
he had added several hundred thousand dollars
to the market value of the company. 
A great programmer, on a roll, could 
create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks.
A mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero or
even negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs).<br><br>This is
why so many of the best programmers are libertarians.
In our world, you sink or swim, and there are no excuses.
When those far removed from the creation of wealth-- undergraduates,
reporters, politicians-- hear
that the richest 5% of the people have 
half the total wealth, they tend to think <i>injustice!</i>
An experienced programmer would be more likely to think
<i>is that all?</i>  The top 5% of programmers
probably write 99% of the good software.<br><br>Wealth can be created without being sold.  Scientists, till
recently at least, effectively donated the wealth they 
created.  We are all richer for knowing about penicillin,
because we're less likely to die from infections.  Wealth
is whatever people want, and not dying is certainly something
we want.  Hackers often donate their work by 
writing open source software that anyone can use for free.
I am much the richer for the operating system
FreeBSD, which I'm running on the computer I'm using now,
and so is Yahoo, which runs it on all their servers.<br><br><b>What a Job Is</b><br><br>In industrialized countries, people belong to one institution or
another at least until their twenties.  After all those years you get
used to the idea of belonging to a group of people who all get up
in the morning, go to some set of buildings, and do things that they
do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing.  Belonging to such a group becomes
part of your identity: name, age, role, institution.
If you have to introduce yourself, or
someone else describes you, it will be as something like, John
Smith, age 10, a student at such and such elementary school, or
John Smith, age 20, a student at such and such college.<br><br>When John Smith finishes school he is expected to get a job.  And
what getting a job seems to mean is joining another institution.
Superficially it's a lot like college.  You pick the companies you
want to work for and apply to join them.  If one likes you, you
become a member of this new group.  You get up in the morning and
go to a new set of buildings, and do things that you do not, ordinarily,
enjoy doing.  There are a few differences: life is not as much fun,
and you get paid, instead of paying, as you did in college.  But
the similarities feel greater than the differences.  John Smith is
now John Smith, 22, a software developer at such and such corporation.<br><br>In fact John Smith's
life has changed more than he realizes.  Socially, a company
looks much like college, but the deeper you go into the
underlying reality, the more different it gets.<br><br>What a company does, and has to do if it wants to continue to
exist, is earn money.  And the way most companies make money
is by creating wealth.  Companies can be so specialized that this
similarity is concealed, but it is not only manufacturing 
companies that create wealth.  A big component of wealth is
location. 
Remember that magic machine that could
make you cars and cook you dinner and so on?  It would not be
so useful if it delivered your dinner to a random location
in central Asia.  
If wealth means what people want, companies that move
things also create wealth.  Ditto for
many other kinds of companies that don't make anything
physical.  Nearly all companies exist to do something people
want.<br><br>And that's what you do, as well, when you go to work for a company.
But here there is another layer that tends to obscure the underlying
reality.  In a company, the work you do is averaged together with
a lot of other people's.  
You may not even be aware you're doing something people
want.  Your contribution may be indirect.  But the company as a
whole must be giving people something they want, or they won't make
any money.  And if they are paying you x dollars a year, then on
average you must be contributing at least x dollars a year worth
of work, or the company will be spending more than it makes,
and will go out of business.<br><br>Someone graduating from college thinks, and is told, that he needs
to get a job, as if the important thing were becoming a member of 
an institution.  A more direct way to put it would be: you need to
start doing something people want.  You don't
need to
join a company to do that.  All a company is is a group of people
working together to do something people want.  It's doing something people
want that matters, not joining the group. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>For most people the   
best plan probably is to go to work for some existing
company.  But it is a good idea to understand what's happening   
when you do this.  A job means doing something people want,
averaged together with everyone else in that company.<br><br><b>Working Harder</b><br><br>That averaging gets to be a problem.
I think the single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the   
difficulty of assigning a value to each person's work. 
For the most part they punt.  In a
big company you get paid a fairly predictable salary for working 
fairly hard.  You're expected not to be obviously incompetent or
lazy, but you're not expected to devote your whole life to your
work.<br><br>It turns out, though, that there are economies of scale in how much of your
life you devote to your work.  In the right kind of business,  
someone who really devoted himself to work could generate ten or
even a hundred times as much wealth as an average
employee.  A programmer, for example, instead of chugging along
maintaining and updating an existing piece of software, could write
a whole new piece of software, and with it create a new source of
revenue.<br><br>Companies are not set up to reward people who want to do this. 
You can't go to your boss and say, I'd like to start working ten
times as hard, so will you please pay me ten times as much? For
one thing, the official fiction is that you are already working as
hard as you can.  But a more serious problem is that the company
has no way of measuring the value of your work.<br><br>Salesmen are an exception.  It's easy 
to measure how much revenue they generate, and they're
usually paid a percentage of it.  If a salesman wants to work harder,
he can just start doing it, and he will automatically
get paid proportionally more.<br><br>There is one other job besides sales where big companies can
hire first-rate people: in the top management jobs. 
And for the same reason: their performance can
be measured.  The top managers are
held responsible for the performance of the entire company.
Because an ordinary employee's performance can't usually
be measured, he is not expected to do
more than put in a solid effort.  Whereas top management, like
salespeople, have to actually come up with the numbers.
The CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in  
a solid effort.  If the company does badly, he's done badly.<br><br>A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly   
would be enormously successful.  Many employees would work harder
if they could get paid for it.  More importantly,
such a company would attract people who wanted to work
especially hard. 
It would crush its competitors.<br><br>Unfortunately, companies can't pay everyone like salesmen.  Salesmen
work alone.  Most employees' work is tangled together.  Suppose
a company makes some kind of consumer gadget.  The 
engineers build a reliable gadget with all kinds of new features;
the industrial designers design a beautiful case for it; and then
the marketing people convince everyone that
it's something they've got to have.  How do you know how much of the
gadget's sales are due to each group's efforts?  Or, for that
matter, how much is due to the creators of past gadgets that gave
the company a reputation for quality?  There's no way to  
untangle all their contributions.  Even if you could read the minds
of the consumers, you'd find these factors were all blurred together.<br><br>If you want to go faster, it's a problem to have your work
tangled together with a large number of other people's.  In a  
large group, your performance is not separately measurable-- and 
the rest of the group slows you down.<br><br><b>Measurement and Leverage</b><br><br>To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two
things, measurement and leverage.  You need to be in a
position where your performance can be measured, or there is
no way to get paid more by doing more.  And you have to
have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have   
a big effect.<br><br>Measurement alone is not enough.  An example of a job with
measurement but not leverage is doing piecework in a
sweatshop.  Your performance is measured and you get paid  
accordingly, but you have no scope for decisions.  The only
decision you get to make is how fast you work, and that
can probably only increase your earnings by a factor
of two or three.<br><br>An example of a job with both measurement and leverage would
be lead actor in a movie.  Your performance can be measured in the
gross of the movie.  And you have leverage in the sense that your
performance can make or break it.<br><br>CEOs also have both measurement and leverage.  They're measured,
in that the performance of the company is their performance.
And they have leverage in that their decisions
set the whole company moving in one direction or another.<br><br>I think everyone who gets rich by their own efforts will be
found to be in a situation with measurement and leverage.    
Everyone I can think of does: CEOs, movie stars, 
hedge fund managers, professional athletes.  A good hint to the
presence of leverage is the possibility of failure.
Upside must be balanced by downside, so if there is 
big potential for gain there must also be a terrifying
possibility of loss.  CEOs, stars, fund managers, and athletes
all live with the sword hanging over their heads;
the moment they start to suck, they're out.  If you're in
a job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich,
because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage.<br><br>But you don't have to become a CEO or a movie star to
be in a situation with measurement and leverage.  All you        
need to do is be part of a small group working on a
hard problem.<br><br><b>Smallness = Measurement</b><br><br>If you can't measure the value of the work done by individual  
employees, you can get close.  You can measure the value
of the work done by small groups.<br><br>One level at which you can accurately measure the revenue
generated by employees is at the level of the whole company.   
When the company is small, you are thereby fairly close to 
measuring the contributions of individual employees.  A viable
startup might only have ten employees, which puts you within a
factor of ten of measuring individual effort.<br><br>Starting or joining a startup is thus as close as most
people can get to saying to one's boss, I want to work ten times
as hard, so please pay me ten times as much.  There are two
differences: you're not saying it to your boss, but directly to the
customers (for whom your boss is only a proxy after all), and
you're not doing it individually, but along with a small group
of other ambitious people.<br><br>It will, ordinarily, be a group.  Except in a few unusual kinds
of work, like acting or writing books, you can't be a company 
of one person.  
And the people you work with had better be good, because it's their work that
yours is going to be averaged with.<br><br>A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers.
Two things keep the speed of the
galley down.  One is that individual rowers don't see any
result from working harder. 
The other is that, in a group of a
thousand people, the average rower is likely  to be
pretty average.<br><br>If you took ten people at random out of the big galley and
put them in a boat by themselves, they could probably go  
faster.  They would have both carrot and stick to motivate   
them.  An energetic rower would be encouraged by the thought
that he could have a visible effect on the speed of
the boat.  And if someone was lazy, the others would be more likely
to notice and complain.<br><br>But the real advantage of the ten-man boat shows when 
you take the ten <i>best</i> rowers out of the big galley
and put them in a boat together.  They will have all
the extra motivation that comes from being in a small group.
But more importantly, by selecting that small a group
you can get the best rowers.  Each one will be in
the top 1%.  It's a much better deal for them to average  
their work together with a small group of their peers than to    
average it with everyone.<br><br>That's the real point of startups.  Ideally, you are getting
together with a group of other people who also want to work
a lot harder, and get paid a lot more, than they would in
a big company.  And because startups tend to get founded 
by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already 
know one another (at least by reputation), the level of 
measurement is more precise than you get from smallness alone.
A startup is not merely ten people, but ten people like you.<br><br>Steve Jobs once said that the success or failure of a startup
depends on the first ten employees.  I agree. If 
anything, it's more like the first five.
Being small is not, in itself, what makes startups kick butt,   
but rather that small groups can be select.
You don't want small in the sense of a
village, but small in the sense of an all-star team.<br><br>The larger a group, the closer its average member will be to the average
for the population as a whole.   So all other things being
equal, a very able person in a big company is probably
getting a bad deal, because his performance is dragged down by
the overall lower performance of the others.  Of course,
all other things often are not equal: the able person may 
not care about money, or may prefer the stability of a large
company.  But a very able person who does care about money
will ordinarily do better to go off and work with a small
group of peers.<br><br><b>Technology = Leverage</b><br><br>Startups offer anyone a way to be in a situation with
measurement and leverage.
They allow measurement because they're small,
and they offer leverage because they
make money by inventing new technology.<br><br>What is technology?  It's <i>technique</i>. It's the way  
we all do things.  And when
you discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied
by all the people who use it.  It is the proverbial fishing
rod, rather than the fish.  That's the difference between a
startup and a restaurant or a barber shop.  You fry eggs or cut 
hair one customer at a time.  Whereas if 
you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about,
you help everyone who uses your solution.  
That's leverage.<br><br>If you look at history, it seems that most people
who got rich by creating wealth did it by developing
new technology.  You just can't fry eggs or cut hair fast enough.
What made the Florentines rich in 1200 
was the discovery of new techniques for making the high-tech 
product of the time, fine woven cloth.  What made the
Dutch rich in 1600 was the discovery of shipbuilding and
navigation techniques that enabled them to dominate the seas
of the Far East.<br><br>Fortunately there is a natural fit between smallness and
solving hard problems.  The leading edge of technology moves
fast.  Technology that's valuable today could be worthless
in a couple years.  Small companies are more at home in this
world, because they don't have layers of bureaucracy to
slow them down.
Also, technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches,
and small companies are less constrained by convention.<br><br>Big companies can develop technology.  They just can't do it
quickly.  Their size makes them slow and prevents
them from rewarding employees for the extraordinary
effort required.  So in practice big companies only get to develop 
technology in fields where large capital requirements prevent startups from
competing with them, like microprocessors, power plants, 
or passenger aircraft.  And even in those fields they depend heavily
on startups for components and ideas.<br><br>It's obvious that biotech or software startups exist to solve
hard technical problems, but 
I think it will also be found to be true 
in businesses that don't seem to be about technology.  McDonald's,
for example, grew big by designing a system, the McDonald's 
franchise, that could then be reproduced at will all over the 
face of the earth.  A McDonald's franchise is controlled by rules
so precise that it is practically
a piece of software.  Write once, run everywhere.
Ditto for Wal-Mart.  Sam Walton got rich not by being a 
retailer, but by designing a new kind of store.<br><br>Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall
aim of your company, but also at decision points along the way.
At Viaweb one of our rules of thumb was <i>run upstairs.</i>
Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big,
fat, bully.  You open a door and find yourself in a    
staircase.  Do you go up or down?  I say up.  The
bully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can.
Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage.
Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him.<br><br>What this meant in practice was that we deliberately sought      
hard problems.  If there were two features we could add to our
software, both equally valuable in proportion to their difficulty,
we'd always take the harder one.  Not just because it was 
more valuable, but <i>because it was harder.</i>
We delighted in forcing bigger, slower competitors
to follow us over difficult ground.
Like guerillas, startups prefer the difficult terrain of the
mountains, where the troops of the central government
can't follow.  I can remember times when we were just
exhausted after wrestling all day with some horrible technical
problem.  And I'd be delighted, because something that was 
hard for us would be impossible for our competitors.<br><br>This is not just a good way to run a startup.  It's what
a startup is.
Venture capitalists know about this and have a phrase for it:
<i>barriers to entry.</i>  If you go to a VC with a new 
idea and ask him to invest in it, one of the first things
he'll ask is, how hard would this be for someone else to  
develop?  That is, how much difficult ground
have you put between yourself and potential pursuers? 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font>
And you had better have a convincing explanation of why 
your technology would be hard to duplicate.  Otherwise as
soon as some big company becomes aware of it, they'll make
their own, and with their brand name, capital, and
distribution clout, they'll take away your market overnight.
You'd be like guerillas caught in the open field by regular
army forces.<br><br>One way to put up barriers to entry is through patents. 
But patents may not provide much protection. 
Competitors commonly find ways to work around a patent.
And if they can't, they 
may simply violate it and invite you to sue them.
A big company is not afraid to be sued; it's an everyday thing
for them.  They'll make sure that suing them is expensive and
takes a long time.
Ever heard of Philo Farnsworth?  He invented
television.  The reason you've never
heard of him is that his company was not the one to make
money from it. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font>
The company that did was RCA, and
Farnsworth's reward for his efforts was a decade of
patent litigation.<br><br>Here, as so often, the best defense is a good offense.  If
you can develop technology that's simply too hard for
competitors to duplicate, you don't need to rely on other
defenses.  Start by picking a hard problem, and
then at every decision point, take the harder choice. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>The Catch(es)</b><br><br>If it were simply a matter of working harder than 
an ordinary employee and getting paid proportionately, it would
obviously be a good deal to start a startup.  Up to a point it
would be more fun. I don't think many people 
like the slow pace of big companies, the interminable meetings,
the water-cooler conversations, the clueless middle managers,
and so on.<br><br>Unfortunately there are a couple catches.  One is that you
can't choose the point on the curve that you want to inhabit.
You can't decide, for example, that you'd like to work just
two or three times as hard, and get paid that much more.  When
you're running a startup, your competitors decide how
hard you work.  And they pretty much all make the same decision:
as hard as you possibly can.<br><br>The other catch is that the payoff is only on average proportionate
to your productivity.  There is, as I said before, a large
random multiplier in the success of any company.  So in
practice the deal is not that you're 30 times as productive and get 
paid 30 times as much.  It is that you're 30 times as productive,
and get paid between zero and a thousand times as much.
If the mean is 30x, the median is probably zero.
Most startups tank, and not just the dogfood 
portals we all heard about during
the Internet Bubble.  It's common for a startup
to be developing a genuinely good product, take slightly
too long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut down.<br><br>A startup is like a mosquito.  A bear can absorb a hit and a crab
is armored against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing:
to score.  No energy is wasted on defense.  The defense of mosquitos, 
as a species, is that there are a lot of them, but this is little 
consolation to the individual mosquito.<br><br>Startups, like mosquitos, tend to be an all-or-nothing proposition.
And you don't generally know which of the two you're going to
get till the last minute. 
Viaweb came close to tanking several times. Our trajectory
was like a sine wave.  Fortunately we got bought at
the top of the cycle, but it was damned close.   While we were
visiting Yahoo in California to talk about selling the company
to them, we had to borrow a conference room to reassure
an investor who was about to back out of a new round of funding 
that we needed to stay alive.<br><br>The all-or-nothing aspect of startups was not something we wanted.
Viaweb's hackers were all extremely risk-averse.
If there had been some way just to work super hard and get
paid for it, without having a lottery mixed in, we would have
been delighted.  We would have much preferred a 100% chance of
$1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, even though 
theoretically the second is worth twice as much.   Unfortunately,
there is not currently any space in the business world where
you can get the first deal.<br><br>The closest you can get is by
selling your startup in the early stages, giving up upside  
(and risk) for a smaller but guaranteed payoff.  We had a 
chance to do this, and stupidly, as we then thought, let it slip by.
After that we became comically eager to sell.
For the next year or so,
if anyone expressed the slightest curiosity about Viaweb
we would try to sell them the company.  But there were no takers,
so we had to keep going.<br><br>It would have been a bargain to 
buy us at an early stage, but companies doing acquisitions are not
looking for bargains.  A company big enough to acquire 
startups will be big enough to be fairly conservative, and 
within the company the people in charge of acquisitions will
be among the more conservative, because they are likely to be
business school types who joined the company late.  
They would rather overpay for a safe choice.  So
it is easier to sell an established startup, even at a large
premium, than an early-stage one.<br><br><b>Get Users</b><br><br>I think it's a good idea to get bought, if you can.  Running a
business is different from growing one.
It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach 
cruising altitude.  It's
also financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify.
What would you think of a financial advisor who put all his
client's assets into one volatile stock?<br><br>How do you get bought?  Mostly by doing the same things 
you'd do if you didn't intend to sell the company.  Being 
profitable, for example.   But getting bought is also an art
in its own right, and one that we spent a lot of time trying
to master.<br><br>Potential buyers will
always delay if they can.  The hard part about getting
bought is getting them to act.  For most people, the most powerful motivator
is not the hope of gain, but the fear of loss.  For potential
acquirers, the most powerful motivator is the prospect that 
one of their competitors will buy you.  This, as we found, 
causes CEOs to take red-eyes.  
The second biggest is the worry that, if they don't buy you 
now, you'll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more to
acquire later, or even become a competitor.<br><br>In both cases, what it all comes down to is users.  
You'd think that a company about to buy you would do a lot of
research and decide for themselves how valuable your technology
was.  Not at all.  What they go by is the number of users you
have.<br><br>In effect, acquirers assume the customers know who has the
best technology.  And this is not as stupid as it sounds.  Users 
are the only real proof that you've created wealth.  Wealth is 
what people want, and if people aren't using your software,
maybe it's not just because you're bad at marketing.  Maybe it's
because you haven't made what they want.<br><br>Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch out for.
Near the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are 
obsessed with solving interesting technical problems, instead
of making users happy.  In a startup, you're not just trying to
solve problems.  You're trying to solve problems <i>that 
users care about.</i><br><br>So I think you should make users the test, just as 
acquirers do.  Treat a startup as an optimization problem 
in which performance is measured by number of users.  As anyone
who has tried to optimize software knows, the key is measurement.
When you try to guess where your program is slow, and what would
make it faster, you almost always guess wrong.<br><br>Number of users may not be the perfect test, but it will 
be very close.  It's what acquirers care about.  It's what 
revenues depend on.  
It's what makes competitors unhappy.
It's what impresses reporters, and potential
new users.  Certainly it's a better test than your a priori
notions of what problems are important to solve, no matter how
technically adept you are.<br><br>Among other things, treating a startup as an optimization
problem will help you avoid another
pitfall that VCs worry about, and rightly-- taking a long time
to develop a product.  Now we can recognize this as something
hackers already know to avoid: premature optimization.  Get a version 
1.0 out there as soon as you can.  Until you have some users to
measure, you're optimizing based on guesses.<br><br>The ball you need to keep your eye on here is the underlying
principle that wealth is what people want.  If you plan to get 
rich by creating wealth, you have to know what people want.  
So few businesses really pay attention to making customers happy.
How often do you walk into a store, or call a company on the
phone, with a feeling of dread in the back of your mind?
When you hear "your call is important to us, please stay on
the line," do you think, oh good, now everything will be all right?<br><br>A restaurant can afford to serve the occasional burnt dinner.
But in technology, you cook one thing and that's what everyone
eats.  So any difference between what people want and what
you deliver is multiplied.  
You please or annoy
customers wholesale.  The closer you can get to what they want,
the more wealth you generate.<br><br><b>Wealth and Power</b><br><br>Making wealth is not the only way to get rich.  For most of
human history it has not even been the most common.  Until
a few centuries ago,
the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs,
land, and cattle,
and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance,
marriage, conquest, or confiscation.  
Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.<br><br>Two things changed.  The first was the rule of law.  For most of the world's
history, if you did somehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his 
henchmen 
would find a way to steal it.
But in medieval Europe something new happened.
A new class of merchants and manufacturers
began to collect in towns. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#777777">10</font></a>]</font>
Together they were able to withstand the local feudal
lord.  So 
for the first time in our history, the bullies stopped stealing the
nerds' lunch money.
This was naturally a great incentive,
and possibly indeed the main cause of the second big change,
industrialization.<br><br>A great deal has been written about the causes of the Industrial 
Revolution.  But surely a necessary, if not sufficient, condition
was that people who made fortunes be able to enjoy them in peace.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#777777">11</font></a>]</font>
One piece of evidence is what happened to countries
that tried to return to the old model, like the Soviet
Union, and to a lesser extent Britain under the labor
governments of the 1960s and early 1970s.  Take away the incentive
of wealth, and technical innovation grinds to a halt.<br><br>Remember what a startup is, economically: 
a way of saying, I want to work faster.  Instead of accumulating
money slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I 
want to get it over with as soon as possible.  So governments
that forbid you to accumulate wealth are in effect decreeing
that you work slowly.  They're willing to let you earn $3 million over
fifty years, but they're not willing to let you work so hard that
you can do it in two.  They are like
the corporate boss that you can't go to and say, I want to work
ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times a much.
Except this is not a boss you can escape by starting your own
company.<br><br>The problem with working slowly is not just that technical
innovation happens slowly.  It's that it tends not to happen at all.
It's only when you're deliberately looking for hard problems,
as a way to use speed to the greatest advantage, that you take
on this kind of project.  Developing new technology is a 
pain in the ass. It is, as Edison said, one percent 
inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.  
Without the incentive of wealth, no one wants to do it.
Engineers will work on sexy projects like fighter planes and moon
rockets for ordinary salaries, but more mundane technologies
like light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs.<br><br>Startups
are not just something that happened in Silicon Valley in 
the last couple decades.  Since it became possible to
get rich by creating wealth, everyone who has done it has
used essentially the same recipe: measurement and leverage,
where measurement comes from working with a small
group, and leverage from developing new techniques.
The recipe was the same in Florence in 1200 as it is 
in Santa Clara today.<br><br>Understanding this may help to answer an important question:
why Europe grew so powerful.
Was it something about the geography of 
Europe?  Was it that Europeans are somehow racially superior?
Was it their religion?  The answer (or at least
the proximate cause) may be that the
Europeans 
rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who
made a lot of money to keep it.<br><br>Once you're allowed to do that, 
people who want to get rich can do it by generating
wealth instead of stealing it.
The resulting technological growth translates not only 
into wealth but into military power.  The theory that led to
the stealth plane was developed by a Soviet mathematician.
But because the Soviet Union didn't have a computer industry,
it remained for them a theory;
they didn't have hardware capable of executing the calculations
fast enough to design an actual airplane.<br><br>In that respect the Cold War teaches the same lesson as
World War II and, for that matter, most wars in recent history.
Don't let a ruling
class of warriors and politicians squash the entrepreneurs.
The same recipe that makes individuals rich
makes countries powerful.  Let the nerds keep their lunch
money, and you rule the world.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
One valuable thing you tend to get only in startups is
<i>uninterruptability</i>.  Different kinds of
work have different time quanta.  Someone proofreading a
manuscript
could probably be interrupted every fifteen minutes
with little loss of productivity.  But the time quantum for
hacking is very long: it might take an hour just to load
a problem into your head.  So the
cost of having someone from personnel
call you about a form you forgot to fill out can be huge.<br><br>This is why hackers give you such a baleful stare as they
turn from their screen to answer your question.  Inside
their heads a giant house of cards is tottering.<br><br>The mere possibility of being interrupted deters hackers
from starting hard projects.  This is why they
tend to work late at night, and why it's next to impossible
to write great software in a cubicle (except late at night).<br><br>One great advantage of startups is that they don't yet have
any of the people who interrupt you.  There is no personnel
department, and thus no form nor anyone to call you about it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Faced with the idea that people working for startups might be
20 or 30 times as productive as those working for large companies,
executives at large companies will naturally wonder, how could
I get the people working for me to do that?  The answer is
simple: pay them to.<br><br>Internally most companies are run like Communist states.
If you believe in free markets, why not turn your company into one?<br><br>Hypothesis: A company will be maximally profitable when each
employee is paid in proportion to the wealth they generate.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Until recently even governments sometimes didn't grasp the
distinction between money and wealth.  Adam
Smith (<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, v:i) mentions several
that tried to preserve their
"wealth" by forbidding the export of gold or silver.
But having more of the medium of exchange would not make
a country richer; if you have more money chasing the same
amount of material wealth, the only result is higher prices.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
There are many senses of the word "wealth," not all of
them material.  I'm not trying to make a deep philosophical
point here about which
is the true kind.  I'm writing about one specific,
rather technical sense of the word "wealth."  What
people will give you money for.
This is an interesting sort of wealth to study, because
it is the kind that prevents you from starving.
And what people will give you money for depends on them,
not you.<br><br>When you're starting a business,
it's easy to slide into thinking that customers
want what you do.  During the Internet Bubble I talked
to a woman who, because she liked the outdoors, was
starting an "outdoor portal." You know what
kind of business you should start if you like
the outdoors?  One to recover data from crashed hard disks.<br><br>What's the connection?  None at all.  Which is precisely my point.
If you want
to create wealth (in the narrow technical sense of not
starving) then you should be especially skeptical about any
plan that centers on things you like doing.
That is where your idea of what's valuable is least
likely to coincide with other people's.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
In the average car restoration you probably do make everyone
else microscopically poorer, by doing a small amount of damage to
the environment.  While environmental costs should be taken
into account, they don't
make wealth a zero-sum game.  For example, if you repair
a machine that's broken because a part has come unscrewed,
you create wealth with no environmental cost.<br><br>[<a name="f5bn"><font color="#000000">5b</font></a>]
This essay was written before Firefox.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Many people feel confused and depressed in
their early twenties.  Life seemed so much more fun in college.
Well, of course it was.  Don't be fooled by the surface similarities.
You've gone from guest to servant.
It's possible to have fun in this new world. 
Among other things, you now get to go behind the doors that say
"authorized personnel only."
But the change is a shock at first, and all the worse
if you're not consciously aware of it.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
When VCs asked us how long it would take another startup
to duplicate our software, we used to reply that they probably
wouldn't be able to at all. I think this made us seem naive,
or liars.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Few technologies have one clear inventor.  So as
a rule, if you know the "inventor" of something
(the telephone, the assembly line, the airplane, 
the light bulb, the transistor) it is because their
company made money from it, and the company's PR people worked
hard to spread the story.  If you don't know who invented
something (the automobile, the television, the computer,
the jet engine, the laser), it's because other companies
made all the money.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
This is a good plan for life in general.
If you have two choices, choose the harder.
If you're trying to decide whether to go out running or
sit home and watch TV, go running.
Probably the reason this trick works so well is that
when you have two choices and one is harder, the
only reason you're even considering the other is laziness.
You know in the back of your mind what's the right thing
to do, and this trick merely forces you to acknowledge it.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
It is probably no accident that the middle class
first appeared in northern Italy and the low countries,
where there were no strong central governments.   These two
regions were the richest of their time and became the twin
centers from which Renaissance civilization radiated.
If they no longer play that role, it is because
other places, like the United States, have been truer to the
principles they discovered.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
It may indeed be a sufficient condition.  But if so, why didn't
the Industrial Revolution happen earlier?  Two possible (and
not incompatible) answers: (a) It did.  
The Industrial Revolution was one in a series.
(b) Because in medieval towns, monopolies
and guild regulations initially slowed the development of new means
of production.<br><br><a href="http://reddit.com"><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/0f994f8dada972cb7d444e80cdecbc7d.png" border="0"></a>

do it best tend to be far better than everyone else.  There's a
huge gap between Leonardo and second-rate contemporaries like
Borgognone.  You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the
average writer of detective novels.  A top-ranked professional chess
player could play ten thousand games against an ordinary club player
without losing once.<br><br>Like chess or painting or writing novels, making money is a very
specialized skill.   But for some reason we treat this skill
differently.  No one complains when a few people surpass all the
rest at playing chess or writing novels, but when a few people make
more money than the rest, we get editorials saying this is wrong.<br><br>Why?  The pattern of variation seems no different than for any other
skill.  What causes people to react so strongly when the skill is
making money?<br><br>I think there are three reasons we treat making money as different:
the misleading model of wealth we learn as children; the disreputable
way in which, till recently, most fortunes were accumulated; and
the worry that great variations in income are somehow bad for
society.  As far as I can tell, the first is mistaken, the second
outdated, and the third empirically false.  Could it be that, in a
modern democracy, variation in income is actually a sign of health?<br><br><b>The Daddy Model of Wealth</b><br><br>When I was five I thought electricity was created by electric
sockets.  I didn't realize there were power plants out there
generating it.  Likewise, it doesn't occur to most kids that wealth
is something that has to be generated.  It seems to be something
that flows from parents.<br><br>Because of the circumstances in which they encounter it, children
tend to misunderstand wealth.  They confuse it with money.  They
think that there is a fixed amount of it.  And they think of it as
something that's distributed by authorities (and so should be
distributed equally), rather than something that has to be created
(and might be created unequally).<br><br>In fact, wealth is not money.  Money is just a convenient way of
trading one form of wealth for another.  Wealth is the underlying
stuff—the goods and services we buy.  When you travel to a
rich or poor country, you don't have to look at people's bank
accounts to tell which kind you're in.  You can <i>see</i>
wealth—in buildings and streets, in the clothes and the health
of the people.<br><br>Where does wealth come from?  People make it.  This was easier to
grasp when most people lived on farms, and made many of the things
they wanted with their own hands.  Then you could see in the house,
the herds, and the granary the wealth that each family created.  It
was obvious then too that the wealth of the world was not a fixed
quantity that had to be shared out, like slices of a pie.  If you
wanted more wealth, you could make it.<br><br>This is just as true today, though few of us create wealth directly
for ourselves (except for a few vestigial domestic tasks).  Mostly
we create wealth for other people in exchange for money, which we
then trade for the forms of wealth we want. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Because kids are unable to create wealth, whatever they have has
to be given to them.  And when wealth is something you're given,
then of course it seems that it should be distributed equally.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>
As in most families it is.  The kids see to that.  "Unfair," they
cry, when one sibling gets more than another.<br><br>In the real world, you can't keep living off your parents.  If you
want something, you either have to make it, or do something of
equivalent value for someone else, in order to get them to give you
enough money to buy it.  In the real world, wealth is (except for
a few specialists like thieves and speculators) something you have
to create, not something that's distributed by Daddy.  And since
the ability and desire to create it vary from person to person,
it's not made equally.<br><br>You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those
who make more money are often simply better at doing what people
want.  Top actors make a lot more money than B-list actors.  The
B-list actors might be almost as charismatic, but when people go
to the theater and look at the list of movies playing, they want
that extra oomph that the big stars have.<br><br>Doing what people want is not the only way to get money, of course.
You could also rob banks, or solicit bribes, or establish a monopoly.
Such tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed for
some of the biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the root
cause of variation in income.  The root cause of variation in income,
as Occam's Razor implies, is the same as the root cause of variation
in every other human skill.<br><br>In the United States, the CEO of a large public company makes about
100 times as much as the average person. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
Basketball players
make about 128 times as much, and baseball players 72 times as much.
Editorials quote this kind of statistic with horror.  But I have
no trouble imagining that one person could be 100 times as productive
as another.  In ancient Rome the price of <i>slaves</i> varied by
a factor of 50 depending on their skills. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
And that's without
considering motivation, or the extra leverage in productivity that
you can get from modern technology.<br><br>Editorials about athletes' or CEOs' salaries remind me of early
Christian writers, arguing from first principles about whether the
Earth was round, when they could just walk outside and check.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font>
How much someone's work is worth is not a policy question.  It's
something the market already determines.<br><br>"Are they really worth 100 of us?" editorialists ask.  Depends on
what you mean by worth.  If you mean worth in the sense of what
people will pay for their skills, the answer is yes, apparently.<br><br>A few CEOs' incomes reflect some kind of wrongdoing.  But are there
not others whose incomes really do reflect the wealth they generate?
Steve Jobs saved a company that was in a terminal decline.  And not
merely in the way a turnaround specialist does, by cutting costs;
he had to decide what Apple's next products should be.  Few others
could have done it.  And regardless of the case with CEOs, it's
hard to see how anyone could argue that the salaries of professional
basketball players don't reflect supply and demand.<br><br>It may seem unlikely in principle that one individual could really
generate so much more wealth than another.  The key to this mystery
is to revisit that question, are they really worth 100 of us?
<i>Would</i> a basketball team trade one of their players for 100
random people?  What would Apple's next product look like if you
replaced Steve Jobs with a committee of 100 random people? 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font>
These
things don't scale linearly.  Perhaps the CEO or the professional
athlete has only ten times (whatever that means) the skill and
determination of an ordinary person.  But it makes all the difference
that it's concentrated in one individual.<br><br>When we say that one kind of work is overpaid and another underpaid,
what are we really saying?  In a free market, prices are determined
by what buyers want.  People like baseball more than  poetry, so
baseball players make more than poets.  To say that a certain kind
of work is underpaid is thus identical with saying that people want
the wrong things.<br><br>Well, of course people want the wrong things.  It seems odd to be
surprised by that.  And it seems even odder to say that it's
<i>unjust</i> that certain kinds of work are underpaid. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font>
Then
you're saying that it's unjust that people want the wrong things.
It's  lamentable that people prefer reality TV and corndogs to
Shakespeare and steamed vegetables, but unjust?  That seems like
saying that blue is heavy, or that up is circular.<br><br>The appearance of the word "unjust" here is the unmistakable spectral
signature of the Daddy Model.  Why else would this idea occur in
this odd context?  Whereas if the speaker were still operating on
the Daddy Model, and saw wealth as something that flowed from a
common source and had to be shared out, rather than something
generated by doing what other people wanted, this is exactly what
you'd get on noticing that some people made much more than others.<br><br>When we talk about "unequal distribution of income," we should
also ask, where does that income come from?
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font>
Who made the wealth
it represents?  Because to the extent that income varies simply
according to how much wealth people create, the distribution may
be unequal, but it's hardly unjust.<br><br><b>Stealing It</b><br><br>The second reason we tend to find great disparities of wealth
alarming is that for most of human history the usual way to accumulate
a fortune was to steal it: in pastoral societies by cattle raiding;
in agricultural societies by appropriating others' estates in times
of war, and taxing them in times of peace.<br><br>In conflicts, those on the winning side would receive the estates
confiscated from the losers.  In England in the 1060s, when William
the Conqueror distributed the estates of the defeated Anglo-Saxon
nobles to his followers, the conflict was military.  By the 1530s,
when Henry VIII distributed the estates of the monasteries to his
followers, it was mostly political. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font>
But the principle was the
same.  Indeed, the same principle is at work now in Zimbabwe.<br><br>In more organized societies, like China, the ruler and his officials
used taxation instead of confiscation.  But here too we see the
same principle: the way to get rich was not to create wealth, but
to serve a ruler powerful enough to appropriate it.<br><br>This started to change in Europe with the rise of the middle class.
Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor
poor, but originally they were a distinct group.  In a feudal
society, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the
serfs who work their estates.  The middle class were a new, third
group who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing
and trade.<br><br>Starting in the tenth and eleventh centuries, petty nobles and
former serfs banded together in towns that gradually became powerful
enough to ignore the local feudal lords. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#777777">10</font></a>]</font>
Like serfs, the middle
class made a living largely by creating wealth.  (In port cities
like Genoa and Pisa, they also engaged in piracy.) But unlike serfs
they had an incentive to create a lot of it.  Any wealth a serf
created belonged to his master.  There was not much point in making
more than you could hide.  Whereas the independence of the townsmen
allowed them to keep whatever wealth they created.<br><br>Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as
a whole started to get richer very rapidly.  Nearly everything we
have was created by the middle class.  Indeed, the other two classes
have effectively disappeared in industrial societies, and their
names been given to either end of the middle class.  (In the original
sense of the word, Bill Gates is middle class.)<br><br>But it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation
definitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich.  In
England, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and in
fact only started to be called "corruption") when there started to
be other, faster ways to get rich.<br><br>Seventeenth-century England was much like the third world today,
in that government office was a recognized route to wealth.  The
great fortunes of that time still derived more from what we would
now call corruption than from commerce. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#777777">11</font></a>]</font>
By the nineteenth
century that had changed.  There continued to be bribes, as there
still are everywhere, but politics had by then been left to men who
were driven more by vanity than greed.  Technology had made it
possible to create wealth faster than you could steal it.  The
prototypical rich man of the nineteenth century was not a courtier
but an industrialist.<br><br>With the rise of the middle class, wealth stopped being a zero-sum
game.  Jobs and Wozniak didn't have to make us poor to make themselves
rich.  Quite the opposite: they created things that made our lives
materially richer.  They had to, or we wouldn't have paid for them.<br><br>But since for most of the world's history the main route to wealth
was to steal it, we tend to be suspicious of rich people.  Idealistic
undergraduates find their unconsciously preserved child's model of
wealth confirmed by eminent writers of the past.  It is a case of
the mistaken meeting the outdated.<br><br>"Behind every great fortune, there is a crime," Balzac wrote.  Except
he didn't.  What he actually said was that a great fortune with no
apparent cause was probably due to a crime well enough executed
that it had been forgotten.  If we were talking about Europe in
1000, or most of the third world today, the standard misquotation
would be spot on.  But Balzac lived in nineteenth-century France,
where the Industrial Revolution was well advanced.  He knew you
could make a fortune without stealing it.  After all, he did himself,
as a popular novelist.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#777777">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>Only a few countries (by no coincidence, the richest ones) have
reached this stage.  In most, corruption still has the upper hand.
In most, the fastest way to get wealth is by stealing it.  And so
when we see increasing differences in income in a rich country,
there is a tendency to worry that it's sliding back toward becoming
another Venezuela.  I think the opposite is happening. I think
you're seeing a country a full step ahead of Venezuela.<br><br><b>The Lever of Technology</b><br><br>Will technology increase the gap between rich and poor?  It will
certainly increase the gap between the productive and the unproductive.
That's the whole point of technology.   With a tractor an energetic
farmer could plow six times as much land in a day as he could with
a team of horses.  But only if he mastered a new kind of farming.<br><br>I've seen the lever of technology grow visibly in my own time.  In
high school I made money by mowing lawns and scooping ice cream at
Baskin-Robbins.  This was the only kind of work available at the
time.  Now high school kids could write software or design web
sites.  But only some of them will; the rest will still be scooping
ice cream.<br><br>I remember very vividly when in 1985 improved technology made it
possible for me to buy a computer of my own.  Within months I was
using it to make money as a freelance programmer.  A few years
before, I couldn't have done this.  A few years before, there was
no such <i>thing</i> as a freelance programmer.  But Apple created
wealth, in the form of powerful, inexpensive computers, and programmers
immediately set to work using it to create more.<br><br>As this example suggests, the rate at which technology increases
our productive capacity is probably exponential, rather than linear.
So we should expect to see ever-increasing variation in individual
productivity as time goes on.   Will that increase the gap between
rich and the poor?  Depends which gap you mean.<br><br>Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to
decrease other gaps.  A hundred years ago, the rich led a different
<i>kind</i> of life from ordinary people.  They lived in houses
full of servants, wore elaborately uncomfortable clothes, and
travelled about in carriages drawn by teams of horses which themselves
required their own houses and servants.  Now, thanks to technology,
the rich live more like the average person.<br><br>Cars are a good example of why.  It's possible to buy expensive,
handmade cars that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.  But there
is not much point.  Companies make more money by building a large
number of ordinary cars than a small number of expensive ones.  So
a company making a mass-produced car can afford to spend a lot more
on its design.  If you buy a custom-made car, something will always
be breaking.  The only point of buying one now is to advertise that
you can.<br><br>Or consider watches.  Fifty years ago, by spending a lot of money
on a watch you could get better performance.  When watches had
mechanical movements, expensive watches kept better time.  Not any
more.  Since the invention of the quartz movement, an ordinary Timex
is more accurate than a Patek Philippe costing hundreds of thousands
of dollars.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#777777">13</font></a>]</font>
Indeed, as with expensive cars, if you're determined
to spend a lot of money on a watch, you have to put up with some
inconvenience to do it: as well as keeping worse time, mechanical
watches have to be wound.<br><br>The only thing technology can't cheapen is brand.  Which is precisely
why we hear ever more about it.  Brand is the residue left as the
substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate.  But what
label you have on your stuff is a much smaller matter than having
it versus not having it.  In 1900, if you kept a carriage, no one
asked what year or brand it was.  If you had one, you were rich.
And if you weren't rich, you took the omnibus or walked.  Now even
the poorest Americans drive cars, and it is only because we're so
well trained by advertising that we can even recognize the especially
expensive ones.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#777777">14</font></a>]</font><br><br>The same pattern has played out in industry after industry.  If
there is enough demand for something, technology will make it cheap
enough to sell in large volumes, and the mass-produced versions
will be, if not better, at least more convenient.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#777777">15</font></a>]</font>
And there
is nothing the rich like more than convenience.  The rich people I
know drive the same cars, wear the same clothes, have the same kind
of furniture, and eat the same foods as my other friends.  Their
houses are in different neighborhoods, or if in the same neighborhood
are different sizes, but within them life is similar.  The houses
are made using the same construction techniques and contain much
the same objects.  It's inconvenient to do something expensive and
custom.<br><br>The rich spend their time more like everyone else too.  Bertie
Wooster seems long gone.  Now, most people who are rich enough not
to work do anyway.  It's not just social pressure that makes them;
idleness is lonely and demoralizing.<br><br>Nor do we have the social distinctions there were a hundred years
ago.   The novels and etiquette manuals of that period read now
like descriptions of some strange tribal society.  "With respect
to the continuance of friendships..." hints <i>Mrs. Beeton's Book
of Household Management</i> (1880), "it may be found necessary, in
some cases, for a mistress to relinquish, on assuming the responsibility
of a household, many of those commenced in the earlier part of her
life." A woman who married a rich man was expected to drop friends
who didn't.  You'd seem a barbarian if you behaved that way today.
You'd also have a very boring life.  People still tend to segregate
themselves somewhat, but much more on the basis of education than
wealth.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#777777">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>Materially and socially, technology seems to be decreasing the gap
between the rich and the poor, not increasing it.  If Lenin walked
around the offices of a company like Yahoo or Intel or Cisco, he'd
think communism had won.  Everyone would be wearing the same clothes,
have the same kind of office (or rather, cubicle) with the same
furnishings, and address one another by their first names instead
of by honorifics.  Everything would seem exactly as he'd predicted,
until he looked at their bank accounts.  Oops.<br><br>Is it a problem if technology increases that gap?  It doesn't seem
to be so far.  As it increases the gap in income, it seems to
decrease most other gaps.<br><br><b>Alternative to an Axiom</b><br><br>One often hears a policy criticized on the grounds that it would
increase the income gap between rich and poor.  As if it were an
axiom that this would be bad.  It might be true that increased
variation in income would be bad, but I don't see how we can say
it's <i>axiomatic.</i><br><br>Indeed, it may even be false, in industrial democracies.  In a
society of serfs and warlords, certainly, variation in income is a
sign of an underlying problem.  But serfdom is not the only cause
of variation in income.  A 747 pilot doesn't make 40 times as much
as a checkout clerk because he is a warlord who somehow holds her
in thrall.  His skills are simply much more valuable.<br><br>I'd like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society,
increasing variation in income is a sign of health.  Technology
seems to increase the variation in productivity at faster than
linear rates.  If we don't see corresponding variation in income,
there are three possible explanations: (a) that technical innovation
has stopped, (b) that the people who would create the most wealth
aren't doing it, or (c) that they aren't getting paid for it.<br><br>I think we can safely say that (a) and (b) would be bad.  If you
disagree, try living for a year using only the resources available
to the average Frankish nobleman in 800, and report back to us.
(I'll be generous and not send you back to the stone age.)<br><br>The only option, if you're going to have an increasingly prosperous
society without increasing variation in income, seems to be (c),
that people will create a lot of wealth without being paid for it.
That Jobs and Wozniak, for example, will cheerfully work 20-hour
days to produce the Apple computer for a society that allows them,
after taxes, to keep just enough of their income to match what they
would have made working 9 to 5 at a big company.<br><br>Will people create wealth if they can't get paid for it?  Only if
it's fun.  People will write operating systems for free.  But they
won't install them, or take support calls, or train customers to
use them.  And at least 90% of the work that even the highest tech
companies do is of this second, unedifying kind.<br><br>All the unfun kinds of wealth creation slow dramatically in a society
that confiscates private fortunes.  We can confirm this empirically.
Suppose you hear a strange noise that you think may be due to a
nearby fan.  You turn the fan off, and the noise stops.  You turn
the fan back on, and the noise starts again.  Off, quiet.  On,
noise.  In the absence of other information, it would seem the noise
is caused by the fan.<br><br>At various times and places in history, whether you could accumulate
a fortune by creating wealth has been turned on and off.  Northern
Italy in 800, off (warlords would steal it).  Northern Italy in
1100, on.  Central France in 1100, off (still feudal).  England in
1800, on.  England in 1974, off (98% tax on investment income).
United States in 1974, on.  We've even had a twin study: West
Germany, on;  East Germany, off.  In every case, the creation of
wealth seems to appear and disappear like the noise of a fan as you
switch on and off the prospect of keeping it.<br><br>There is some momentum involved.  It probably takes at least a
generation to turn people into East Germans (luckily for England).
But if it were merely a fan we were studying, without all the extra
baggage that comes from the controversial topic of wealth, no one
would have any doubt that the fan was causing the noise.<br><br>If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private
fortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as
some modern governments have done, the result always seems to be
the same.    Society as a whole ends up poorer.<br><br>If I had a choice of living in a society where I was materially
much better off than I am now, but was among the poorest, or in one
where I was the richest, but much worse off than I am now, I'd take
the first option.  If I had children, it would arguably be immoral
not to.  It's absolute poverty you want to avoid, not relative
poverty.  If, as the evidence so far implies, you have to have one
or the other in your society, take relative poverty.<br><br>You need rich people in your society not so much because in spending
their money they create jobs, but because of what they have to do
to <i>get</i> rich.  I'm not talking about the trickle-down effect
here.  I'm not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich, he'll
hire you as a waiter at his next party.  I'm saying that he'll make
you a tractor to replace your horse.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Part of the reason this subject is so contentious is that some
of those most vocal on the subject of wealth—university
students, heirs, professors, politicians, and journalists—have
the least experience creating it.  (This phenomenon will be familiar
to anyone who has overheard conversations about sports in a bar.)<br><br>Students are mostly still on the parental dole, and have not stopped
to think about where that money comes from.  Heirs will be on the
parental dole for life.  Professors and politicians live within
socialist eddies of the economy, at one remove from the creation
of wealth, and are paid a flat rate regardless of how hard they
work.  And journalists as part of their professional code segregate
themselves from the revenue-collecting half of the businesses they
work for (the ad sales department).  Many of these people never
come face to face with the fact that the money they receive represents
wealth—wealth that, except in the case of journalists, someone
else created earlier.  They live in a world in which income <i>is</i>
doled out by a central authority according to some abstract notion
of fairness (or randomly, in the case of heirs), rather than given
by other people in return for something they wanted, so it may seem
to them unfair that things don't work the same in the rest of the
economy.<br><br>(Some professors do create a great deal of wealth for
society.  But the money they're paid isn't a <i>quid pro quo</i>.
It's more in the nature of an investment.)<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]

According to a study by the Corporate Library, the median total
compensation, including salary, bonus, stock grants, and the exercise
of stock options, of S&amp;P 500 CEOs in 2002 was $3.65 million.
According to <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, the average NBA player's
salary during the 2002-03 season was $4.54 million, and the average
major league baseball player's salary at the start of the 2003
season was $2.56 million.  According to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, the mean annual wage in the US in 2002 was $35,560.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
In the early empire the price of an ordinary adult slave seems
to have been about 2,000 sestertii (e.g. Horace, <i>Sat.</i> ii.7.43).
A servant girl cost 600 (Martial vi.66), while Columella (iii.3.8)
says that a skilled vine-dresser was worth 8,000.  A doctor, P.
Decimus Eros Merula, paid 50,000 sestertii for his freedom (Dessau,
<i>Inscriptiones</i> 7812).  Seneca (<i>Ep.</i> xxvii.7) reports
that one Calvisius Sabinus paid 100,000 sestertii apiece for slaves
learned in the Greek classics.  Pliny (<i>Hist. Nat.</i> vii.39)
says that the highest price paid for a slave up to his time was
700,000 sestertii, for the linguist (and presumably teacher) Daphnis,
but that this had since been exceeded by actors buying their own
freedom.<br><br>Classical Athens saw a similar variation in prices.  An ordinary
laborer was worth about 125 to 150 drachmae.  Xenophon (<i>Mem.</i>
ii.5) mentions prices ranging from 50 to 6,000 drachmae (for the
manager of a silver mine).<br><br>For more on the economics of ancient slavery see:<br><br>Jones, A. H. M., "Slavery in the Ancient World," <i>Economic History
Review</i>, 2:9 (1956), 185-199, reprinted in Finley, M. I. (ed.),

One of the biggest divergences between the Daddy Model and
reality is the valuation of hard work.  In the Daddy Model, hard
work is in itself deserving.  In reality, wealth is measured by
what one delivers, not how much effort it costs.  If I paint someone's
house, the owner shouldn't pay me extra for doing it with a toothbrush.<br><br>It will seem to someone still implicitly operating on the Daddy
Model that it is unfair when someone works hard and doesn't get
paid much.  To help clarify the matter, get rid of everyone else
and put our worker on a desert island, hunting and gathering fruit.
If he's bad at it he'll work very hard and not end up with much
food.  Is this unfair?  Who is being unfair to him?<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Part of the reason for the tenacity of the Daddy Model may be
the dual meaning of "distribution." When economists talk about
"distribution of income," they mean statistical distribution.  But
when you use the phrase frequently, you can't help associating it
with the other sense of the word (as in e.g. "distribution of alms"),
and thereby subconsciously seeing wealth as something that flows
from some central tap.  The word "regressive" as applied to tax
rates has a similar effect, at least on me; how can anything
<i>regressive</i> be good?<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
"From the beginning of the reign Thomas Lord Roos was an assiduous
courtier of the young Henry VIII and was soon to reap the rewards.
In 1525 he was made a Knight of the Garter and given the Earldom
of Rutland.  In the thirties his support of the breach with Rome,
his zeal in crushing the Pilgrimage of Grace, and his readiness to
vote the death-penalty in the succession of spectacular treason
trials that punctuated Henry's erratic matrimonial progress made
him an obvious candidate for grants of monastic property."<br><br>Stone, Lawrence, <i>Family and Fortune: Studies in Aristocratic

William Cecil and his son Robert were each in turn the most
powerful minister of the crown, and both used their position to
amass fortunes among the largest of their times.  Robert in particular
took bribery to the point of treason.  "As Secretary of State and
the leading advisor to King James on foreign policy, [he] was a
special recipient of favour, being offered large bribes by the Dutch
not to make peace with Spain, and large bribes by Spain to make
peace." (Stone, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 17.)<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]

To say anything meaningful about income trends, you have to
talk about real income, or income as measured in what it can buy.
But the usual way of calculating real income ignores much of the
growth in wealth over time, because it depends on a consumer price
index created by bolting end to end a series of numbers that are
only locally accurate, and that don't include the prices of new
inventions until they become so common that their prices stabilize.<br><br>So while we might think it was very much better to live in a world
with antibiotics or air travel or an electric power grid than
without, real income statistics calculated in the usual way will
prove to us that we are only slightly richer for having these things.<br><br>Another approach would be to ask, if you were going back to the
year x in a time machine, how much would you have to spend on trade
goods to make your fortune?  For example, if you were going back
to 1970 it would certainly be less than $500, because the processing
power you can get for $500 today would have been worth at least
$150 million in 1970.  The function goes asymptotic fairly quickly,
because for times over a hundred years or so you could get all you
needed in present-day trash.  In 1800 an empty plastic drink bottle
with a screw top would have seemed a miracle of workmanship.<br><br>[<a name="f16n"><font color="#000000">16</font></a>]
Some will say this amounts to the same thing, because the rich
have better opportunities for education.  That's a valid point.  It
is still possible, to a degree, to buy your kids' way into top
colleges by sending them to private schools that in effect hack the
college admissions process.<br><br>According to a 2002 report by the National Center for Education
Statistics, about 1.7% of American kids attend private, non-sectarian
schools.  At Princeton, 36% of the class of 2007 came from such
schools.  (Interestingly, the number at Harvard is significantly
lower, about 28%.)  Obviously this is a huge loophole.  It does at
least seem to be closing, not widening.<br><br>Perhaps the designers of admissions processes should take a lesson
from the example of computer security, and instead of just assuming
that their system can't be hacked, measure the degree to which it
is.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.liberalismo.org/articulo/392/">Spanish Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

July 2004<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at Oscon 2004.)</i><br><br><!-- Some programmers are much better than others.  This variation
is one of the most distinctive things about our field.  But I think
it's something more and more fields will see in time.  So if we
can understand this phenomenon, we may be learning about
more than programming.  We may be learning the pattern
for the future.<br /><br /><b>Edisons</b>
-->
A few months ago I finished a new 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596006624">book</a>, 
and in reviews I keep
noticing words like "provocative'' and "controversial.'' To say
nothing of "idiotic.''<br><br>I didn't mean to make the book controversial.  I was trying to make
it efficient.  I didn't want to waste people's time telling them
things they already knew.  It's more efficient just to give them
the diffs.  But I suppose that's bound to yield an alarming book.<br><br><b>Edisons</b><br><br>There's no controversy about which idea is most controversial:
the suggestion that variation in wealth might not be as big a
problem as we think.<br><br>I didn't say in the book that variation in wealth was in itself a
good thing.  I said in some situations it might be a sign of good
things.  A throbbing headache is not a good thing, but it can be
a sign of a good thing-- for example, that you're recovering
consciousness after being hit on the head.<br><br>Variation in wealth can be a sign of variation in productivity.
(In a society of one, they're identical.) And <i>that</i>
is almost certainly a good thing: if your society has no variation
in productivity, it's probably not because everyone is Thomas
Edison.  It's probably because you have no Thomas Edisons.<br><br>In a low-tech society you don't see much variation in productivity.
If you have a tribe of nomads collecting sticks for a fire, how
much more productive is the best stick gatherer going to be than
the worst?  A factor of two?  Whereas when you hand people a complex tool
like a computer, the variation in what they can do with
it is enormous.<br><br>That's not a new idea.  Fred Brooks wrote about it in 1974, and
the study he quoted was published in 1968.  But I think he
underestimated the variation between programmers.  He wrote about productivity in lines
of code:  the best programmers can solve a given problem in a tenth
the time.  But what if the problem isn't given? In programming, as
in many fields, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding
what problems to solve.  Imagination is hard to measure, but
in practice it dominates the kind of productivity that's measured
in lines of code.<br><br>Productivity varies in any field, but there are few in which it
varies so much.  The variation between programmers
is so great that it becomes a difference in kind.  I don't
think this is something intrinsic to programming, though.  In every field,
technology magnifies differences in productivity.  I think what's
happening in programming is just that we have a lot of technological
leverage.  But in every field the lever is getting longer, so the
variation we see is something that more and more fields will see
as time goes on.  And the success of companies, and countries, will
depend increasingly on how they deal with it.<br><br>If variation in productivity increases with technology, then the
contribution of the most productive individuals will not only be
disproportionately large, but will actually grow with time.  When
you reach the point where 90% of a group's output is created by 1%
of its members, you lose big if something (whether Viking raids,
or central planning) drags their productivity down to the average.<br><br>If we want to get the most out of them, we need to understand these
especially productive people.  What motivates them?  What do they
need to do their jobs?  How do you recognize them? How do you
get them to come and work for you?  And then of course there's the
question, how do you become one?<br><br><b>More than Money</b><br><br>I know a handful of super-hackers, so I sat down and thought about
what they have in common.  Their defining quality is probably that
they really love to program.  Ordinary programmers write code to pay
the bills.  Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun,
and which they're delighted to find people will pay them for.<br><br>Great programmers are sometimes said to be indifferent to money.
This isn't quite true.  It is true that all they really care about
is doing interesting work.  But if you make enough money, you get
to work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackers <i>are</i>
attracted by the idea of making really large amounts of money.
But as long as they still have to show up for work every day, they
care more about what they do there than how much they get paid for
it.<br><br>Economically, this is a fact of the greatest importance, because
it means you don't have to pay great hackers anything like what
they're worth.  A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times
as productive as an ordinary one, but he'll consider himself lucky
to get paid three times as much.  As I'll explain later, this is
partly because great hackers don't know how good they are.  But
it's also because money is not the main thing they want.<br><br>What do hackers want?  Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools.
In fact, that's an understatement.  Good hackers find it unbearable
to use bad tools.  They'll simply refuse to work on projects with
the wrong infrastructure.<br><br>At a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on our
bulletin board was an ad from IBM.  It was a picture of an AS400,
and the headline read, I think, "hackers despise
it.'' [1]<br><br>When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you're
not just making a technical decision.  You're also making a social
decision, and this may be the more important of the two.  For
example, if your company wants to write some software, it might
seem a prudent choice to write it in Java.  But when you choose a
language, you're also choosing a community.  The programmers you'll
be able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as
<a href="pypar.html">smart</a> as the
ones you could get to work on a project written in Python.
And the quality of your hackers probably matters more than the
language you choose.  Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers
prefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relative
merits of those languages.<br><br>Business types prefer the most popular languages because they view
languages as standards. They don't want to bet the company on
Betamax.  The thing about languages, though, is that they're not
just standards.  If you have to move bits over a network, by all
means use TCP/IP.  But a programming language isn't just a format.
A programming language is a medium of expression.<br><br>I've read that Java has just overtaken Cobol as the most popular
language.  As a standard, you couldn't wish for more.  But as a
medium of expression, you could do a lot better.  Of all the great
programmers I can think of, I know of only one who would voluntarily
program in Java.  And of all the great programmers I can think of
who don't work for Sun, on Java, I know of zero.<br><br>Great hackers also generally insist on using open source software.
Not just because it's better, but because it gives them more control.
Good hackers insist on control.  This is part of what makes them
good hackers:  when something's broken, they need to fix it.  You
want them to feel this way about the software they're writing for
you.  You shouldn't be surprised when they feel the same way about
the operating system.<br><br>A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new
startup he was involved with.  It sounded promising.  But the next
time I talked to him, he said they'd decided to build their software
on Windows NT, and had just hired a very experienced NT developer
to be their chief technical officer.  When I heard this, I thought,
these guys are doomed.  One, the CTO couldn't be a first rate
hacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would have
had to use NT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn't imagine
a great hacker doing that; and two, even if he was good, he'd have
a hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project had
to be built on NT. [2]<br><br><b>The Final Frontier</b><br><br>After software, the most important tool to a hacker is probably
his office.  Big companies think the function of office space is to express
rank.  But hackers use their offices for more than that: they
use their office as a place to think in.  And if you're a technology
company, their thoughts are your product.  So making hackers work
in a noisy, distracting environment is like having a paint factory
where the air is full of soot.<br><br>The cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles, and with
good reason.  All the hackers I know despise them.  The mere prospect
of being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from working on
hard problems.  If you want to get real work done in an office with
cubicles, you have two options: work at home, or come in early or
late or on a weekend, when no one else is there.  Don't companies
realize this is a sign that something is broken?  An office
environment is supposed to be something that <i>helps</i>
you work, not something you work despite.<br><br>Companies like Cisco are proud that everyone there has a cubicle,
even the CEO.  But they're not so advanced as they think; obviously
they still view office space as a badge of rank.  Note too that
Cisco is famous for doing very little product development in house.
They get new technology by buying the startups that created it-- where
presumably the hackers did have somewhere quiet to work.<br><br>One big company that understands what hackers need is Microsoft.
I once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of a
door.  Work for us, the premise was, and we'll give you a place to
work where you can actually get work done.   And you know, Microsoft
is remarkable among big companies in that they are able to develop
software in house.  Not well, perhaps, but well enough.<br><br>If companies want hackers to be productive, they should look at
what they do at home.  At home, hackers can arrange things themselves
so they can get the most done.  And when they work at home, hackers
don't work in noisy, open spaces; they work in rooms with doors.  They
work in cosy, neighborhoody places with people around and somewhere
to walk when they need to mull something over, instead of in glass
boxes set in acres of parking lots.  They have a sofa they can take
a nap on when they feel tired, instead of sitting in a coma at
their desk, pretending to work.  There's no crew of people with
vacuum cleaners that roars through every evening during the prime
hacking hours.  There are no meetings or, God forbid, corporate
retreats or team-building exercises.  And when you look at what
they're doing on that computer, you'll find it reinforces what I
said earlier about tools.  They may have to use Java and Windows
at work, but at home, where they can choose for themselves, you're
more likely to find them using Perl and Linux.<br><br>Indeed, these statistics about Cobol or Java being the most popular
language can be misleading.  What we ought to look at, if we want
to know what tools are best, is what hackers choose when they can
choose freely-- that is, in projects of their own.  When you ask
that question, you find that open source operating systems already
have a dominant market share, and the number one language is probably
Perl.<br><br><b>Interesting</b><br><br>Along with good tools, hackers want interesting projects.  What
makes a project interesting?  Well, obviously overtly sexy
applications like stealth planes or special effects software would
be interesting to work on.  But any application can be interesting
if it poses novel technical challenges.  So it's hard to predict
which problems hackers will like, because some become
interesting only when the people working on them discover a new
kind of solution.  Before ITA
(who wrote the software inside Orbitz),
the people working on airline fare searches probably thought it
was one of the most boring applications imaginable.  But ITA made
it interesting by 
<a href="carl.html">redefining</a> the problem in a more ambitious way.<br><br>I think the same thing happened at Google.  When Google was founded,
the conventional wisdom among the so-called portals was that search
was boring and unimportant.  But the guys at Google didn't think
search was boring, and that's why they do it so well.<br><br>This is an area where managers can make a difference.  Like a parent
saying to a child, I bet you can't clean up your whole room in
ten minutes, a good manager can sometimes redefine a problem as a
more interesting one.  Steve Jobs seems to be particularly good at
this, in part simply by having high standards.  There were a lot
of small, inexpensive computers before the Mac.  He redefined the
problem as: make one that's beautiful.  And that probably drove
the developers harder than any carrot or stick could.<br><br>They certainly delivered.  When the Mac first appeared, you didn't
even have to turn it on to know it would be good; you could tell
from the case.  A few weeks ago I was walking along the street in
Cambridge, and in someone's trash I saw what appeared to be a Mac
carrying case.  I looked inside, and there was a Mac SE.  I carried
it home and plugged it in, and it booted.  The happy Macintosh
face, and then the finder.  My God, it was so simple.  It was just
like ... Google.<br><br>Hackers like to work for people with high standards.  But it's not
enough just to be exacting.  You have to insist on the right things.
Which usually means that you have to be a hacker yourself.  I've
seen occasional articles about how to manage programmers.  Really
there should be two articles: one about what to do if
you are yourself a programmer, and one about what to do if you're not.  And the 
second could probably be condensed into two words:  give up.<br><br>The problem is not so much the day to day management.  Really good
hackers are practically self-managing.  The problem is, if you're
not a hacker, you can't tell who the good hackers are.  A similar
problem explains why American cars are so ugly.  I call it the
<i>design paradox.</i>  You might think that you could make your products
beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them.  But if
you yourself don't have good <a href="taste.html">taste</a>, 
how are you going to recognize
a good designer?  By definition you can't tell from his portfolio.
And you can't go by the awards he's won or the jobs he's had,
because in design, as in most fields, those tend to be driven by
fashion and schmoozing, with actual ability a distant third.
There's no way around it:  you can't manage a process intended to
produce beautiful things without knowing what beautiful is.  American
cars are ugly because American car companies are run by people with
bad taste.<br><br>Many people in this country think of taste as something elusive,
or even frivolous.  It is neither.  To drive design, a manager must
be the most demanding user of a company's products.  And if you
have really good taste, you can, as Steve Jobs does, make satisfying
you the kind of problem that good people like to work on.<br><br><b>Nasty Little Problems</b><br><br>It's pretty easy to say what kinds of problems are not interesting:
those where instead of solving a few big, clear, problems, you have
to solve a lot of nasty little ones.  One of the worst kinds of
projects is writing an interface to a piece of software that's
full of bugs.  Another is when you have to customize
something for an individual client's complex and ill-defined needs.
To hackers these kinds of projects are the death of a thousand
cuts.<br><br>The distinguishing feature of nasty little problems is that you
don't learn anything from them.   Writing a compiler is interesting
because it teaches you what a compiler is.  But writing an interface
to a buggy piece of software doesn't teach you anything, because the
bugs are random.  [3] So it's not just fastidiousness that makes good
hackers avoid nasty little problems.  It's more a question of
self-preservation.  Working on nasty little problems makes you
stupid.  Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid
cheeseburgers.<br><br>Of course some problems inherently have this character.  And because
of supply and demand, they pay especially well.  So a company that
found a way to get great hackers to work on tedious problems would
be very successful.  How would you do it?<br><br>One place this happens is in startups.  At our startup we had 
Robert Morris working as a system administrator.  That's like having the
Rolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah.  You can't hire that kind of
talent.  But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies
of which they're the founders.  [4]<br><br>Bigger companies solve the problem by partitioning the company.
They get smart people to work for them by establishing a separate
R&amp;D department where employees don't have to work directly on
customers' nasty little problems. [5] In this model, the research
department functions like a mine. They produce new ideas; maybe
the rest of the company will be able to use them.<br><br>You may not have to go to this extreme.  
<a href="progbot.html">Bottom-up programming</a>
suggests another way to partition the company: have the smart people
work as toolmakers.  If your company makes software to do x, have
one group that builds tools for writing software of that type, and
another that uses these tools to write the applications.  This way
you might be able to get smart people to write 99% of your code,
but still keep them almost as insulated from users as they would
be in a traditional research department.  The toolmakers would have
users, but they'd only be the company's own developers.  [6]<br><br>If Microsoft used this approach, their software wouldn't be so full
of security holes, because the less smart people writing the actual
applications wouldn't be doing low-level stuff like allocating
memory.  Instead of writing Word directly in C, they'd be plugging
together big Lego blocks of Word-language.  (Duplo, I believe, is
the technical term.)<br><br><b>Clumping</b><br><br>Along with interesting problems, what good hackers like is other
good hackers.  Great hackers tend to clump together-- sometimes
spectacularly so, as at Xerox Parc.   So you won't attract good
hackers in linear proportion to how good an environment you create
for them.  The tendency to clump means it's more like the square
of the environment.  So it's winner take all.  At any given time,
there are only about ten or twenty places where hackers most want to
work, and if you aren't one of them, you won't just have fewer
great hackers, you'll have zero.<br><br>Having great hackers is not, by itself, enough to make a company
successful.  It works well for Google and ITA, which are two of
the hot spots right now, but it didn't help Thinking Machines or
Xerox.  Sun had a good run for a while, but their business model
is a down elevator.  In that situation, even the best hackers can't
save you.<br><br>I think, though, that all other things being equal, a company that
can attract great hackers will have a huge advantage.  There are
people who would disagree with this.  When we were making the rounds
of venture capital firms in the 1990s, several told us that software
companies didn't win by writing great software, but through brand,
and dominating channels, and doing the right deals.<br><br>They really seemed to believe this, and I think I know why.  I
think what a lot of VCs are looking for, at least unconsciously,
is the next Microsoft.  And of course if Microsoft is your model,
you shouldn't be looking for companies that hope to win by writing
great software.  But VCs are mistaken to look for the next Microsoft,
because no startup can be the next Microsoft unless some other
company is prepared to bend over at just the right moment and be
the next IBM.<br><br>It's a mistake to use Microsoft as a model, because their whole
culture derives from that one lucky break.  Microsoft is a bad data
point.  If you throw them out, you find that good products do tend
to win in the market.  What VCs should be looking for is the next
Apple, or the next Google.<br><br>I think Bill Gates knows this.  What worries him about Google is
not the power of their brand, but the fact that they have
better hackers. [7]<br><br>
<b>Recognition</b><br><br>So who are the great hackers?  How do you know when you meet one?
That turns out to be very hard.  Even hackers can't tell.  I'm
pretty sure now that my friend Trevor Blackwell is a great hacker.
You may have read on Slashdot how he made his 
<a href="http://www.tlb.org/scooter.html">own Segway</a>.  The
remarkable thing about this project was that he wrote all the
software in one day (in Python, incidentally).<br><br>For Trevor, that's
par for the course.  But when I first met him, I thought he was a
complete idiot.  He was standing in Robert Morris's office babbling
at him about something or other, and I remember standing behind
him making frantic gestures at Robert to shoo this nut out of his
office so we could go to lunch.  Robert says he misjudged Trevor
at first too.  Apparently when Robert first met him, Trevor had
just begun a new scheme that involved writing down everything about
every aspect of his life on a stack of index cards, which he carried
with him everywhere.  He'd also just arrived from Canada, and had
a strong Canadian accent and a mullet.<br><br>The problem is compounded by the fact that hackers, despite their
reputation for social obliviousness, sometimes put a good deal of
effort into seeming smart.  When I was in grad school I used to
hang around the MIT AI Lab occasionally. It was kind of intimidating
at first.  Everyone there spoke so fast.  But after a while I
learned the trick of speaking fast.  You don't have to think any
faster; just use twice as many words to say everything.  <!-- At the
time I used to consult on the side, and when I was talking to
clients I would sometimes put on this MIT manner deliberately to
overawe them, especially during demos of software I'd supposedly
been working on for weeks but had in fact written the night before. --><br><br>With this amount of noise in the signal, it's hard to tell good
hackers when you meet them.  I can't tell, even now.  You also
can't tell from their resumes.  It seems like the only way to judge
a hacker is to work with him on something.<br><br>And this is the reason that high-tech areas 
only happen around universities.  The active ingredient
here is not so much the professors as the students.  Startups grow up
around universities because universities bring together promising young
people and make them work on the same projects.  The
smart ones learn who the other smart ones are, and together
they cook up new projects of their own.<br><br>Because you can't tell a great hacker except by working with him,
hackers themselves can't tell how good they are.  This is true to
a degree in most fields.  I've found that people who
are great at something are not so much convinced of their own
greatness as mystified at why everyone else seems so incompetent.
<!-- The people I've met who do great work rarely think that they're
doing great work.  They generally feel that they're stupid and
lazy, that their brain only works properly one day out of ten, and
that it's only a matter of time until they're found out. --><br><br>But it's particularly hard for hackers to know how good they are,
because it's hard to compare their work.  This is easier in most
other fields.  In the hundred meters, you know in 10 seconds who's
fastest.  Even in math there seems to be a general consensus about
which problems are hard to solve, and what constitutes a good
solution.  But hacking is like writing.  Who can say which of two
novels is better?  Certainly not the authors.<br><br>With hackers, at least, other hackers can tell.  That's because,
unlike novelists, hackers collaborate on projects.  When you get
to hit a few difficult problems over the net at someone, you learn
pretty quickly how hard they hit them back.  But hackers can't
watch themselves at work.  So if you ask a great hacker how good
he is, he's almost certain to reply, I don't know.  He's not just
being modest.  He really doesn't know.<br><br>And none of us know, except about people we've actually worked
with.  Which puts us in a weird situation: we don't know who our
heroes should be.  The hackers who become famous tend to become
famous by random accidents of PR.  Occasionally I need to give an
example of a great hacker, and I never know who to use.  The first
names that come to mind always tend to be people I know personally,
but it seems lame to use them.  So, I think, maybe I should say
Richard Stallman, or Linus Torvalds, or Alan Kay, or someone famous
like that.  But I have no idea if these guys are great hackers.
I've never worked with them on anything.<br><br>If there is a Michael Jordan of hacking, no one knows, including
him.<br><br><b>Cultivation</b><br><br>Finally, the question the hackers have all been wondering about:
how do you become a great hacker?  I don't know if it's possible
to make yourself into one.  But it's certainly possible to do things
that make you stupid, and if you can make yourself stupid, you
can probably make yourself smart too.<br><br>The key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like.
When I think about the great hackers I know, one thing they have
in common is the extreme 
<a href="procrastination.html">difficulty</a> of making them work 
on anything they
don't want to.  I don't know if this is cause or effect; it may be
both.<br><br>To do something well you have to <a href="love.html">love</a> it.  
So to the extent you
can preserve hacking as something you love, you're likely to do it
well.  Try to keep the sense of wonder you had about programming at
age 14.  If you're worried that your current job is rotting your
brain, it probably is.<br><br>The best hackers tend to be smart, of course, but that's true in
a lot of fields.  Is there some quality that's unique to hackers?
I asked some friends, and the number one thing they mentioned was
curiosity.  
I'd always supposed that all smart people were curious--
that curiosity was simply the first derivative of knowledge.  But
apparently hackers are particularly curious, especially about how
things work.  That makes sense, because programs are in effect
giant descriptions of how things work.<br><br>Several friends mentioned hackers' ability to concentrate-- their
ability, as one put it, to "tune out everything outside their own
heads.''  I've certainly noticed this.  And I've heard several 
hackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can't program at
all.   So maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus.
Perhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into their
head, so that when they look at a line of code, they see not just
that line but the whole program around it.  John McPhee
wrote that Bill Bradley's success as a basketball player was due
partly to his extraordinary peripheral vision.  "Perfect'' eyesight
means about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision.  Bill Bradley
had 70; he could see the basket when he was looking at the floor.
Maybe great hackers have some similar inborn ability.  (I cheat by
using a very <a href="power.html">dense</a> language, 
which shrinks the court.)<br><br>This could explain the disconnect over cubicles.  Maybe the people
in charge of facilities, not having any concentration to shatter,
have no idea that working in a cubicle feels to a hacker like having
one's brain in a blender.  (Whereas Bill, if the rumors of autism
are true, knows all too well.)<br><br>One difference I've noticed between great hackers and smart people
in general is that hackers are more 
<a href="say.html">politically incorrect</a>.  To the
extent there is a secret handshake among good hackers, it's when they
know one another well enough to express opinions that would get
them stoned to death by the general public.  And I can see why
political incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming.
Programs are very complex and, at least in the hands of good
programmers, very fluid.  In such situations it's helpful to have
a habit of questioning assumptions.<br><br>Can you cultivate these qualities?  I don't know.  But you can at
least not repress them.  So here is my best shot at a recipe.  If
it is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do
it may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have
to work on boring projects (unless your family will starve otherwise),
and in return, you'll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job.
All the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal, though
perhaps none of them had any choice in the matter.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br><!--[h] The most productive individuals at different stages of technology
are not necessarily the same people.  Energy and determination are
always important, but physical strength, for example, decreases in
importance as technology increases.<br /><br />In early modern Europe, the most important quality may have been
organization.  The kind of brilliance that distinguished Isaac
Newton had little practical effect.  It would have more now.-->
[1] In fairness, I have to say that IBM makes decent hardware.  I
wrote this on an IBM laptop.<br><br>[2] They did turn out to be doomed.  They shut down a few months
later.<br><br>[3] I think this is what people mean when they talk
about the "meaning of life."  On the face of it, this seems an 
odd idea.  Life isn't an expression; how could it have meaning?
But it can have a quality that feels a lot like meaning.  In a project
like a compiler, you have to solve a lot of problems, but the problems
all fall into a pattern, as in a signal.  Whereas when the problems
you have to solve are random, they seem like noise.
<!-- What's the meaning of life?  A metaphor.--><br><br>[4] Einstein at one point worked designing refrigerators. (He had equity.)<br><br>[5] It's hard to say exactly what constitutes research in the
computer world, but as a first approximation, it's software that
doesn't have users.<br><br>I don't think it's publication that makes the best hackers want to work
in research departments.  I think it's mainly not having to have a
three hour meeting with a product manager about problems integrating
the Korean version of Word 13.27 with the talking paperclip.<br><br>[6] Something similar has been happening for a long time in the
construction industry. When you had a house built a couple hundred
years ago, the local builders built everything in it.  But increasingly
what builders do is assemble components designed and manufactured
by someone else.  This has, like the arrival of desktop publishing,
given people the freedom to experiment in disastrous ways, but it
is certainly more efficient.<br><br>[7] Google is much more dangerous to Microsoft than Netscape was.
Probably more dangerous than any other company has ever been.  Not
least because they're determined to fight.  On their job listing
page, they say that one of their "core values'' is "Don't be evil.''
From a company selling soybean oil or mining equipment, such a
statement would merely be eccentric.  But I think all of us in the
computer world recognize who that is a declaration of war on.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Sarah Harlin

people: that you could get smarter programmers to work on
a Python project than you could to work on a Java project.<br><br>I didn't mean by this that Java programmers are dumb.  I
meant that Python programmers are smart. It's a lot of
work to learn a new programming language.  And people don't
learn Python because it will get them a job; they learn it
because they genuinely like to program and aren't satisfied with the languages they
already know.<br><br>Which makes them exactly the kind of programmers
companies should want to hire.  Hence what, for lack of a better
name, I'll call the Python paradox: if a company chooses to write
its software in a comparatively esoteric language, they'll be able 
to hire better programmers, because they'll attract only those
who cared enough to learn it.  And for 
programmers the paradox is even more pronounced: the language
to learn, if you want to get a good job, is a language that
people don't learn merely to get a job.<br><br>Only a few companies have been smart enough to realize this 
so far.  But there is a kind of selection going on here too: they're 
exactly the companies programmers would
most like to work for.  Google, for example.  When they     
advertise Java programming jobs, they also want Python experience.<br><br>A friend of mine who knows nearly all the widely used languages
uses Python for most of his projects.  He says the main reason
is that he likes the way source code looks.  That may seem
a frivolous reason to choose one language over another.
But it is not so frivolous as it sounds: when you program,
you spend more time reading code than writing it.
You push blobs of source code around the way a sculptor does
blobs of clay.  So a language that makes source code ugly is
maddening to an exacting programmer, as clay full of lumps
would be to a sculptor.<br><br>At the mention of ugly source code, people will of course think
of Perl.  But the superficial ugliness of Perl is not the sort
I mean.  Real ugliness is not harsh-looking
syntax, but having to build programs out of the wrong
concepts.  Perl may look like a cartoon character swearing,
but there are 
<a href="icad.html">cases</a> where it surpasses Python conceptually.<br><br>So far, anyway. Both languages are of course 
<a href="hundred.html">moving</a> targets.  But they
share, along with Ruby (and Icon, and Joy, and J, and Lisp,
and Smalltalk) the fact that
they're created by, and used by, people who really care about
programming.   And those tend to be the ones who do it well.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif"

Topic sentence, introductory paragraph,
supporting paragraphs, conclusion.  The conclusion being,
say, that Ahab in <i>Moby Dick</i> was a Christ-like figure.<br><br>Oy.  So I'm going to try to give the other side of the
story: what an essay really is, and how you write one.
Or at least, how I write one.<br><br><b>Mods</b><br><br>The most obvious difference between real essays and
the things one has to write in school is that real
essays are not exclusively about English literature.
Certainly schools should teach students how to
write.  But due to a series of historical accidents
the teaching of
writing has gotten mixed together with the study
of literature.  And so all over the country students are
writing not about how a baseball team with a small budget
might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in
fashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about
symbolism in Dickens.<br><br>With the result that writing is made to seem boring and
pointless.  Who cares about symbolism in Dickens?
Dickens himself would be more interested in an essay
about color or baseball.<br><br>How did things get this way?  To answer that we have to go back
almost a thousand years.  Around 1100, Europe at last began to
catch its breath after centuries of chaos, and once they
had the luxury of curiosity they rediscovered
what we call "the classics."  The effect was rather as if
we were visited by beings from another solar system.
These earlier civilizations were so much more sophisticated
that for the next several centuries the main work of
European scholars, in almost every field, was to assimilate
what they knew.<br><br>During this period the study of ancient texts acquired great
prestige.  It seemed the essence of what scholars did.  As
European scholarship gained momentum it became less and less important;
by 1350
someone who wanted to learn about science could find better
teachers than Aristotle in his own era. [1]
But schools change slower than scholarship.  In the
19th century the study of ancient texts was still the backbone
of the curriculum.<br><br>The time was then ripe for the question: if the study of
ancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not modern
texts?  The answer, of course, is that the original raison d'etre
of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaeology that
does not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors.
But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer.
The archaeological work being mostly done, it implied that
those studying the classics were, if not wasting their
time, at least working on problems of minor importance.<br><br>And so began the study of modern literature.  There was a good
deal of resistance at first.
The first courses in English literature
seem to have been offered by the newer colleges, particularly
American ones.  Dartmouth, the University of Vermont, Amherst,
and University College, London
taught English literature in the 1820s.
<!--The newly founded University
of London had the first professor of English language and literature
in 1828, and Lafayette College the second in 1857.-->
But Harvard didn't have a professor of English literature until
1876, and Oxford not till 1885. (Oxford had a chair of Chinese before
it had one of English.) [2]<br><br>What tipped the scales, at least in the US, seems to have
been the idea that professors should do research as well
as teach.  This idea (along with the PhD, the department, and
indeed the whole concept of the modern university) was imported
from Germany in the late 19th century. Beginning at
Johns Hopkins in 1876, the new model spread rapidly.<br><br>Writing was one of the casualties.  Colleges had long taught
English composition.  But how do you do research on composition?
The professors who taught math could be required to do original
math, the professors who taught history could be required to
write scholarly articles about history, but what about the  
professors who taught rhetoric or composition?  What should they
do research on?  The closest thing seemed to be English literature. [3]<br><br>And so in the late 19th century the teaching of writing was inherited
by English professors.  This had two drawbacks:
(a) an expert on literature need not himself be a good writer,
any more than an art historian has to be a good painter, and (b)
the subject of writing now tends to be literature, since that's
what the professor is interested in.<br><br>High schools imitate universities.  The seeds of our miserable
high school experiences were sown in 1892, when
the National Education Association
"formally recommended that literature
and composition be unified in the high school course." [4]
The 'riting component of the 3 Rs then morphed into English,
with the bizarre consequence that high school students now
had to write about English literature-- to write, without
even realizing it, imitations of whatever
English professors had been publishing in their journals a   
few decades before.<br><br>It's no wonder if this seems to the
student a pointless exercise, because we're now three steps
removed from real work: the students are imitating English
professors, who are imitating classical scholars, who are
merely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what
was, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.<br><br><b>No Defense</b><br><br>The other big difference between a real essay and the things
they make you write in school is that a real essay doesn't
take a position and then defend it.  That principle,
like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature,
turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long
forgotten origins.<br><br>It's often mistakenly believed that
medieval universities were mostly seminaries.  In fact they
were more law schools.  And at least in our tradition
lawyers are advocates, trained to take
either side of an argument and make as good a case for it
as they can.
Whether cause or effect, this spirit pervaded
early universities.  The study of rhetoric, the art of arguing
persuasively, was a third of the undergraduate curriculum. [5]
And after the lecture the most common form
of discussion was the disputation.  This is at least
nominally preserved in our present-day thesis defense:
most people treat the words thesis
and dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least,
a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation was
the argument by which one defended it.<br><br>Defending a position may be a necessary evil in a
legal dispute, but it's not the best way to get at the truth,
as I think lawyers would be the first to admit.  It's not
just that you miss subtleties this way.
The real problem is that you can't change the question.<br><br>And yet this principle is built into the very structure of
the things they teach you to write in high school.  The topic  
sentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the supporting
paragraphs the blows you strike in the conflict, and the
conclusion-- uh, what is the conclusion?  I was never sure
about that in high school.  It seemed as if we were just
supposed to restate what we said in the first paragraph,
but in different enough words that no one could tell.
Why bother?
But when you understand the origins
of this sort of "essay," you can see where the
conclusion comes from.  It's the concluding remarks to the   
jury.<br><br>Good writing should be convincing, certainly, but it
should be convincing because you got the right answers,
not because you did a good job of arguing.  When I give a 
draft of an essay to friends, there are two things
I want to know: which parts bore them, and which seem   
unconvincing.  The boring bits can usually be fixed by   
cutting.  But I don't try to fix the unconvincing bits by
arguing more cleverly.  I need to talk the matter over.<br><br>At the very least I must have explained something badly.  In
that case, in the course of the conversation I'll be forced
to come up a with a clearer explanation, which I can just
incorporate in the essay.  More often than not I have
to change what I was saying as well.
But the aim is never to be convincing per se.
As the reader gets smarter, convincing and true become identical,
so if I can convince smart readers I must be near the truth.<br><br>The sort of writing that attempts to persuade may be
a valid (or at least inevitable) form, but it's historically
inaccurate to call it an essay.  An essay is 
something else.<br><br><b>Trying</b><br><br>To understand what a real essay is, we have to
reach back into history again, though this time not so far.
To Michel de Montaigne, who in 1580 published a book of
what he called "essais." He was
doing something quite different from what lawyers do, and
the difference is embodied in the name.  <i>Essayer</i> is the French
verb meaning "to try"
and an <i>essai</i> is an attempt.  An essay is something you
write to try to figure something out.<br><br>Figure out what?  You don't know yet.  And so you can't begin with a
thesis, because you don't have one, and may never have
one.  An essay doesn't begin with a statement, but with a
question.  In a real essay, you don't take a position and
defend it.  You notice a door that's ajar, and you open it and
walk in to see what's inside.<br><br>If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you need
to write anything, though?  Why not just sit and think?  Well,
there precisely is Montaigne's great discovery.  Expressing    
ideas helps to form them.  Indeed, helps is far too weak a
word.  Most of what ends up in my essays I only
thought of when I sat down to write them.  That's why I   
write them.<br><br>In the things you write in school you are, in theory,
merely explaining yourself to the reader.
In a real essay you're writing for yourself.
You're thinking out loud.<br><br>But not quite.
Just as inviting people over forces you to
clean up your apartment, writing something that
other people will read forces you to think well.  So it
does matter to have an audience.  The things I've written
just for myself are no good.
They tend to peter out.  When I run into
difficulties, I find I conclude with a few vague
questions and then drift off to get a cup of tea.<br><br>Many published essays peter out in the same way.
Particularly the sort written by the staff writers 
of newsmagazines.  Outside writers tend to supply
editorials of the defend-a-position variety, which
make a beeline toward a rousing (and
foreordained) conclusion.   But the staff writers feel
obliged to write something "balanced."
Since they're writing for a popular magazine, they start with the
most radioactively controversial questions, from which-- because
they're writing for a popular magazine-- they
then proceed to recoil in terror.
Abortion, for or against?
This group says one thing.  That group says
another.  One thing is certain: the question is a
complex one.  (But don't get mad at us.  We didn't
draw any conclusions.)<br><br><b>The River</b><br><br>Questions aren't enough.  An essay has to come up with answers.
They don't always, of course.  Sometimes you start with a
promising question and get nowhere.  But those you don't   
publish.  Those are like experiments that get inconclusive
results.   An essay you publish ought to tell the reader       
something he didn't already know.<br><br>But <i>what</i> you tell him doesn't matter, so long as    
it's interesting.  I'm sometimes accused of meandering.
In defend-a-position writing that would be a flaw.
There you're not concerned with truth.  You already
know where you're going, and you want to go straight there,
blustering through obstacles, and hand-waving
your way across swampy ground.  But that's not what
you're trying to do in an essay.  An essay is supposed to
be a search for truth.  It would be suspicious if it didn't
meander.<br><br>The Meander (aka Menderes) is a river in Turkey.
As you might expect, it winds all over the place.
But it doesn't do this out of frivolity.
The path it has discovered is the most
economical route to the sea. [6]<br><br>The river's algorithm is simple.  At each step, flow down.
For the essayist this translates to: flow interesting.   
Of all the places to go next, choose the most interesting.
One can't have quite as little foresight as a river.  I always
know generally what I want to write about.
But not the
specific conclusions I want to reach; from paragraph to
paragraph I let the ideas take their course.<br><br>This doesn't always work.  Sometimes, like a river,
one runs up against a wall.  Then I do the same thing the river does:
backtrack.  At one point in this essay
I found that after following a certain thread I ran out
of ideas.  I had to go back seven paragraphs and start over
in another direction.<br><br>Fundamentally an essay is a train of thought-- but a cleaned-up
train of thought, as dialogue is cleaned-up conversation.
Real thought, like real conversation, is full of false starts.
It would be exhausting to read.  You need to 
cut and fill to
emphasize the central thread, like an
illustrator inking over a pencil drawing.  But don't
change so much that you lose the spontaneity of the original.<br><br>Err on the side of the river.  An essay is not a reference
work.  It's not something you read looking for a specific
answer, and feel cheated if you don't find it.  I'd much
rather read an essay that went off in an unexpected but
interesting direction than one that plodded dutifully along
a prescribed course.<br><br><b>Surprise</b><br><br>So what's interesting?  For me, interesting means surprise.
Interfaces, as Geoffrey James has said, should follow the principle of
least astonishment.   A button that looks like it will make a
machine stop should make it stop, not speed up.  Essays    
should do the opposite.  Essays should aim for maximum
surprise.<br><br>I was afraid of flying for a long time and could only travel
vicariously.  When friends came back from faraway places,
it wasn't just out of politeness that I asked
what they saw.  I really wanted to know.  And I found
the best way to get information out of them was to ask
what surprised them.  How was the place different from what
they expected?  This is an extremely useful question.
You can ask it of the most unobservant people, and it will 
extract information they didn't even know they were
recording.<br><br>Surprises are things that you not only didn't know, but that
contradict things you
thought you knew.  And so they're the most valuable sort of
fact you can get.  They're like a food that's not merely
healthy, but counteracts the unhealthy effects of things
you've already eaten.<br><br>How do you find surprises?  Well, therein lies half
the work of essay writing.  (The other half is expressing
yourself well.)   The trick is to use yourself as a
proxy for the reader.  You should only write about things
you've thought about a lot.  And anything you come across
that surprises you, who've thought about the topic a lot,
will probably surprise most readers.<br><br>For example, in a recent 
<a href="gh.html">essay</a> I pointed out that because
you can only judge computer programmers by working with
them, no one knows who the best programmers are overall.
I didn't realize this when I began
that essay, and even now I find it kind of weird.  That's
what you're looking for.<br><br>So if you want to write essays, you need two ingredients:
a few topics you've thought about a lot, and
some ability to ferret out the unexpected.<br><br>What should you think about?  My guess is that it
doesn't matter-- that anything can be interesting if you get deeply
enough into it.  One possible exception might be things
that have deliberately had all the variation sucked out of them,
like working in fast food.  In retrospect, was there
anything interesting about working at Baskin-Robbins?
Well, it was interesting how important color was
to the customers.  Kids a certain age would point into
the case and say that they wanted yellow.  Did they want 
French Vanilla or Lemon?  They would just look at you   
blankly.  They wanted yellow.  And then there was the  
mystery of why the perennial favorite Pralines 'n' Cream   
was so appealing.  (I think now it was the salt.)
<!--And the mystery of why Passion Fruit tasted so awful.
People would order it because of the name, and were always
disappointed.-->
And the difference in the way fathers and
mothers bought ice cream for their kids: the fathers
like benevolent kings bestowing largesse, the mothers
harried, giving in to pressure.
So, yes, there does seem to be some material even in
fast food.<br><br>I didn't notice those things at the time, though.  At sixteen
I was about as observant as a lump of rock.  I can see more now in
the fragments of memory I preserve of that age than I could see
at the time from having it all happening live, right in front of me.<br><br><b>Observation</b><br><br>So the ability to ferret out the unexpected must not merely be an
inborn one.  It must be something you can learn.
How do you learn it?<br><br>To some extent it's like learning history.
When you first read
history, it's just a whirl of names
and dates.  
Nothing seems to stick.  But the more you learn, the more hooks you have
for new facts to stick onto-- which means
you accumulate knowledge at an exponential rate.  Once you
remember that Normans conquered
England in 1066, it will catch your attention when you hear
that other Normans conquered southern Italy at about the same time.
Which will make you wonder about Normandy, and take note
when a third book mentions that Normans
were not, like most of what is now
called France, tribes that flowed in as the Roman empire collapsed,
but Vikings (norman = north man) who arrived
four centuries later in 911.  Which makes
it easier to remember that Dublin was also established by
Vikings in the 840s.  Etc, etc squared.<br><br>Collecting surprises is a similar process.
The more anomalies you've seen, the more easily you'll notice
new ones.   Which means, oddly enough, that as you grow older,
life should become more and more surprising.  When I was a
kid, I used to think adults had it all figured out.
I had it backwards.  Kids are the ones who have it all figured  
out.  They're just mistaken.<br><br>When it comes to surprises, the rich get richer.  But
(as with wealth) there
may be habits of mind that will help the process along.  It's
good to have a habit of asking questions, especially questions
beginning with Why.
But not in the random way that three year
olds ask why.  There are an infinite number of questions.
How do you find the fruitful ones?<br><br>I find it especially
useful to ask why about things that seem wrong.
For example, why should there be a connection between
humor and misfortune?  Why do we find it funny when a
character, even one we like, slips on a banana peel?
There's a whole essay's worth of surprises there for sure.<br><br>If you want to notice things that seem wrong, you'll find a
degree of skepticism helpful.  I take it as an axiom
that we're only achieving 1% of what we could.
This helps counteract the rule that gets beaten into our
heads as children: that things are the way they are because
that is how things have to be.
For example, everyone I've talked to while writing this essay  
felt the same about
English classes-- that the whole process seemed pointless.
But none of us had the balls at the time to hypothesize that
it was, in fact, all a mistake.
We all thought there was just something we weren't getting.<br><br>I have a hunch you want to pay attention not just to things
that seem wrong, but things that seem wrong in a humorous way.  
I'm always pleased when I see someone laugh as they
read a draft of an essay.  But why should I be?  I'm aiming
for good ideas.  Why should good ideas be funny?
The connection may be surprise.
Surprises make us laugh, and surprises are what
one wants to deliver.<br><br>I write down things that surprise me in notebooks.  I never
actually get around to reading them and using
what I've written, but I do tend to
reproduce the same thoughts later.  So the main value
of notebooks may be what writing things down leaves in your
head.<br><br>People trying to be cool will find themselves at a disadvantage
when collecting surprises.  To be surprised is to be mistaken.
And the essence of cool, as any fourteen year old could tell
you, is <i>nil admirari.</i>  When you're mistaken, don't
dwell on it; just act like nothing's wrong and maybe no one
will notice.<br><br>One of the keys to coolness is to avoid situations where
inexperience may make you look foolish. 
If you want to find surprises you should do the opposite.
Study lots of different things,
because some of the most interesting surprises are unexpected
connections between different fields.  For example, 
jam, bacon, pickles, and cheese, which are among the most pleasing
of foods, were all originally intended as methods of preservation.
And so were books and paintings.<br><br>Whatever you study, include history-- but social and economic
history, not political history.  History seems to me so important
that it's misleading to treat it as a mere field of study.
Another way to describe it is <i>all the data we have so far.</i><br><br>Among other things, studying history gives one confidence that
there are good ideas waiting to be discovered right under our noses.
Swords evolved during the Bronze Age out of daggers, which
(like their flint predecessors) had a hilt separate from the
blade.  Because swords are longer
the hilts kept breaking off.  But it took five hundred years
before someone thought of casting hilt and blade as one
piece.<br><br><b>Disobedience</b><br><br>Above all, make a habit of paying
attention to things you're not supposed to, either because 
they're "<a href="say.html">inappropriate</a>," 
or not important, or not what you're
supposed to be working on.  If you're curious about something,
trust your instincts.
Follow the threads that attract your
attention.  If there's something you're really interested
in, you'll find they have an uncanny way of leading back to
it anyway, just as the conversation of people who are especially
proud of something always tends to lead back to it.<br><br>For example, I've always been fascinated by comb-overs, especially
the extreme sort that
make a man look as if he's wearing a beret made of his own hair.
Surely this is a lowly sort of thing to be interested in-- the
sort of superficial quizzing
best left to teenage girls.  And yet there is something underneath.
The key question, I realized, is how does the comber-over not
see how odd he looks?
And the answer is that he got to look that way <i>incrementally.</i>
What began as combing his hair a little carefully over a
thin patch has gradually, over 20 years, grown into a monstrosity.
Gradualness is very powerful.  And that power can be
used for constructive purposes too: just as you can trick
yourself into looking like a freak, you can trick yourself into
creating something so grand that you would never have dared to
<i>plan</i> such a thing.  Indeed, this is just how most good
software gets created.  You start by writing a stripped-down
kernel (how hard can it be?) and gradually it grows
into a complete operating system.  Hence the next leap: could
you do the same thing in painting, or in a novel?<br><br>See what you can extract from a frivolous question?
If there's one piece of advice I would give about writing essays,
it would be: don't do as you're told.
Don't believe what you're supposed to.
Don't write the
essay readers expect; one learns nothing from
what one expects.
And
don't write the way they taught you to in school.<br><br>The most important sort of disobedience is to write
essays at all.  Fortunately, this sort of disobedience shows
signs of becoming 
<a href="http://www.ojr.org/ojr/glaser/1056050270.php">rampant</a>. 
It used to be that only a tiny
number of officially approved writers were allowed to
write essays.  Magazines published few of them, and judged
them less by what they said than who wrote them;
a magazine might publish a story by an
unknown writer if it was good enough, but if they published
an essay on x it had to be by someone who was at least
forty and whose job title had x in it.  Which is a problem,
because there are a lot of things insiders can't say precisely
because they're insiders.<br><br>The Internet is changing that.
Anyone can publish an essay on the Web, and it gets judged, as any
writing should, by what it says, not who wrote it.
Who are you to write about x?  You are whatever you wrote.<br><br>Popular magazines made the period between the spread
of literacy and the arrival of TV the golden age of the
short story.
The Web may well make this the golden age of the essay.
And that's certainly not something I realized when
I started writing this.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] I'm thinking of Oresme (c. 1323-82).  But it's hard to pick
a date, because there was a sudden drop-off in scholarship
just as Europeans finished assimilating classical science.
The cause may have been the plague of 1347; the trend in
scientific progress matches the population curve.<br><br>[2] Parker, William R. "Where Do College English Departments

At first
literature took a back seat to philology, which (a) seemed more 
serious and (b) was popular in Germany, where many of the
leading scholars of that generation had been trained.<br><br>In some cases the writing teachers were transformed
<i>in situ</i> into English professors.
Francis James Child, who had been Boylston Professor
of Rhetoric at Harvard since 1851,
became in 1876 the university's first professor of English.<br><br>[4] Parker, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 25.<br><br>[5] The undergraduate curriculum or <i>trivium</i> (whence
"trivial") consisted of Latin grammar, rhetoric, and logic.  
Candidates for masters' degrees went on to study the
<i>quadrivium</i> of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.
Together these were the seven liberal arts.<br><br>The study of rhetoric was inherited directly from Rome, where
it was considered the most important
subject.  It would not be far from the truth to say that  
education in the classical world
meant training landowners' sons
to speak well enough to defend their interests
in political and legal disputes.<br><br>[6] Trevor Blackwell points out that this
isn't strictly true, because the outside  
edges of curves erode faster.<br><br><!--[9] When I first heard about blogs, I imagined they would be a
complete waste of time.  Blogging sounded like a long-play version 
of netnews.  But I was mistaken; people care more about something
that stays on their site, and the Web supplies a filter that's  
missing in newsgroups.
The best writing online
is not only better than netnews, but better than most print media.-->

because I worked at Yahoo during 1998 and 1999.  One day,
when the stock was trading around $200, I sat down and calculated
what I thought the price should be. The 
answer I got was $12.  I went to
the next cubicle and told my friend Trevor.  "Twelve!" he said.
He tried to sound indignant, but he didn't quite manage it.  He
knew as well as I did that our valuation was crazy.<br><br>Yahoo was a special case.  It was not just our price to earnings
ratio that was bogus.  Half our earnings were too.  Not in
the Enron way, of course.  The finance guys seemed
scrupulous about reporting earnings.  What made our
earnings bogus was that Yahoo was, in effect, the center of
a Ponzi scheme.  Investors looked at Yahoo's earnings
and said to themselves, here is proof that Internet companies can make
money.  So they invested in new
startups that promised to be the next Yahoo.  And as soon as these startups
got the money, what did they do with it?
Buy millions of dollars worth of advertising on Yahoo to promote
their brand.  Result: a capital investment in a startup this
quarter shows up as Yahoo earnings next quarter—stimulating
another round of investments in startups.<br><br>As in a Ponzi scheme, what seemed to be the returns of this system
were simply the latest round of investments in it.
What made it not a Ponzi scheme was that it was unintentional.  
At least, I think it was.  The venture capital business is pretty incestuous,
and there were presumably people in a position, if not to create
this situation, to realize what was happening and to milk it.<br><br>A year later the game was up.  Starting in January 2000, Yahoo's
stock price began to crash, ultimately losing 95% of its
value.<br><br>Notice, though, that even with all the fat trimmed off its market
cap, Yahoo was still worth a lot.  Even at the morning-after
valuations of March and April 2001, the people at Yahoo had managed
to create a company worth about $8 billion in just six years.<br><br>The fact is, despite all the nonsense we heard
during the Bubble about the "new economy," there was a
core of truth.  You need
that to get a really big bubble: you need to have something
solid at the center, so that even smart people are sucked in.
(Isaac Newton and Jonathan Swift both lost money
in the South Sea Bubble of 1720.)<br><br>Now the pendulum has swung the other way.  Now anything that
became fashionable during the Bubble is ipso facto unfashionable.
But that's a mistake—an even bigger mistake than believing
what everyone was saying in 1999.  Over the long term,
what the Bubble got right will be more important than what
it got wrong.<br><br><b>1. Retail VC</b><br><br>After the excesses of the Bubble, it's now
considered dubious to take companies public before they have earnings.
But there is nothing intrinsically wrong with
that idea.  Taking a company public at an early stage is simply
retail VC: instead of going to venture capital firms for the last round of
funding, you go to the public markets.<br><br>By the end of the Bubble, companies going public with no
earnings were being derided as "concept stocks," as if it
were inherently stupid to invest in them.
But investing in concepts isn't stupid; it's what VCs do,
and the best of them are far from stupid.<br><br>The stock of a company that doesn't yet have earnings is  
worth <i>something.</i>
It may take a while for the market to learn
how to value such companies, just as it had to learn to
value common stocks in the early 20th century.   But markets
are good at solving that kind of problem.  I wouldn't be
surprised if the market ultimately did a better
job than VCs do now.<br><br>Going public early will not be the right plan
for every company.
And it can of course be
disruptive—by distracting the management, or by making the early
employees suddenly rich.  But just as the market will learn
how to value startups, startups will learn how to minimize
the damage of going public.<br><br><b>2. The Internet</b><br><br>The Internet genuinely is a big deal.  That was one reason
even smart people were fooled by the Bubble.  Obviously 
it was going to have a huge effect.  Enough of an effect to
triple the value of Nasdaq companies in two years?  No, as it
turned out.  But it was hard to say for certain at the time. [1]<br><br>The same thing happened during the Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles.
What drove them was the invention of organized public finance
(the South Sea Company, despite its name, was really a competitor
of the Bank of England).  And that did turn out to be
a big deal, in the long run.<br><br>Recognizing an important trend turns out to be easier than 
figuring out how to profit from it.  The mistake
investors always seem to make is to take the trend too literally.
Since the Internet was the big new thing, investors supposed
that the more Internettish the company, the better.  Hence
such parodies as Pets.Com.<br><br>In fact most of the money to be made from big trends is made
indirectly.  It was not the railroads themselves that 
made the most money during the railroad boom, but the companies
on either side, like Carnegie's steelworks, which made the rails,
and Standard Oil, which used railroads to get oil to the East Coast,
where it could be shipped to Europe.<br><br>I think the Internet will have great effects,
and that what we've seen so far is nothing compared to what's
coming.  But most of the winners will only indirectly be
Internet companies; for every Google there will be ten
JetBlues.<br><br><b>3. Choices</b><br><br>Why will the Internet have great effects?  The general   
argument is that new forms of communication always do.  They happen
rarely (till industrial times there were just speech, writing, and printing),
but when they do, they always cause a big splash.<br><br>The specific argument, or one of them, is the Internet gives us  
more choices.  In the "old" economy,
the high cost of presenting information to people meant they
had only a narrow range of options to choose from.  The tiny,
expensive pipeline to consumers was tellingly named "the channel."
Control the channel and you
could feed them what you wanted, on your terms.  And it
was not just big corporations that depended
on this principle.  So, in their way, did
labor unions, the traditional news media,
and the art and literary establishments.
Winning depended not on doing good work, but on gaining control
of some bottleneck.<br><br>There are signs that this is changing.
Google has over 82 million unique users a month and
annual revenues of about three billion dollars. [2]
And yet have you ever seen
a Google ad?
Something is going on here.<br><br>Admittedly, Google is an extreme case.  It's very easy for
people to switch to a new search engine.  It costs little
effort and no money to try a new one, and it's easy to
see if the results are better.  And so Google doesn't <i>have</i>
to advertise.  In a business like theirs, being the best is
enough.<br><br>The exciting thing about the Internet is that it's
shifting everything in that direction.
The hard part, if you want to win by making the best stuff,
is the beginning.  Eventually everyone
will learn by word of mouth that you're the best,
but how do you survive to that point?  And it is in this crucial
stage that the Internet has the most effect.  First, the
Internet lets anyone find you at almost zero cost.
Second, it dramatically speeds up the rate at which
reputation spreads by word of mouth.  Together these mean that in many
fields the rule will be: Build it, and they will come.
Make something great and put it online.
That is a big change from the recipe for winning in the
past century.<br><br><b>4. Youth</b><br><br>The aspect of the Internet Bubble that the press seemed most
taken with was the youth of some of the startup founders.
This too is a trend that will last.
There is a huge standard deviation among 26 year olds.  Some
are fit only for entry level jobs, but others are
ready to rule the world if they can find someone to handle
the paperwork for them.<br><br>A 26 year old may not be very good at managing people or
dealing with the SEC.  Those require experience.
But those are also commodities, which can be handed off to
some lieutenant.  The most important quality in a CEO is his
vision for the company's future.  What will they build next?
And in that department, there are 26 year olds who can
compete with anyone.<br><br>In 1970 a company president meant someone in his fifties, at
least.   If he had technologists working for him, they were 
treated like a racing stable: prized, but not powerful.  But 
as technology has grown more important, the power of nerds
has grown to reflect it.  Now it's not enough for a CEO to
have someone smart he can ask about technical matters.   Increasingly,
he has to be that person himself.<br><br>As always, business has clung to old forms.  VCs still seem
to want to install a legitimate-looking 
talking head as the CEO.  But increasingly the founders of
the company are the real powers, and the grey-headed man
installed by the VCs more like a
music group's manager than a general.<br><br><b>5. Informality</b><br><br>In New York, the Bubble had dramatic consequences:
suits went out of fashion.  They made one seem old.  So in
1998 powerful New York types were suddenly wearing
open-necked shirts and khakis and oval wire-rimmed glasses,
just like guys in Santa Clara.<br><br>The pendulum has swung back a bit, driven in part by a panicked
reaction by the clothing industry.  But I'm betting on the
open-necked shirts.  And this is not as frivolous a question
as it might seem.  Clothes are important, as all nerds can sense,
though they may not realize it consciously.<br><br>If you're a nerd, you can understand how important clothes are
by asking yourself how you'd feel about a company
that made you wear a suit and tie to work.  The idea sounds
horrible, doesn't it?  In fact, horrible far out of proportion
to the mere discomfort of wearing such clothes.  A company that
made programmers wear suits would have something deeply wrong
with it.<br><br>And what would be wrong would be that how one presented oneself
counted more than the quality of one's ideas.  <i>That's</i>
the problem with formality.  Dressing up is not so much bad in
itself.  The problem is the receptor it binds to: dressing
up is inevitably a substitute
for good ideas.   It is no coincidence that technically
inept business types are known as "suits."<br><br>Nerds don't just happen to dress informally.  They do it too
consistently.  Consciously or not, they dress informally as
a prophylactic measure against stupidity.<br><br><b>6. Nerds</b><br><br>Clothing is only the most visible battleground in the war
against formality.  Nerds tend to eschew formality of any sort.
They're not impressed by one's job title, for example,
or any of the other appurtenances of authority.<br><br>Indeed, that's practically the definition of a nerd.  I found
myself talking recently to someone from Hollywood who was planning
a show about nerds.  I thought it would be useful if I
explained what a nerd was.  What I came up with was: someone who
doesn't expend any effort on marketing himself.<br><br>A nerd, in other words, is someone who concentrates on substance.
So what's the connection between nerds and technology? Roughly
that you can't fool mother nature. In technical matters, you
have to get the right answers.  If your software miscalculates
the path of a space probe, you can't finesse your way out of
trouble by saying that your code is patriotic, or avant-garde,
or any of the other dodges people use in nontechnical
fields.<br><br>And as technology becomes increasingly important in the
economy, nerd culture is 
<a href="nerdad.html">rising</a> with it.  Nerds are already
a lot cooler than they were when I was a kid.  When I was in
college in the mid-1980s, "nerd" was still an insult.  People
who majored in computer science generally tried to conceal it.
Now women ask me where they can meet nerds.  (The answer that
springs to mind is "Usenix," but that would be like drinking
from a firehose.)<br><br>I have no illusions about why nerd culture is becoming
more accepted.  It's not because people are
realizing that substance is more important than marketing.
It's because the nerds are getting 
rich.  But that is not going
to change.<br><br><b>7. Options</b><br><br>What makes the nerds rich, usually, is stock options.  Now there
are moves afoot to make it harder for companies to grant   
options.  To the extent there's some genuine accounting abuse 
going on, by all means correct it.  But don't kill the golden  
goose.  Equity is the fuel that drives technical innovation.<br><br>Options are a good idea because (a) they're fair, and (b) they
work.  Someone who goes to work for a company is (one hopes)   
adding to its value, and it's only fair to give them a share
of it.  And as a purely practical measure, people work a <i>lot</i>
harder when they have options.  I've seen that first hand.<br><br>The fact that a few crooks during the Bubble robbed their
companies by granting themselves options doesn't mean options
are a bad idea.  During the railroad boom, some executives
enriched themselves by selling watered stock—by issuing more
shares than they said were outstanding.  But that doesn't  
make common stock a bad idea.  Crooks just use whatever
means are available.<br><br>If there is a problem with options, it's that they reward
slightly the wrong thing.  Not surprisingly, people do what you
pay them to. If you pay them by the hour, they'll work a lot of
hours.  If you pay them by the volume of work done, they'll
get a lot of work done (but only as you defined work).
And if you pay them to raise the
stock price, which is what options amount to, they'll raise
the stock price.<br><br>But that's not quite what you want.  What you want is to
increase the actual value of the company, not its market cap.
Over time the two inevitably meet, but not always as quickly
as options vest.  Which means options tempt employees, if
only unconsciously, to "pump and dump"—to do things
that will make the company <i>seem</i> valuable.
I found that when I was at Yahoo, I couldn't help thinking,   
"how will this sound to investors?"  when I should have been
thinking "is this a good idea?"<br><br>So maybe the standard option deal needs to be tweaked slightly.
Maybe options should be replaced with something tied more
directly to earnings.  It's still early days.<br><br><b>8. Startups</b><br><br>What made the options valuable, for the most part, is
that they were options on the stock of 
<a href="start.html">startups</a>.  Startups   
were not of course a creation of the Bubble, but they
were more visible during the Bubble than ever before.<br><br>One thing most people did learn about for the first time
during the Bubble was the startup
created with the intention of selling it.
Originally a
startup meant a small company that hoped to grow into a
big one.  But increasingly startups are evolving into a
vehicle for developing technology on spec.<br><br>As I wrote in
<a href="hackpaint.html">Hackers &amp; Painters</a>, employees seem to be most
productive when they're paid in proportion to the wealth
they generate.  And the advantage of a startup—indeed,   
almost its raison d'etre—is that it offers something
otherwise impossible to obtain: a way of <i>measuring</i> that.<br><br>In many businesses, it just makes more sense for companies
to get technology by buying startups rather than developing   
it in house.  You pay more, but there is less risk,
and risk is what big companies don't want.  It makes the
guys developing the technology more accountable, because they
only get paid if they build the winner.  And you end up   
with better technology, created faster, because things are
made in the innovative atmosphere of startups instead of 
the bureaucratic atmosphere of big companies.<br><br>Our startup, Viaweb, was built to be sold.  We were open
with investors about that from the start.  And we were     
careful to create something that could slot easily into a
larger company.  That is the pattern for the future.<br><br><b>9. California</b><br><br>The Bubble was a California phenomenon.  When I showed up
in Silicon Valley in 1998, I felt like an immigrant from
Eastern Europe arriving in America in 1900.  Everyone
was so cheerful and healthy and rich.  It seemed a new
and improved world.<br><br>The press, ever eager to exaggerate small trends, now gives  
one the impression that Silicon Valley is a ghost town.
Not at all.  When I drive down 101 from the airport,
I still feel a buzz of energy, as if there were a giant
transformer nearby.  Real estate is still more expensive
than just about anywhere else in the country.  The people     
still look healthy, and the weather is still fabulous.
The future is there.
(I say "there" because I moved back to the East Coast after
Yahoo.  I still wonder if this was a smart idea.)<br><br>What makes the Bay Area superior is the attitude of the
people.  I notice that when I come home to Boston.
The first thing I see when I walk out of the airline terminal
is the fat, grumpy guy in
charge of the taxi line.  I brace myself for rudeness:
<i>remember, you're back on the East Coast now.</i><br><br>The atmosphere varies from city to city, and fragile
organisms like startups are exceedingly sensitive to such variation.
If it hadn't already been hijacked as a new euphemism
for liberal, the word to describe the atmosphere in
the Bay Area would be "progressive."  People there are trying
to build the future.
Boston has MIT and Harvard, but it also has a lot of
truculent, unionized employees like the police who
recently held the Democratic National Convention for   
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-04-30-boston-police-convention_x.htm">ransom</a>, and a lot of people trying to be
 Thurston Howell.
Two sides of an obsolete coin.<br><br>Silicon Valley may not be the next Paris or London, but it
is at least the next Chicago.  For the next fifty years,   
that's where new wealth will come from.<br><br><b>10. Productivity</b><br><br>During the Bubble, optimistic analysts used to justify high
price to earnings ratios by saying that technology was going 
to increase productivity dramatically.  They were wrong about
the specific companies, but not so wrong about the underlying
principle.  I think one of the big trends we'll see in the
coming century is a huge increase in productivity.<br><br>Or more precisely, a huge increase in <a href="gh.html">variation</a> in
productivity.  Technology is a lever.  It doesn't add;     
it multiplies.  If the present range of productivity is  
0 to 100, introducing a multiple of 10 increases the range
from 0 to 1000.<br><br>One upshot of which is that the companies of the future may
be surprisingly small.  I sometimes daydream about how big
you could grow a company (in revenues) without ever having
more than ten people.  What would happen if you outsourced
everything except product development?  If you tried this experiment,
I think you'd be surprised at how far you could get. 
As Fred Brooks pointed out, small groups are
intrinsically more productive, because the
internal friction in a group grows as the
square of its size.<br><br>Till quite recently, running a major company
meant managing an army of workers.  Our standards about how
many employees a company should have are still influenced by
old patterns.  Startups are perforce small, because they can't
afford to hire a lot of people.  But I think it's a big mistake for
companies to loosen their belts as revenues increase.  The
question is not whether you can afford the extra salaries.   
Can you afford the loss in productivity that comes from making
the company bigger?<br><br>The prospect of technological leverage will of course raise the
specter of unemployment.  I'm surprised people still worry about
this.
After centuries of supposedly job-killing innovations,
the number of jobs is within ten percent of the number of people
who want them.  This can't be a coincidence.  There must be some
kind of balancing mechanism.<br><br><b>What's New</b><br><br>When one looks over these trends, is there any overall theme?
There does seem to be: that in the coming century, good ideas
will count for more.  That 26
year olds with good ideas will increasingly have an edge over 50
year olds with powerful connections.  That doing good work will
matter more than dressing up—or advertising, which is the
same thing for companies.  That people
will be rewarded a bit more in proportion to the value of what
they create.<br><br>If so, this is good news indeed.
Good ideas always tend to win eventually.  The problem is,
it can take a very long time.
It took decades for relativity to be accepted, and the
greater part of a century to establish that central planning didn't work.
So even a small increase in the
rate at which good ideas win would be a momentous
change—big enough, probably, to justify a name like
the "new economy."<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] Actually it's hard to say now.  As Jeremy Siegel points
out, if the value of a stock is its future earnings, you 
can't tell if it was overvalued till you see what the earnings
turn out to be.   While certain famous Internet stocks were
almost certainly overvalued in 1999, it is still hard to say for sure
whether, e.g., the Nasdaq index was.<br><br>Siegel, Jeremy J.  "What Is an Asset Price Bubble?  An

I thought it would be interesting to compare a finished
essay with the first version to see how much of the original  
text survives.
-->
As E. B. White said, "good writing is rewriting."  I didn't
realize this when I was in school.  In writing, as in math and 
science, they only show you the finished product.
You don't see all the false starts.  This gives students a
misleading view of how things get made.<br><br>Part of the reason it happens is that writers don't want   
people to see their mistakes.  But I'm willing to let people
see an early draft if it will show how much you have
to rewrite to beat an essay into shape.<br><br>Below is the oldest version I can find of
<a href="essay.html">The Age of the Essay</a>   
(probably the second or third day), with
text that ultimately survived in 
<font color="#aa0000">red</font> and text that later
got deleted in <font color="#777777">gray</font>.
There seem to be several categories of cuts: things I got wrong,
things that seem like bragging, flames,
digressions, stretches of awkward prose, and unnecessary words.<br><br>I discarded more from the beginning.  That's
not surprising; it takes a while to hit your stride.  There
are more digressions at the start, because I'm not sure where
I'm heading.<br><br>The amount of cutting is about average.  I probably write
three to four words for every one that appears in the final
version of an essay.<br><br>(Before anyone gets mad at me for opinions expressed here, remember
that anything you see here that's not in the final version is obviously
something I chose not to publish, often because I disagree
with it.)<br><br><br><br><font color="#777777">
Recently a friend said that what he liked about
my essays was that they weren't written the way
we'd been taught to write essays in school.  You
remember: <font color="#aa0000">topic sentence, introductory paragraph,
supporting paragraphs, conclusion.</font>  It hadn't
occurred to me till then that those horrible things
we had to write in school were even connected to
what I was doing now.  But sure enough, I thought,
they did call them "essays," didn't they?<br><br>Well, they're not.  Those things you have to write
in school are not only not essays, they're one of the
most pointless of all the pointless hoops you have
to jump through in school.  And I worry that they
not only teach students the wrong things about writing,
but put them off writing entirely.<br><br><font color="#aa0000">So I'm going to give the other side of the story: what
an essay really is, and how you write one.  Or at least,
how I write one.</font>  Students be forewarned: if you actually write
the kind of essay I describe, you'll probably get bad
grades.  But knowing how it's really done should
at least help you to understand the feeling of futility
you have when you're writing the things they tell you to.<br><br><font color="#aa0000">
The most obvious difference between real essays and
the things one has to write in school is that real
essays are not exclusively about English literature.</font>
It's a fine thing for schools to
<font color="#aa0000">
teach students how to
write.</font>  But for some bizarre reason (actually, a very specific bizarre
reason that I'll explain in a moment),
<font color="#aa0000">
the teaching of
writing has gotten mixed together with the study
of literature.  And so all over the country, students are
writing not about how a baseball team with a small budget 
might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in
fashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about
symbolism in Dickens.</font><br><br><font color="#aa0000">With</font> obvious 
<font color="#aa0000">result</font>s.  Only a few people really
<font color="#aa0000">
care about
symbolism in Dickens.</font>  The teacher doesn't.
The students don't.  Most of the people who've had to write PhD
disserations about Dickens don't.  And certainly
<font color="#aa0000">
Dickens himself would be more interested in an essay
about color or baseball.<br><br>How did things get this way?  To answer that we have to go back
almost a thousand years.</font>  Between about 500 and 1000, life was
not very good in Europe.  The term "dark ages" is presently
out of fashion as too judgemental (the period wasn't dark; 
it was just <i>different</i>), but if this label didn't already
exist, it would seem an inspired metaphor.  What little
original thought there was took place in lulls between
constant wars and had something of the character of
the thoughts of parents with a new baby.
The most amusing thing written during this
period, Liudprand of Cremona's Embassy to Constantinople, is,
I suspect, mostly inadvertantly so.<br><br>Around 1000 <font color="#aa0000">Europe began to catch its breath.
And once they
had the luxury of curiosity,</font> one of the first things they discovered
was <font color="#aa0000">what we call "the classics."</font>
Imagine if <font color="#aa0000">we were visited  
by</font> aliens.  If they could even get here they'd presumably know a
few things we don't.  Immediately Alien Studies would become
the most dynamic field of scholarship: instead of painstakingly
discovering things for ourselves, we could simply suck up
everything they'd discovered.  So it was in Europe in 1200.
When classical texts began to circulate in Europe, they contained
not just new answers, but new questions.  (If anyone proved
a theorem in christian Europe before 1200, for example, there
is no record of it.)<br><br>For a couple centuries, some of the most important work
being done was intellectual archaelogy.  Those were also
the centuries during which schools were first established.
And since reading ancient texts was the <font color="#aa0000">essence of what
scholars did</font> then, it became the basis of the curriculum.<br><br>By 1700, <font color="#aa0000">someone who wanted to learn about</font>
physics didn't need to start by mastering Greek in order to read <font color="#aa0000">Aristotle.  But schools
change slower than scholarship</font>: <font color="#aa0000">the study of
ancient texts</font>
had such prestige that it remained <font color="#aa0000">the backbone of</font> 
education
until the late 19th century.  By then it was merely a tradition.
It did serve some purposes: reading a foreign language was difficult,
and thus taught discipline, or at least, kept students busy;
it introduced students to
cultures quite different from their own; and its very uselessness
made it function (like white gloves) as a social bulwark.
But it certainly wasn't
true, and hadn't been true for centuries, that students were
serving apprenticeships in the hottest area of scholarship.<br><br>Classical scholarship had also changed.  In the early era, philology
actually mattered.  The texts that filtered into Europe were
all corrupted to some degree by the errors of translators and
copyists.  Scholars had to figure out what Aristotle said
before they could figure out what he meant.  But by the modern
era such questions were answered as well as they were ever
going to be.  And so the study of ancient texts became less
about ancientness and more about texts.<br><br><font color="#aa0000">The time was then ripe for the question: if the study of
ancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not modern
texts?  The answer, of course, is that the raison d'etre
of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual archaelogy that
does not need to be done in the case of contemporary authors.
But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that answer.
The archaeological work being mostly done, it implied that
the people studying the classics were, if not wasting their
time, at least working on problems of minor importance.<br><br>And so began the study of modern literature. There was</font> some
initial <font color="#aa0000">resistance</font>, but it didn't last long.
The limiting
reagent in the growth of university departments is what
parents will let undergraduates study.  If parents will let
their children major in x, the rest follows straightforwardly.
There will be jobs teaching x, and professors to fill them.
The professors will establish scholarly journals and publish
one another's papers.  Universities with x departments will
subscribe to the journals.  Graduate students who want jobs
as professors of x will write dissertations about it.  It may
take a good long while for the more prestigious universities
to cave in and establish departments in cheesier xes,  but
at the other end of the scale there are so many universities
competing to attract students that the mere establishment of
a discipline requires little more than the desire to do it.<br><br><font color="#aa0000">High schools imitate universities.</font>
And so once university
English departments were established in the late nineteenth century,
<font color="#aa0000">the 'riting component of the 3 Rs</font> 
was <font color="#aa0000">morphed into English.
With the bizarre consequence that high school students now
had to write about English literature-- to write, without
even realizing it, imitations of whatever
English professors had been publishing in their journals a
few decades before.   It's no wonder if this seems to the
student a pointless exercise, because we're now three steps
removed from real work: the students are imitating English
professors, who are imitating classical scholars, who are
merely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what
was, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work.</font><br><br>Perhaps high schools should drop English and just teach writing.
The valuable part of English classes is learning to write, and
that could be taught better by itself.  Students learn better
when they're interested in what they're doing, and it's hard
to imagine a topic less interesting than symbolism in Dickens.
Most of the people who write about that sort of thing professionally
are not really interested in it.  (Though indeed, it's been a
while since they were writing about symbolism; now they're
writing about gender.)<br><br>I have no illusions about how eagerly this suggestion will  
be adopted.  Public schools probably couldn't stop teaching
English even if they wanted to; they're probably required to by
law.  But here's a related suggestion that goes with the grain
instead of against it: that universities establish a
writing major.  Many of the students who now major in English
would major in writing if they could, and most would
be better off.<br><br>It will be argued that it is a good thing for students to be
exposed to their literary heritage.  Certainly.  But is that
more important than that they learn to write well?  And are
English classes even the place to do it?  After all,
the average public high school student gets zero exposure to  
his artistic heritage.  No disaster results.
The people who are interested in art learn about it for
themselves, and those who aren't don't.  I find that American
adults are no better or worse informed about literature than
art, despite the fact that they spent years studying literature
in high school and no time at all studying art.  Which presumably
means that what they're taught in school is rounding error 
compared to what they pick up on their own.<br><br>Indeed, English classes may even be harmful.  In my case they
were effectively aversion therapy.  Want to make someone dislike
a book?  Force him to read it and write an essay about it.
And make the topic so intellectually bogus that you
could not, if asked, explain why one ought to write about it.
I love to read more than anything, but by the end of high school
I never read the books we were assigned.  I was so disgusted with
what we were doing that it became a point of honor
with me to write nonsense at least as good at the other students'
without having more than glanced over the book to learn the names
of the characters and a few random events in it.<br><br>I hoped this might be fixed in college, but I found the same
problem there.  It was not the teachers.  It was English.   
We were supposed to read novels and write essays about them.
About what, and why?  That no one seemed to be able to explain.
Eventually by trial and error I found that what the teacher  
wanted us to do was pretend that the story had really taken
place, and to analyze based on what the characters said and did (the
subtler clues, the better) what their motives must have been.
One got extra credit for motives having to do with class,
as I suspect one must now for those involving gender and  
sexuality.  I learned how to churn out such stuff well enough
to get an A, but I never took another English class.<br><br>And the books we did these disgusting things to, like those
we mishandled in high school, I find still have black marks
against them in my mind.  The one saving grace was that   
English courses tend to favor pompous, dull writers like
Henry James, who deserve black marks against their names anyway.
One of the principles the IRS uses in deciding whether to
allow deductions is that, if something is fun, it isn't work.
Fields that are intellectually unsure of themselves rely on
a similar principle.  Reading P.G. Wodehouse or Evelyn Waugh or
Raymond Chandler is too obviously pleasing to seem like
serious work, as reading Shakespeare would have been before 
English evolved enough to make it an effort to understand him. [sh]
And so good writers (just you wait and see who's still in
print in 300 years) are less likely to have readers turned   
against them by clumsy, self-appointed tour guides.<br><br>
<font color="#aa0000">The other big difference between a real essay and the 
things
they make you write in school is that a real essay doesn't 
take a position and then defend it.  That principle,
like the idea that we ought to be writing about literature,   
turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long
forgotten origins.  It's often mistakenly believed that
medieval universities were mostly seminaries.  In fact they
were more law schools.  And at least in our tradition
lawyers are advocates</font>: they are
<font color="#aa0000">trained to</font> be able to
<font color="#aa0000">take
either side of an argument and make as good a case for it  
as they can. </font><br><br>Whether or not this is a good idea (in the case of prosecutors,
it probably isn't), it tended to <font color="#aa0000">pervade</font>
the atmosphere of
<font color="#aa0000">early universities.  After the lecture the most common form
of discussion was the disputation.  This</font> idea
<font color="#aa0000">is at least
nominally preserved in our present-day thesis defense</font>-- indeed,
in the very word thesis.  <font color="#aa0000">Most people treat the words 
thesis
and dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at least,
a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation was
the argument by which one defended it.</font><br><br>I'm not complaining that we blur these two words together.
As far as I'm concerned, the sooner we lose the original
sense of the word thesis, the better.  For many, perhaps most,  
graduate students, it is stuffing a square peg into a round
hole to try to recast one's work as a single thesis.  And
as for the disputation, that seems clearly a net lose.
Arguing two sides of a case <font color="#aa0000">may be a necessary evil in a
legal dispute, but it's not the best way to get at the truth,
as I think lawyers would be the first to admit.</font><br><br><font color="#aa0000">
And yet this principle is built into the very structure of  
the</font> essays
<font color="#aa0000">they teach you to write in high school.  The topic
sentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the supporting 
paragraphs the blows you strike in the conflict, and the
conclusion--- uh, what it the conclusion?  I was never sure  
about that in high school.</font>  If your thesis was well expressed,
what need was there to restate it?  In theory it seemed that
the conclusion of a really good essay ought not to need to   
say any more than QED.
<font color="#aa0000">But when you understand the origins
of this sort of "essay", you can see where the
conclusion comes from.  It's the concluding remarks to the 
jury.</font><br><br>
What other alternative is there?  To answer that
<font color="#aa0000">we have to
reach back into history again, though this time not so far.
To Michel de Montaigne,</font> inventor of the essay.
<font color="#aa0000">He was
doing something quite different from what</font> a
<font color="#aa0000">lawyer do</font>es,
<font color="#aa0000">and
the difference is embodied in the name.  Essayer is the French
verb meaning "to try"</font> (the cousin of our word assay),
<font color="#aa0000">
and an "essai" is an</font> effort.
<font color="#aa0000">An essay is something you
write</font> in order
<font color="#aa0000">to figure something out.<br><br>Figure out what?  You don't know yet.  And so you can't begin with a
thesis, because you don't have one, and may never have 
one.  An essay doesn't begin with a statement, but with a  
question.  In a real essay, you don't take a position and
defend it.  You see a door that's ajar, and you open it and
walk in to see what's inside.<br><br>If all you want to do is figure things out, why do you need
to write anything, though?  Why not just sit and think?  Well,
there precisely is Montaigne's great discovery.  Expressing
ideas helps to form them.  Indeed, helps is far too weak a
word.</font>  90%
<font color="#aa0000">of what ends up in my essays</font> was stuff
<font color="#aa0000">I only
thought of when I sat down to write them.  That's why I
write them.</font><br><br>So there's another difference between essays and
<font color="#aa0000">the things
you have to write in school</font>.   In school
<font color="#aa0000">
you are, in theory,
explaining yourself to</font> someone else.  In the best case---if
you're really organized---you're just writing it <i>down.</i>
<font color="#aa0000">In a real essay you're writing for yourself.  You're
thinking out loud.<br><br>But not quite.  Just as inviting people over forces you to
clean up your apartment, writing something that</font> you know
<font color="#aa0000">
other people will read forces you to think well.  So it
does matter to have an audience.  The things I've written
just for myself are no good.</font>  Indeed, they're bad in
a particular way:
<font color="#aa0000">they tend to peter out.  When I run into
difficulties, I</font> notice that I
<font color="#aa0000">tend to conclude with a few vague
questions and then drift off to get a cup of tea.</font><br><br>This seems a common problem.
It's practically the standard
ending in blog entries--- with the addition of a "heh" or an 
emoticon, prompted by the all too accurate sense that
something is missing.<br><br>And indeed, a lot of
<font color="#aa0000">published essays peter out in</font> this
<font color="#aa0000">same way.
Particularly the sort written by the staff writers of newsmagazines.  Outside writers tend to supply
editorials of the defend-a-position variety, which
make a beeline toward a rousing (and
foreordained) conclusion.   But the staff writers feel
obliged to write something</font> more
<font color="#aa0000">balanced</font>, which in
practice ends up meaning blurry.
<font color="#aa0000">Since they're
writing for a popular magazine, they start with the
most radioactively controversial questions, from which</font>
(<font color="#aa0000">because they're writing for a popular magazine</font>)
<font color="#aa0000">they then proceed to recoil</font> from
<font color="#aa0000">in terror.</font>
Gay marriage, <font color="#aa0000">for or
against?  This group says one thing.  That group says
another.  One thing is certain: the question is a
complex one.  (But don't get mad at us.  We didn't
draw any conclusions.)<br><br>Questions aren't enough.  An essay has to come up with answers.
They don't always, of course.  Sometimes you start with a  
promising question and get nowhere.  But those you don't
publish.  Those are like experiments that get inconclusive
results.   Something you publish ought to tell the reader  
something he didn't already know.<br><br>
But <i>what</i> you tell him doesn't matter, so long as   
it's interesting.  I'm sometimes accused of meandering.
In defend-a-position writing that would be a flaw.
There you're not concerned with truth.  You already
know where you're going, and you want to go straight there,
blustering through obstacles, and hand-waving
your way across swampy ground.  But that's not what
you're trying to do in an essay.  An essay is supposed to
be a search for truth.  It would be suspicious if it didn't
meander.<br><br>The Meander is a river in</font> Asia Minor (aka
<font color="#aa0000">Turkey</font>).
<font color="#aa0000">As you might expect, it winds all over the place.
But</font> does it
<font color="#aa0000">do this out of frivolity</font>?   Quite the opposite.
Like all rivers, it's rigorously following the laws of physics.
<font color="#aa0000">The path it has discovered</font>,
winding as it is, represents
<font color="#aa0000">the most economical route to the sea.<br><br>The river's algorithm is simple.  At each step, flow down.
For the essayist this translates to: flow interesting.
Of all the places to go next, choose</font>
whichever seems
<font color="#aa0000">most interesting.</font><br><br>I'm pushing this metaphor a bit.  An essayist
<font color="#aa0000">can't have
quite as little foresight as a river.</font>  In fact what you do
(or what I do) is somewhere between a river and a roman
road-builder.  I have a general idea of the direction
I want to go in, and
I choose the next topic with that in mind.  This essay is
about writing, so I do occasionally yank it back in that
direction, but it is not all the sort of essay I
thought I was going to write about writing.<br><br>Note too that hill-climbing (which is what this algorithm is
called) can get you in trouble.
<font color="#aa0000">Sometimes,</font> just
<font color="#aa0000">like a river,</font>
you
<font color="#aa0000">run up against a blank wall.</font>  What
<font color="#aa0000">I do</font> then is just 
<font color="#aa0000">what the river does: backtrack.
At one point in this essay
I found that after following a certain thread I ran out
of ideas.  I had to go back</font> n
<font color="#aa0000">paragraphs and start over
in another direction.</font>  For illustrative purposes I've left
the abandoned branch as a footnote.<br><br><font color="#aa0000">
Err on the side of the river.  An essay is not a reference
work.  It's not something you read looking for a specific
answer, and feel cheated if you don't find it.  I'd much
rather read an essay that went off in an unexpected but
interesting direction than one that plodded dutifully along
a prescribed course.<br><br>So what's interesting?  For me, interesting means surprise.
Design, as </font>Matz
<font color="#aa0000">has said, should follow the principle of
least</font> surprise.
<font color="#aa0000">A button that looks like it will make a
machine stop should make it stop, not speed up.  Essays
should do the opposite.  Essays should aim for maximum
surprise.<br><br>I was afraid of flying for a long time and could only travel
vicariously.  When friends came back from faraway places,
it wasn't just out of politeness that I asked them</font> about
their trip.
<font color="#aa0000">I really wanted to know.  And I found</font> that
<font color="#aa0000">the best way to get information out of them was to ask
what surprised them.  How was the place different from what
they expected?  This is an extremely useful question.
You can ask it of</font> even
<font color="#aa0000">the most unobservant people, and it will
extract information they didn't even know they were
recording. </font><br><br>Indeed, you can ask it in real time.  Now when I go somewhere
new, I make a note of what surprises me about it.  Sometimes I
even make a conscious effort to visualize the place beforehand,
so I'll have a detailed image to diff with reality.<br><br><font color="#aa0000">
Surprises are</font> facts
<font color="#aa0000">you didn't</font> already 
<font color="#aa0000">know</font>.
<font color="#aa0000">But</font> they're
more than that.  They're facts
<font color="#aa0000">that contradict things you
thought you knew.  And so they're the most valuable sort of
fact you can get.  They're like a food that's not merely
healthy, but counteracts the unhealthy effects of things
you've already eaten.<br><br>
How do you find surprises?  Well, therein lies half
the work of essay writing.  (The other half is expressing
yourself well.)</font>   You can at least
<font color="#aa0000">use yourself as a
proxy for the reader.  You should only write about things
you've thought about a lot.  And anything you come across
that surprises you, who've thought about the topic a lot,
will probably surprise most readers.<br><br>For example, in a recent essay I pointed out that because
you can only judge computer programmers by working with
them, no one knows</font> in programming who the heroes should
be.
<font color="#aa0000">I</font>
certainly
<font color="#aa0000">didn't realize this when I</font> started writing
the 
<font color="#aa0000">essay, and even now I find it kind of weird.  That's
what you're looking for.<br><br>So if you want to write essays, you need two ingredients:</font>
you need
<font color="#aa0000">a few topics that you think about a lot, and</font> you
need <font color="#aa0000">some ability to ferret out the unexpected.<br><br>What should you think about?  My guess is that it
doesn't matter</font>.  Almost everything is
<font color="#aa0000">interesting if you get deeply
enough into it.</font>  The <font color="#aa0000">one possible exception</font>
are
<font color="#aa0000">things
like working in fast food,</font> which
<font color="#aa0000">have deliberately had all
the variation sucked out of them</font>.
<font color="#aa0000">In retrospect, was there
anything interesting about working in Baskin-Robbins?
Well, it was interesting</font> to notice
<font color="#aa0000">how important color was
to the customers.  Kids a certain age would point into
the case and say that they wanted yellow.  Did they want
French Vanilla or Lemon?  They would just look at you
blankly.  They wanted yellow.  And then there was the
mystery of why the perennial favorite Pralines n' Cream
was so appealing. I</font>'m inclined now to
<font color="#aa0000">think it was the salt.</font>
And the mystery of why Passion Fruit tasted so disgusting.
People would order it because of the name, and were always
disappointed.  It should have been called In-sink-erator
Fruit.
<font color="#aa0000">And</font> there was
<font color="#aa0000">the difference in the way fathers and
mothers bought ice cream for their kids</font>.
<font color="#aa0000">Fathers</font> tended to
adopt the attitude of
<font color="#aa0000">benevolent kings bestowing largesse,</font>
and <font color="#aa0000">mothers</font> that of
<font color="#aa0000">harried</font> bureaucrats,
<font color="#aa0000">giving in to
pressure</font> against their better judgement.
<font color="#aa0000">So, yes, there does seem to be material, even in
fast food.</font><br><br>What about the other half, ferreting out the unexpected?
That may require some natural ability.  I've noticed for
a long time that I'm pathologically observant.  ....<br><br>[That was as far as I'd gotten at the time.]<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[sh] In Shakespeare's own time, serious writing meant theological
discourses, not the bawdy plays acted over on the other  
side of the river among the bear gardens and whorehouses.<br><br>The other extreme, the work that seems formidable from the moment
it's created (indeed, is deliberately intended to be)
is represented by Milton.  Like the Aeneid, Paradise Lost is a
rock imitating a butterfly that happened to get fossilized.
Even Samuel Johnson seems to have balked at this, on the one  
hand paying Milton the compliment of an extensive biography,
and on the other writing of Paradise Lost that "none who read it
ever wished it longer."<br><br><br><br><!-- <hr>
<font color=#000000>That was as far as I'd gotten at the time.
The rest is a kind of midden that always accumulates at the
end of the file, consisting of notes to myself
and chunks of deleted text that I might (but never do) re-use later.<br /><br /><br /><br />These are the notes about what to work on the next morning.
(The percent sign is the LaTex comment character.)
Except for the beginning, I didn't write about what I expected to:</font>
<pre>
% I didn't consciously notice the BR stuff at the time.
% I'm noticing it now from raw memories.
% naturalistic and weird: breugel
% not allowed to write about painting
% like nothing more than to be wrong-- because surprise

%  that violate the usual social conventions, much as surgeons

%  opinions.  I love to be surprised, and to be surprised is
%  always to have been at least implicitly mistaken   
</pre><br /><br /><font color=#000000>
This is the part I had to discard when I backtracked.
It used to follow the paragraph that ended with
"prescribed course."</font><br /><br />Because you're after answers, instead of just trying to
convince people of something, it's important to qualify
your conclusions precisely.  No scientist will be satisfied
to hear that you measured something and it was 12.7.
12.7 plus or minus what?  What's your experimental error?<br /><br />This is just as important for questions whose answers
aren't numbers.
And yet people rarely bother in ordinary
conversation, most scientists included.  Once people
switch over to talking about matters that aren't
"scientific"--- mere matters of opinion--- they pay
comparatively little attention to qualifying what they say.<br /><br />Oh, they <i>use</i> qualifiers.  Once kids
arrive in college they learn pretty quickly that proper
intellectuals qualify every statement with "perhaps"
or "almost."  But this kind of qualification is nothing more
than grammatical. Sometimes these automatically inserted
qualifications end up at odds with the statements they're
attached to, yielding comic results.
You find people saying that a certain writer is
"perhaps the greatest writer of the twentieth century."
That's a rather strong way to put something you're not sure
about.  Wouldn't it be better just to say "one of the best
writers of the twentieth century?"<br /><br />One of the only people I've ever met who really pays attention
to qualification is my friend Robert Morris.  His great
fear in life is to say something that's mistaken.  So whenever   
he says something, he pays as much attention to expressing
how sure he is of it as he does to what he's saying.  He
is a connoisseur of his own certainty, and has as many words
for expressing it as Eskimos have for snow.  This is how we
all ought to be.  Sticking a perfunctory perhaps onto
every statement may shield us from blame, but it tells the
reader nothing.  That's like the manufacturers of Q-Tips,
who to cover themselves print "do not insert in ear canal" on the
boxes, when they know damned well that that's how Q-Tips are used.<br /><br />One of the most important things to know about
painting is that darks make the light.  This is particularly
obvious in watercolor.  Suppose you want to make a painting
that seems glowing with light.  Well, you can't get any
brighter than the white of the paper.  So the only way to
make the make the painting bright is to add darks
that make the lights seem brighter by contrast.  Without
darks, the painting won't seem bright; it will just seem
washed out.<br /><br />Some books about writing say that you shouldn't begin
sentences with "I think."  If you're saying something,
the argument does, then obviously you think it, so why
bother telling people?  This is nonsense.  The heavily qualified
statements in an essay play the role of darks.  When you
reach a point you're really sure of, you can just state it with no
qualifications, and it will have all the more force by contrast.<br /><br />People aren't used to
unqualified statements.  Without the automatic "perhaps"
they're used to seeing, many realize, with a shock,   
that what they're reading are <i>opinions.</i>
Well of course.  And what essay consists of anything else?
An essay is not a theorem.
You don't have to say only things you can prove irrefutably.
Don't be afraid of expressing your opinions.  Just make sure
you're right.<br /><br /><br /><br /><font color=#000000>
Miscellaneous smaller cuts:</font><br /><br />The downside is that essays may contain mistakes (though
so can theorems).  The upside is that you can talk about<br /><br />more things.<br /><br />The world is not divided into the "scientific" and the
"subjective."  Scientific is a matter of degree.  And there
are plenty of questions that would be impractical to
answer by a controlled experiment and yet which are
worth discussing.  Indeed, some of the most interesting
questions are of this type.<br /><br />To mathematicians, the work of physicists seems rather
speculative.<br /><br />But if they're less precise, they can talk about a broader
range of subjects.<br /><br />Sometimes I feel tempted to
add a disclaimer to the beginning of my essays saying,
if you're bothered by unqualified statements, just stick  
the "perhaps" that you're used to seeing before each one.
I mean the same thing.<br /><br />Don't expect people to thank you for delivering these  
valuable facts to them, though---any more than they would
thank you for giving them steamed vegetables for dinner.<br /><br /><br /><br /><font color=#000000>
More notes about topics I intended to cover:</font>
<pre>
% people will get angry, accuse you of making unsupported statements
% mere opinions
%  as if problem was structure, not content
% whole question of qualification, support
% all the good writers seem to be english
% practically the algorithm for life: look for anomalies
% actually start the one about the role of color in fashion 
% try to write sound bites
% length kind of arbitrary, based on human reader,
%  not needs of topic
</pre><font color=#000000><br /><br />And more cut text:</font><br /><br />I don't know O'Reilly's street address,
but it's probably not going to surprise me.  Surprises are<br /><br />What's so important about surprises?  They're the truth
you didn't already know.<br /><br />An essay must at least explore conclusions, even if
this offends people.  And the disconcerting thing is,
merely exploring ideas does offend people.
Readers used to defend-a-position
writing tend to get as angry with you for saying
"let's explore the possibility that x" as if you had
said "I believe x."  Indeed, some writers use the former
as nothing more than a learned sounding replacement for
the latter.  But in a proper essay,<br /><br />But when I want to say x I just say it.<br /><br />That sort of thing isn't really an essay either, though
it begins like one.<br /><br />I'm too afraid of real live readers to pull that sort of
thing.<br /><br />fuzzy treatments of controversial topics
that begin with interesting questions, retreat in terror
from the<br /><br />nature of newsmagazines means that such essays always start
with the most controversial questions.<br /><br />Real live readers won't stand for this.   In fact, they're
often made to stand for it.  I've noticed plenty of "essays"
that peter out in this way.<br /><br />Their resistance
gives the essay half its shape.<br /><br />Writing well is an extremely valuable skill.  In part
because to do it you have to think well.<br /><br />By the late 19th century, the era in which the study of ancient
texts had been the hottest area of scholarship was a
distant memory.  But the classics still had enormous prestige.
The problems posed by the ancientness part had been mostly
solved, or solved as well as they were going to be.  And so
what was left<br /><br />the people doing it hardly
remembered why it had originally been done.<br /><br />We think of the classics as tidy little red and green volumes
from the Loeb Library.<br /><br />From Islamic civilizations,
which were at that time far ahead in matters of scholarship,
they got Plato, Aristotle, Euclid, Ptolemy.
different Europe: what entered in 500 was the rump of the
western Roman empire, and what emerged in 1000 was a

Italy.<br /><br />misleading to talk about "Europe"<br /><br />From this
period date the oldest surviving institutions<br /><br />because university admissions were
limited to children whose parents were willing to pay for them
to spend ten years studying ancient languages.<br /><br />(I'm not saying that new disciplines have no content.
I'm just saying that that isn't necessary.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><font color=#000000>
These appear to the the original notes I started with.

strikes me as on the mark.)</i>
-->
A lot of people are writing now about 
why Kerry lost.  Here I want to
examine a more specific question: why were the exit polls so 
wrong?<br><br>In Ohio, which Kerry ultimately
lost 49-51, exit polls gave him a 52-48 victory.  And this wasn't just
random error.  In every swing state they overestimated the Kerry vote.
In Florida, which Bush ultimately won 52-47, exit polls predicted
a dead heat.<br><br>(These are not early numbers. They're from about midnight eastern time, 
long after polls closed in Ohio and Florida.  And yet by the
next afternoon the exit poll numbers online corresponded to the returns.  
The only way I can imagine this happening is if those in
charge of the exit polls cooked the books after seeing the actual
returns.  But that's another issue.)<br><br>What happened?  The source of the problem may be a variant of
the Bradley Effect.  
This term
was invented after Tom Bradley, the black mayor of Los Angeles, 
lost an election for governor of California despite a comfortable
lead in the polls.  Apparently voters were afraid to say  
they planned to vote against him, lest their motives be
(perhaps correctly) suspected.<br><br>It seems likely that something similar happened in exit polls this year.
In theory, exit polls ought to be very accurate.  
You're not asking people what they would do.  You're
asking what they just did.<br><br>How can you get errors asking that?  Because some people don't
respond.  To get a truly random sample, pollsters ask, say, every
20th person leaving the polling place who they voted for.  But not
everyone wants to answer.  And the pollsters can't simply ignore
those who won't, or their sample isn't random anymore.  So what
they do, apparently, is note down the age and race and sex of the
person, and guess from that who they voted for.<br><br>This works so long as there is no <i>correlation</i> between who people
vote for and whether they're willing to talk about it.  But this
year there may have been.  It may be that a significant number of 
those who voted for
Bush didn't want to say so.<br><br>Why not?  Because people in the US are more conservative than they're
willing to admit.  The values of the elite in this country, at least
at the moment, are NPR values.  The average person, as I think both
Republicans and Democrats would agree, is more socially conservative.  
But while some openly flaunt the fact that they don't share the
opinions of the elite, others feel a little nervous about it, as 
if they had bad table manners.<br><br>For example, according to current NPR values, you 
<a href="say.html">can't say</a> anything that might be 
perceived as disparaging towards homosexuals.  To do  
so is "homophobic."  And yet a large number of Americans are deeply
religious, and the Bible is quite explicit on the subject of
homosexuality.  What are they to do?  I think what many do is keep 
their opinions, but keep them to themselves.<br><br>They know what they believe, but they also know what they're supposed
to believe.
And so when a stranger (for example, a pollster) asks
them their opinion about something like gay marriage, they will not
always say what they really think.<br><br>When the values of the elite are liberal, polls will tend to
underestimate the conservativeness of ordinary voters.  This seems
to me the leading theory to explain why the exit polls were so 
far off this year.  NPR values   
said one ought to vote for Kerry.  So all the people who voted for
Kerry felt virtuous for doing so, and were eager to tell pollsters
they had. No one who voted for Kerry did it as an act of quiet
defiance.<br><br><!-- Imagine this scenario.  A husband and wife go to vote.  The wife
thinks Bush has made a mess in Iraq and that the family is worse   
off economically than a few years ago, and plans to vote for Kerry.
The husband thinks it's
great that America is finally kicking some ass, and sees in George

the 1968 election.)</i>
-->
November 2004, corrected June 2006<br><br>Occam's razor says we should prefer the simpler of two explanations.
I begin by reminding readers of this principle because I'm about
to propose a theory that will offend both liberals and conservatives.
But Occam's razor means, in effect, that if you want to disagree
with it, you have a hell of a coincidence to explain.<br><br>Theory: In US presidential elections, the more 
charismatic candidate wins.<br><br>People who write about politics, whether on the left or the right,
have a consistent bias: they take politics seriously.  When one
candidate beats another they look for political explanations.  The
country is shifting to the left, or the right.  And that sort of
shift can certainly be the result of a presidential election, which
makes it easy to believe it was the cause.<br><br>But when I think about why I voted for Clinton over the first George
Bush, it wasn't because I was shifting to the left.  Clinton just
seemed more dynamic.  He seemed to want the job more.  Bush seemed
old and tired.  I suspect it was the same for a lot of voters.<br><br>Clinton didn't represent any national shift leftward.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font>
He was
just more charismatic than George Bush or (God help us) Bob Dole.
In 2000 we practically got a controlled experiment to prove it:
Gore had Clinton's policies, but not his charisma, and he suffered
proportionally. 
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>
Same story in 2004. Kerry was smarter and more
articulate than Bush, but rather a stiff.  And Kerry lost.<br><br>As I looked further back, I kept finding the same pattern.  
Pundits said Carter beat Ford
because the country distrusted the Republicans after Watergate.
And yet it also happened that Carter was famous for his big grin
and folksy ways, and Ford for being a boring klutz.  Four years
later, pundits said the country had lurched to the right.  But
Reagan, a former actor, also happened to be even more charismatic
than Carter (whose grin was somewhat less cheery after four stressful
years in office).  In 1984 the charisma gap between Reagan and
Mondale was like that between Clinton and Dole, with similar results.
The first George Bush managed to win in 1988, though he would later
be vanquished by one of the most charismatic presidents ever, because
in 1988 he was up against the notoriously uncharismatic
Michael Dukakis.<br><br>These are the elections I remember personally, but apparently the
same pattern played out in 1964 and 1972.  The most recent
counterexample appears to be 1968, when Nixon beat the more charismatic Hubert
Humphrey.  But when you examine that election, it tends to support
the charisma theory more than contradict it.  As Joe McGinnis
recounts in his famous book <i>The Selling of the President 1968</i>,
Nixon knew he had less charisma than Humphrey, and thus simply
refused to debate him on TV.  He knew he couldn't afford to let the
two of them be seen side by side.<br><br>Now a candidate probably couldn't get away with refusing to debate.
But in 1968 the custom of televised debates was still evolving.  In
effect, Nixon won in 1968 because voters were never allowed to see
the real Nixon.  All they saw were carefully scripted campaign
spots.<br><br>Oddly enough, the most recent true counterexample is probably 1960.
Though this election is usually given as an example of the power
of TV, Kennedy apparently would not have won without fraud by party
machines in Illinois and Texas.  But TV was still young in 1960;
only 87% of households had it.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
Undoubtedly TV helped Kennedy,
so historians are correct in regarding this election as a
watershed.  TV required a new kind of candidate. There would be no
more Calvin Coolidges.<br><br>The charisma theory may also explain why Democrats tend to lose
presidential elections.  The core of the Democrats' ideology seems
to be a belief in government.  Perhaps this tends to attract people
who are earnest, but dull.  Dukakis, Gore, and Kerry were so similar
in that respect that they might have been brothers.  Good thing for
the Democrats that their screen lets through an occasional Clinton,
even if some scandal results.  
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>One would like to believe elections are won and lost on issues, if
only fake ones like Willie Horton.  And yet, if they are, we have
a remarkable coincidence to explain.  In every presidential election
since TV became widespread, the apparently more charismatic candidate
has won.  Surprising, isn't it, that voters' opinions on the issues
have lined up with charisma for 11 elections in a row?<br><br>The political commentators who come up with shifts to the left or
right in their morning-after analyses are like the financial reporters
stuck writing stories day after day about the random fluctuations
of the stock market.  Day ends, market closes up or down, reporter
looks for good or bad news respectively, and writes that the market
was up on news of Intel's earnings, or down on fears of instability
in the Middle East.  Suppose we could somehow feed these reporters
false information about market closes, but give them all the other
news intact.  Does anyone believe they would notice the anomaly,
and not simply write that stocks were up (or down) on whatever good
(or bad) news there was that day?  That they would say, hey, wait
a minute, how can stocks be up with all this unrest in the Middle
East?<br><br>I'm not saying that issues don't matter to voters.  Of course they
do.  But the major parties know so well which issues matter how
much to how many voters, and adjust their message so precisely in
response, that they tend to split the difference on the issues,
leaving the election to be decided by the one factor they can't
control: charisma.<br><br>If the Democrats had been running a candidate as charismatic as
Clinton in the 2004 election, he'd have won.  And we'd be reading
that the election was a referendum on the war in Iraq, instead of
that the Democrats are out of touch with evangelical Christians in
middle America.<br><br>During the 1992 election, the Clinton campaign staff had a big sign
in their office saying "It's the economy, stupid." Perhaps it was
even simpler than they thought.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Postscript</b><br><br>Opinions seem to be divided about the charisma theory.  Some say
it's impossible, others say it's obvious.  This seems a good sign.
Perhaps it's in the sweet spot midway between.<br><br>As for it being impossible, I reply: here's the data; here's the
theory; theory explains data 100%.   To a scientist, at least, that
means it deserves attention, however implausible it seems.<br><br>You can't believe voters are so superficial that they just choose
the most charismatic guy?  My theory doesn't require that.  I'm not
proposing that charisma is the only factor, just that it's the only
one <i>left</i> after the efforts of the two parties cancel one
another out.<br><br>As for the theory being obvious, as far as I know, no one has
proposed it before.  Election forecasters are proud when they can
achieve the same results with much more complicated models.<br><br>Finally, to the people who say that the theory is probably true,
but rather depressing: it's not so bad as it seems.  The phenomenon
is like a pricing anomaly; once people realize it's there, it will
disappear.  Once both parties realize it's a waste of time to
nominate uncharismatic candidates, they'll tend to nominate only
the most charismatic ones.  And if the candidates are equally
charismatic, charisma will cancel out, and elections will be decided
on issues, as political commentators like to think they are now.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
As Clinton himself discovered to his surprise when, in one of
his first acts as president, he tried to shift the military leftward.
After a bruising fight he escaped with a face-saving compromise.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
True, Gore won the popular vote. But politicians know the electoral
vote decides the election, so that's what they campaign for. If Bush
had been campaigning for the popular vote he would presumably have
got more of it. (Thanks to judgmentalist for this point.)<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Source: Nielsen Media Research.  Of the remaining 13%, 11 didn't
have TV because they couldn't afford it.  I'd argue that the missing
11% were probably also the 11% most susceptible to charisma.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
One implication of this theory is that parties shouldn't be too
quick to reject candidates with skeletons in their closets.
Charismatic candidates will tend to have more skeletons than squeaky
clean dullards, but in practice that doesn't seem to lose elections.
The current Bush, for example, probably did more drugs in his
twenties than any preceding president, and yet managed to get elected
with a base of evangelical Christians.  All you have to do is say
you've reformed, and stonewall about the details.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Maria Daniels, Jessica Livingston,
Jackie McDonough, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this, and
to Eric Raymond for pointing out that I was wrong about 1968.<br><br>

looking astonished.  "It's so <i>ugly!"</i><br><br>People from other rich countries can scarcely imagine
the squalor of the man-made bits of America.  In travel books
they show you mostly natural environments: the Grand Canyon,
whitewater rafting, horses in a field.  If you see
pictures with man-made things in them, it will be either a
view of the New York skyline shot from a discreet distance,
or a carefully cropped image of a seacoast town in Maine.<br><br>How can it be, visitors must wonder.  How can the richest country
in the world look like this?<br><br>Oddly enough, it may not be a coincidence.  Americans are good
at some things and bad at others.  We're good at making
movies and software, and bad at making cars and cities.
And I think we may be good at what we're good at for the same
reason we're bad at what we're bad at.  We're impatient.
In America, if you want to do something, you don't worry that
it might come out badly, or upset delicate social balances, or
that people might think you're getting above yourself.  If you
want to do something, as Nike says, <i>just do it.</i><br><br><br><br>This works well in some fields and badly in others.  I suspect
it works in movies and software because they're both messy  
processes.  "Systematic"
is the last word I'd use to describe the way 
<a href="gh.html">good programmers</a> write software.
Code is not something they assemble painstakingly after
careful planning, like the pyramids.  It's something they
plunge into, working fast and constantly changing their minds,
like a charcoal sketch.<br><br>In software, paradoxical
as it sounds, good craftsmanship means working fast.
If you work slowly and meticulously,
you merely end up with a very fine implementation of your initial,
mistaken idea.
Working slowly and meticulously is
premature optimization.  Better to get a
prototype done fast, and see what new ideas
it gives you.<br><br>It sounds like making movies works a lot like making software.
Every movie is a Frankenstein, full of imperfections
and usually quite different from what was originally envisioned.  
But interesting, and finished fairly quickly.  <!--If you tried to
make movies perfect, they'd never be done.--><br><br>I think we get away with this in movies and software
because they're both malleable mediums.  Boldness pays.
<!-- Nothing is
set in stone.  You can get away
with last minute changes.-->
And if at the last minute two parts don't quite   
fit, you can figure out some hack that will at least conceal
the problem.<br><br>Not so with cars, or cities.  They are all too physical.
If the car business worked like software or movies, you'd
surpass your competitors by making a car that weighed only
fifty pounds, or folded up to the size of a motorcycle when   
you wanted to park it.  But with physical products there are
more constraints.  You don't win by dramatic innovations
so much as by good taste and attention to detail.<br><br>The trouble is, the very word "taste"
sounds slightly ridiculous to American ears.
It seems pretentious, or frivolous, or even effeminate.
Blue staters think it's "subjective," and red staters 
think it's for sissies.  So anyone in America
who really cares about design will be sailing upwind.<br><br><br><br>Twenty years ago we used to hear that the problem with
the US car industry was the workers.
We don't hear that any more now that Japanese companies
are building cars in the US.   The problem with
American cars is bad design.  You can see that just by
looking at them.<br><br>All that extra sheet metal on the <a href="matador.html">AMC Matador</a> wasn't
added by the workers.  The problem
with this car, as with American cars today, is that it was
designed by marketing people instead of designers.<br><br>Why do the Japanese make better cars than us?  Some say it's
because their culture encourages cooperation.  That may come
into it.   But in this case it seems more to the point that
their culture prizes design and craftsmanship.<br><br>For centuries the Japanese have made finer things than we
have in the West.  When you look at swords they
made in 1200, you just can't believe the date on the label
is right.
Presumably their cars fit together more   
precisely than ours for the same reason their joinery always has.
They're obsessed with making things well.<br><br>Not us.
When we make something in America, our aim is just to get the   
job done.  Once we reach that point, we take one of two routes.
We can stop there, and have something crude but
serviceable, like a Vise-grip.  Or we can improve it,
which usually means encrusting it with gratuitous ornament.
When we want to make a car "better,"
we stick <a href="59eldorado.html">tail fins</a> on it, or make it 
<a href="75eldorado.html">longer</a>, or make the  
<a href="04magnum.html">windows smaller</a>, depending on the current fashion.<br><br>Ditto for houses.  In America you can have either a flimsy box banged
together out of two by fours and drywall, or a McMansion-- a
flimsy box banged together out of two by fours and drywall,
but larger, more dramatic-looking, and full of expensive fittings.
Rich people don't get better design or craftsmanship;
they just get a larger, more conspicuous version of the
standard house.<br><br>We don't especially prize design or craftsmanship here.  What
we like is speed, and we're willing to do something in an ugly
way to get it done fast.  In some
fields, like software or movies, this is a net win.  
<!-- But in
others, like cars or consumer electronics, it isn't.  --><br><br>But it's not just that software and movies are malleable mediums.
In those businesses, the designers (though they're
not generally called that) have more power.   
Software companies, at least successful ones, tend to be run
by programmers.  And in the film industry, though producers
may second-guess directors, the director controls most of
what appears on the screen.
And so American software and movies, and Japanese cars, all
have this in common: the people in charge care about
design-- the former because the designers are in charge, and the latter
because the whole culture cares about design.<br><br>I think most Japanese executives would be horrified at
the idea of making a bad car.  Whereas American executives,
in their hearts, still believe the most important thing about
a car is the image it projects.
Make a good car?  What's "good?"  It's so <i>subjective.</i>
If you want to know how to design a car, ask a focus group.<br><br>Instead of relying on their own internal design compass
(like Henry Ford did),
American car companies try to make what marketing people
think consumers want.  But it isn't working.  American cars continue
to lose market share.  And the reason is that the customer
doesn't want what he thinks he wants.<br><br>Letting focus groups design your cars for you  
only wins in the short term.  In the long term, it pays
to bet on good design.  The focus group may say they want the
meretricious feature du jour, but what they want even more is
to imitate sophisticated buyers, and they, though a
small minority, really do care about good design.
Eventually the
pimps and drug dealers notice that the doctors and lawyers
have switched from Cadillac to Lexus, and do the same.<br><br>Apple is an interesting counterexample to the general
American trend.  If you want to buy a nice CD player, you'll
probably buy a Japanese one.  But if you want to buy an
MP3 player, you'll probably buy an iPod.  What happened?
Why doesn't Sony dominate MP3 players?  Because Apple is
in the consumer electronics business now, and unlike
other American companies, they're obsessed with good design.  
Or more precisely, their CEO is.<br><br>I just got an iPod, and it's not just nice.  It's     
<i>surprisingly</i> nice.  For it to surprise me, it must be
satisfying expectations I didn't know I had.  No focus
group is going to discover those.  Only a great   
designer can.<br><br><br><br>Cars aren't the worst thing we make in America.
Where the just-do-it model fails most dramatically is in our cities-- or
rather, <a href="denver.html">exurbs</a>.
If real estate developers operated on a large enough scale, if
they built whole towns, market forces would compel
them to build towns that didn't suck.  But they only build a
couple office buildings or suburban streets at a time, and the
result is so depressing that the inhabitants consider it a great
treat to fly to Europe and spend a couple weeks living what
is, for people there, just everyday life. [1]<br><br>But the just-do-it model does have advantages.  It seems the clear
winner for generating wealth and technical innovations
(which are practically the same thing).  I think speed is the reason.
It's hard to create wealth by making a commodity.  The
real value is in things that are new, and if you want to
be the first to make something, it helps to work fast.
For better or worse, the just-do-it model is fast,
whether you're Dan Bricklin writing the prototype of VisiCalc in
a weekend, or a real estate developer
building a block of shoddy condos in a month.<br><br>If I had to choose between the just-do-it model and the
careful model, I'd probably choose just-do-it.
But do we have to choose?  Could we have it both ways?
Could Americans have nice
places to live without undermining the impatient, individualistic spirit
that makes us good at software?  Could other countries
introduce more individualism into their technology companies
and research labs without having it metastasize as strip malls?
I'm optimistic.  It's harder to
say about other countries, but in the US, at least, I think 
we can have both.<br><br>Apple is an encouraging example.  They've managed to preserve
enough of the impatient, hackerly spirit you need to write
software.  And yet when
you pick up a new Apple laptop, well, it doesn't
seem American.  It's too perfect.  It seems as if it
must have been made by a Swedish or a Japanese company.<br><br>In many technologies, version 2 has higher resolution.  Why
not in design generally?  I think we'll gradually see
national characters superseded
by occupational characters: hackers in Japan will be allowed
to behave with a <a href="gba.html">willfulness</a> 
that would now seem unJapanese,
and products in America will be designed with an
insistence on <a href="taste.html">taste</a> that would now seem unAmerican.
Perhaps the most successful countries, in the future, will be
those most willing to ignore what are now considered
national characters, and do each kind of work in the way
that works best.  Race you.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] Japanese cities are ugly too, but for different reasons.
Japan is prone to earthquakes, so buildings are traditionally
seen as temporary; there is no grand tradition of  city planning
like the one Europeans inherited from Rome.  The other cause is
the notoriously corrupt relationship between the government
and construction companies.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Barry Eisler, Sarah Harlin,

high school.  I never actually 
gave it, because the school authorities vetoed the plan to invite me.)</i><br><br>When I said I was speaking at a high school, my friends were curious.
What will you say to high school students?  So I asked them, what
do you wish someone had told you in high school?  Their answers
were remarkably similar.  So I'm going to tell you what we all wish
someone had told us.<br><br>I'll start by telling you something you don't have to know in high
school: what you want to do with your life.  People are always
asking you this, so you think you're supposed to have an answer.
But adults ask this mainly as a conversation starter.   They want
to know what sort of person you are, and this question is just to
get you talking.  They ask it the way you might poke a hermit crab
in a tide pool, to see what it does.<br><br>If I were back in high school and someone asked about my plans, I'd
say that my first priority was to learn what the options were.  You
don't need to be in a rush to choose your life's work.  What you   
need to do is discover what you like.  You have to work on stuff  
you like if you want to be good at what you do.<br><br>It might seem that nothing would be easier than deciding what you
like, but it turns out to be hard, partly because it's hard to get
an accurate picture of most jobs.  Being a doctor is not the way
it's portrayed on TV.  Fortunately you can also watch real doctors,
by volunteering in hospitals. [1]<br><br>But there are other jobs you can't learn about, because no one is
doing them yet.  Most of the work I've done in the last ten years
didn't exist when I was in high school.  The world changes fast,  
and the rate at which it changes is itself speeding up.  In such a
world it's not a good idea to have fixed plans.<br><br>And yet every May, speakers all over the country fire up the Standard 
Graduation Speech, the theme of which is: don't give up on your
dreams.  I know what they mean, but this is a bad way to put it,
because it implies you're supposed to be bound by some plan you
made early on.  The computer world has a name for this: premature
optimization.  And it is synonymous with disaster.  These speakers
would do better to say simply, don't give up.<br><br>What they really mean is, don't get demoralized.  Don't think that   
you can't do what other people can.   And I agree you shouldn't  
underestimate your potential.  People who've done great things tend
to seem as if they were a race apart.  And most biographies only   
exaggerate this illusion, partly due to the worshipful attitude   
biographers inevitably sink into, and partly because, knowing how
the story ends, they can't help streamlining the plot till it seems
like the subject's life was a matter of destiny, the mere unfolding
of some innate genius.   In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen
year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they'd seem
impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.<br><br>Which is an uncomfortable thought.  If they were just like us, then
they had to work very hard to do what they did.  And that's one  
reason we like to believe in genius.  It gives us an excuse for
being lazy.  If these guys were able to do what they did only because
of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it's not our
fault if we can't do something as good.<br><br>I'm not saying there's no such thing as genius.  But if you're
trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse 
for being lazy, the other one is probably right.<br><br>So far we've cut the Standard Graduation Speech down from "don't
give up on your dreams" to "what someone else can do, you can do."
But it needs to be cut still further.  There is <i>some</i> variation
in natural ability.  Most people overestimate its role, but it does  
exist.  If I were talking to a guy four feet tall whose ambition 
was to play in the NBA, I'd feel pretty stupid saying, you can
do anything if you really try. [2]<br><br>We need to cut the Standard Graduation Speech down to, "what someone
else with your abilities can do, you can do; and don't underestimate
your abilities."  But as so often happens, the closer you get to
the truth, the messier your sentence gets.  We've taken a nice, 
neat (but wrong) slogan, and churned it up like a mud puddle.  It
doesn't make a very good speech anymore.  But worse still, it doesn't
tell you what to do anymore.  Someone with your abilities?  What  
are your abilities?<br><br><b>Upwind</b><br><br>I think the solution is to work in the other direction.  Instead
of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations.
This is what most successful people actually do anyway.<br><br>In the graduation-speech approach, you decide where you want to be
in twenty years, and then ask: what should I do now to get there?  
I propose instead that you don't commit to anything in the future,
but just look at the options available now, and choose those that
will give you the most promising range of options afterward.<br><br>It's not so important what you work on, so long as you're not wasting
your time.  Work on things that interest you and increase your
options, and worry later about which you'll take.<br><br>Suppose you're a college freshman deciding whether to major in math   
or economics.  Well, math will give you more options: you can go into
almost any field from math.  If you major in math it will be easy
to get into grad school in economics, but if you major in economics
it will be hard to get into grad school in math.<br><br>Flying a glider is a good metaphor here.  Because a glider doesn't
have an engine, you can't fly into the wind without losing a lot
of altitude.  If you let yourself get far downwind of good places    
to land, your options narrow uncomfortably.  As a rule you want to
stay upwind.  So I propose that as a replacement for "don't give   
up on your dreams."  Stay upwind.<br><br>How do you do that, though?  Even if math is upwind of economics,
how are you supposed to know that as a high school student?<br><br>Well, you don't, and that's what you need to find out.  <!-- I can give
you some tips on how to recognize upwind. --> Look for smart people
and hard problems.  Smart people tend to clump together, and if you
can find such a clump, it's probably worthwhile to join it.  But
it's not straightforward to find these, because there is a lot of  
faking going on.<br><br>To a newly arrived undergraduate, all university departments look
much the same.  The professors all seem forbiddingly intellectual
and publish papers unintelligible to outsiders.  But while in some
fields the papers are unintelligible because they're full of hard
ideas, in others they're deliberately written in an obscure way to
seem as if they're saying something important.  This may seem a   
scandalous proposition, but it has been experimentally verified,
in the famous <i>Social Text</i> affair.  Suspecting that the papers
published by literary theorists were often just intellectual-sounding
nonsense, a physicist deliberately wrote a paper full of
intellectual-sounding nonsense, and submitted it to a literary
theory journal, which published it.<br><br>The best protection is always to be working on hard problems.   
Writing novels is hard.  Reading novels isn't. 
Hard means worry: if you're not worrying that
something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be 
able to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard
enough.  There has to be suspense.<br><br>Well, this seems a grim view of the world, you may think.  What I'm
telling you is that you should worry?  Yes, but it's not as bad as
it sounds.  It's exhilarating to overcome worries.  You don't see
faces much happier than people winning gold medals.  And you know
why they're so happy?  Relief.<br><br>I'm not saying this is the only way to be happy.  Just that some
kinds of worry are not as bad as they sound.<br><br><b>Ambition</b><br><br>In practice, "stay upwind" reduces to "work on hard problems."  And  
you can start today.  I wish I'd grasped that in
high school.<br><br>Most people like to be good at what they do.  In the so-called real  
world this need is a powerful force.  But high school students
rarely benefit from it, because they're given a fake thing to do.  
When I was in high school, I let myself believe that my job was to 
be a high school student.  And so I let my need to be good at what 
I did be satisfied by merely doing well in school.<br><br>If you'd asked me in high school what the difference was between
high school kids and adults, I'd have said it was that adults had 
to earn a living.  Wrong.  It's that adults take responsibility for
themselves.  Making a living is only a small part of it.
Far more important is to take intellectual responsibility for oneself.<br><br>If I had to go through high school again, I'd treat it like a day
job.  I don't mean that I'd slack in school.  Working at something
as a day job doesn't mean doing it badly.  It means not being defined
by it.  I mean I wouldn't think of myself as a high school student,
just as a musician with a day job as a waiter doesn't think of   
himself as a waiter. [3]   And when I wasn't working at my day job
I'd start trying to do real work.<br><br>When I ask people what they regret most about high school, they
nearly all say the same thing: that they wasted so much time.  If
you're wondering what you're doing now that you'll regret most
later, that's probably it. [4]<br><br>Some people say this is inevitable — that high school students
aren't capable of getting anything done yet.  But I don't think
this is true.  And the proof is that you're bored.  You probably
weren't bored when you were eight.  When you're eight it's called
"playing" instead of "hanging out," but it's the same thing.  And
when I was eight, I was rarely bored.  Give me a back yard and a
few other kids and I could play all day.<br><br>The reason this got stale in middle school and high school, I now
realize, is that I was ready for something else.  Childhood was
getting old.<br><br>I'm not saying you shouldn't hang out with your friends — that you
should all become humorless little robots who do nothing but work.
Hanging out with friends is like chocolate cake.  You enjoy it more
if you eat it occasionally than if you eat nothing but chocolate  
cake for every meal.  No matter how much you like chocolate cake,
you'll be pretty queasy after the third meal of it.  And that's  
what the malaise one feels in high school is: mental queasiness.
[5]<br><br>You may be thinking, we have to do more than get good grades.  We
have to have <i>extracurricular activities.</i>  But you know
perfectly well how bogus most of these are.  Collecting donations
for a charity is an admirable thing to do, but it's not <i>hard.</i>
It's not getting something done.  What I mean by getting something
done is learning how to write well, or how to program computers,
or what life was really like in preindustrial societies, or how to   
draw the human face from life.  This sort of thing rarely translates
into a line item on a college application.<br><br><b>Corruption</b><br><br>It's dangerous to design your life around getting into college,  
because the people you have to impress to get into college are not 
a very discerning audience.  At most colleges, it's not the professors
who decide whether you get in, but admissions officers, and they
are nowhere near as smart.  They're the NCOs of the intellectual
world. They can't tell how smart you are.
The mere existence of prep schools is proof of that.<br><br>Few parents
would pay so much for their kids to go to a school that didn't 
improve their admissions prospects.  Prep schools openly say this
is one of their aims.  But what that means, if you stop to 
think about it, is that they can
hack the admissions process: that they can take the very same kid
and make him seem a more appealing candidate than he would if he  
went to the local public school. [6]<br><br>Right now most of you feel your job in life is to be a promising
college applicant.  But that means you're designing your life to
satisfy a process so mindless that there's a whole industry devoted
to subverting it.  No wonder you become cynical.  The malaise you
feel is the same that a producer of reality TV shows or a tobacco 
industry executive feels.  And you don't even get paid a lot.<br><br>So what do you do?  What you should not do is rebel.  That's what
I did, and it was a mistake.  I didn't realize exactly what was   
happening to us, but I smelled a major rat.  And so I just gave up.
Obviously the world sucked, so why bother?<br><br>When I discovered that one of our teachers was herself using Cliff's
Notes, it seemed par for the course.  Surely it meant nothing to
get a good grade in such a class.<br><br>In retrospect this was stupid.  It was like someone getting fouled
in a soccer game and saying, hey, you fouled me, that's against the
rules, and walking off the field in indignation.  Fouls happen. 
The thing to do when you get fouled is not to lose your cool.  Just
keep playing.  <!-- Don't even foul the guy back; if you really want  
revenge, you'll make him more unhappy by winning the game than by
elbowing him in the jaw. --><br><br>By putting you in this situation, society has fouled you.   Yes, 
as you suspect, a lot of the stuff you learn in your classes is   
crap.  And yes, as you suspect, the college admissions process is
largely a charade.  But like many fouls, this one was unintentional.
[7] So just keep playing.<br><br>Rebellion is almost as stupid as obedience.  In either case you let
yourself be defined by what they tell you to do.  The best plan, I
think, is to step onto an orthogonal vector.  Don't just do what 
they tell you, and don't just refuse to.  Instead treat school as
a day job.  As day jobs go, it's pretty sweet.  You're done at 3
o'clock, and you can even work on your own stuff while you're there.<br><br><b>Curiosity</b><br><br>And what's your real job supposed to be?  Unless you're Mozart,   
your first task is to figure that out.  What are the great things
to work on?  Where are the imaginative people?  And most importantly,
what are you interested in?  The word "aptitude" is misleading,
because it implies something innate.  The most powerful sort of
aptitude is a consuming interest in some question, and such interests
are often acquired tastes.<br><br>A distorted version of this idea has filtered into popular culture
under the name "passion."  I recently saw an ad for waiters saying
they wanted people with a "passion for service."  The real thing 
is not something one could have for waiting on tables.  And passion
is a bad word for it. A better name would be curiosity.<br><br>Kids are curious, but the curiosity I mean has a different shape from kid
curiosity.  Kid curiosity is broad and shallow; they ask why at
random about everything.  In most adults this curiosity dries up
entirely.  It has to: you can't get anything done if you're always
asking why about everything.  But in ambitious adults, instead of
drying up, curiosity becomes narrow and deep.  The mud flat morphs
into a well.<br><br>Curiosity turns work into play.  For Einstein, relativity wasn't a
book full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam.  It was a
mystery he was trying to solve.  So it probably felt like less work
to him to invent it than it would seem to someone now to learn it
in a class.<br><br>One of the most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea
that doing great things requires a lot of discipline.  Most subjects
are taught in such a boring way that it's only by discipline that
you can flog yourself through them.  So I was surprised when, early
in college, I read a quote by Wittgenstein saying that he had no 
self-discipline and had never been able to deny himself anything, 
not even a cup of coffee.<br><br>Now I know a number of people who do great work, and it's the same
with all of them.  They have little discipline.  They're all terrible
procrastinators and find it almost impossible to make themselves
do anything they're not interested in.  One still hasn't sent out
his half of the thank-you notes from his wedding, four years ago.
Another has 26,000 emails in her inbox.<br><br>I'm not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline.  You 
probably need about the amount you need to go running.  I'm often  
reluctant to go running, but once I do, I enjoy it.  And if I don't  
run for several days, I feel ill.  It's the same with people who 
do great things.  They know they'll feel bad if they don't work,
and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks
to start working.  But once they get started, interest takes over,
and discipline is no longer necessary.<br><br>Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently
trying to write Great Literature?  Of course not.  He was having
fun.  That's why he's so good.<br><br>If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity   
about a promising question.   The critical moment for Einstein
was when he looked at Maxwell's equations and said, what the hell
is going on here?<br><br>It can take years to zero in on a productive question, because it
can take years to figure out what a subject is really about.  To
take an extreme example, consider math.  Most people think they
hate math, but the boring stuff you do in school under the name
"mathematics" is not at all like what mathematicians do.<br><br>The great mathematician G. H.  Hardy said he didn't like math in 
high school either.  He only took it up because he was better at
it than the other students.  Only later did he realize math was
interesting — only later did he start to ask questions instead of
merely answering them correctly.<br><br>When a friend of mine used to grumble because he had to write a
paper for school, his mother would tell him: find a way to make it
interesting.  That's what you need to do: find a question that makes
the world interesting.  People who do great things look at the same
world everyone else does, but notice some odd detail that's
compellingly mysterious.<br><br>And not only in intellectual matters.  Henry Ford's great question 
was, why do cars have to be a luxury item?  What would happen if
you treated them as a commodity?  Franz Beckenbauer's was, in effect,
why does everyone have to stay in his position?  Why can't defenders
score goals too?<br><br><b>Now</b><br><br>If it takes years to articulate great questions, what do you do now,
at sixteen?  Work toward finding one.  Great questions don't appear
suddenly.  They gradually congeal in your head.  And what makes
them congeal is experience.  So the way to find great questions is
not to search for them — not to wander about thinking, what great  
discovery shall I make?  You can't answer that; if you could, you'd 
have made it.<br><br>The way to get a big idea to appear in your head is not to hunt for
big ideas, but to put in a lot of time on work that interests you,
and in the process keep your mind open enough that a big idea can
take roost.  Einstein, Ford, and Beckenbauer all used this recipe.
They all knew their work like a piano player knows the keys.  So  
when something seemed amiss to them, they had the confidence to
notice it.<br><br>Put in time how and on what?  Just pick a project that seems
interesting: to master some chunk of material, or to make something,
or to answer some question.  Choose a project that will take less
than a month, and make it something you have the means to finish.
Do something hard enough to stretch you, but only just, especially 
at first.  If you're deciding between two projects, choose whichever 
seems most fun. If one blows up in your face, start another.  Repeat
till, like an internal combustion engine, the process becomes   
self-sustaining, and each project generates the next one.  (This
could take years.)<br><br>It may be just as well not to do a project "for school," if that
will restrict you or make it seem like work.  Involve your friends
if you want, but not too many, and only if they're not flakes.  
Friends offer moral support (few startups are started by one person),
but secrecy also has its advantages.  There's something pleasing
about a secret project.  And you can take more risks, because no  
one will know if you fail.<br><br>Don't worry if a project doesn't seem to be on the path to some
goal you're supposed to have. Paths can bend a lot more than you
think.  So let the path grow out the project.  The most important
thing is to be excited about it, because it's by doing that you 
learn.<br><br>Don't disregard unseemly motivations.  One of the most powerful is
the desire to be better than other people at something.  Hardy said
that's what got him started, and I think the only unusual thing  
about him is that he admitted it.  Another powerful motivator is
the desire to do, or know, things you're not supposed to.  Closely
related is the desire to do something audacious.  Sixteen year olds
aren't supposed to write novels.  So if you try, anything you achieve
is on the plus side of the ledger; if you fail utterly, you're doing
no worse than expectations.  [8]<br><br>Beware of bad models.  Especially when they excuse laziness.  When  
I was in high school I used to write "existentialist" short stories
like ones I'd seen by famous writers.  My stories didn't have a lot
of plot, but they were very deep.  And they were less work to write
than entertaining ones would have been.  I should have known that
was a danger sign.  And in fact I found my stories pretty boring;  
what excited me was the idea of writing serious, intellectual stuff
like the famous writers.<br><br>Now I have enough experience to realize that those famous writers
actually sucked.  Plenty of famous people do; in the short term,
the quality of one's work is only a small component of fame.  
I should have been less worried about doing something
that seemed cool, and just done something I liked.  That's the
actual road to coolness anyway.<br><br>A key ingredient in many projects, almost a project on its own, is 
to find good books.  Most books are bad.  Nearly all textbooks are
bad. [9]  So don't assume a subject is to be learned from whatever
book on it happens to be closest.  You have to search actively for 
the tiny number of good books.<br><br>The important thing is to get out there and do stuff.  Instead of
waiting to be taught, go out and learn.<br><br>Your life doesn't have to be shaped by admissions officers.  It  
could be shaped by your own curiosity.  It is for all ambitious   
adults.  And you don't have to wait to start.  In fact, you don't 
have to wait to be an adult.  There's no switch inside you that
magically flips when you turn a certain age or graduate from some
institution.  You start being an adult when you decide to take
responsibility for your life.  You can do that at any age.  [10]<br><br>This may sound like bullshit.  I'm just a minor, you may think, I
have no money, I have to live at home, I have to do what adults  
tell me all day long.  Well, most adults labor under restrictions  
just as cumbersome, and they manage to get things done.  If you
think it's restrictive being a kid, imagine having kids.<br><br>The only real difference between adults and high school kids is
that adults realize they need to get things done, and high school
kids don't.  That realization hits most people around 23.  But I'm
letting you in on the secret early.  So get to work.  Maybe you can
be the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn't
how much time you wasted.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] A doctor friend warns that even this can give an inaccurate 
picture. "Who knew how much time it would take up, how little
autonomy one would have for endless years of training, and how
unbelievably annoying it is to carry a beeper?"<br><br>[2] His best bet would probably be to become dictator and intimidate
the NBA into letting him play.  So far the closest anyone has come
is Secretary of Labor.<br><br>[3] A day job is one you take to pay the bills so you can do what
you really want, like play in a band, or invent relativity.<br><br>Treating high school as a day job might actually make it easier for
some students to get good grades.  If you treat your classes
as a game, you won't be demoralized if they seem pointless.<br><br>However bad your classes, you need to get good grades in them to   
get into a decent college.  And that <i>is</i> worth doing, because
universities are where a lot of the clumps of smart people are these
days.<br><br>[4] The second biggest regret was caring so much about unimportant
things.  And especially about what other people thought of them.<br><br>I think what they really mean, in the latter case, is caring what
random people thought of them.  Adults care just as much what other
people think, but they get to be more selective about the other
people.<br><br>I have about thirty friends whose opinions I care about,
and the opinion of the rest of the world barely affects me.  The
problem in high school is that your peers are chosen for you by    
accidents of age and geography, rather than by you based on respect
for their judgement.<br><br>[5] The key to wasting time is distraction.  Without distractions
it's too obvious to your brain that you're not doing anything with
it, and you start to feel uncomfortable.  If you want to measure 
how dependent you've become on distractions, try this experiment:
set aside a chunk of time on a weekend and sit alone and think.
You can have a notebook to write your thoughts down in, but nothing
else: no friends, TV, music, phone, IM, email, Web, games, books, 
newspapers, or magazines.  Within an hour most people will feel a 
strong craving for distraction.<br><br>[6] I don't mean to imply that the only function of prep schools
is to trick admissions officers.  They also generally provide a 
better education.  But try this thought experiment: suppose prep
schools supplied the same superior education but had a tiny (.001)
negative effect on college admissions.  How many parents would still
send their kids to them?<br><br>It might also be argued that kids who went to prep schools, because
they've learned more, <i>are</i> better college candidates.  But
this seems empirically false.  What you learn in even the best high
school is rounding error compared to what you learn in college.  
Public school kids arrive at college with a slight disadvantage,  
but they start to pull ahead in the sophomore year.<br><br>(I'm not saying public school kids are smarter than preppies, just
that they are within any given college.  That follows necessarily
if you agree prep schools improve kids' admissions prospects.)<br><br>[7] Why does society foul you?  Indifference, mainly.  There are
simply no outside forces pushing high school to be good.  The air
traffic control system works because planes would crash otherwise.
Businesses have to deliver because otherwise competitors would take
their customers.  But no planes crash if your school sucks, and it
has no competitors.  High school isn't evil; it's random; but random
is pretty bad.<br><br>[8] And then of course there is money.  It's not a big factor in
high school, because you can't do much that anyone wants.  But a
lot of great things were created mainly to make money.  Samuel
Johnson said "no man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money."
(Many hope he was exaggerating.)<br><br>[9] Even college textbooks are bad.  When you get to college,
you'll find that (with a few stellar exceptions) the textbooks are
not written by the leading scholars in the field they describe.
Writing college textbooks is unpleasant work, done mostly by people
who need the money.  It's unpleasant because the publishers exert
so much control, and there are few things worse than close supervision
by someone who doesn't understand what you're doing.  This phenomenon
is apparently 
<a href="http://www.edutopia.org/muddle-machine">even worse</a> in the production of high school textbooks.<br><br>[10] Your teachers are always telling you to behave like adults.
I wonder if they'd like it if you did.  You may be loud and
disorganized, but you're very docile compared to adults.  If you
actually started acting like adults, it would be just as if a bunch
of adults had been transposed into your bodies.  Imagine the reaction
of an FBI agent or taxi driver or reporter to being told they had
to ask permission to go the bathroom, and only one person could go
at a time.  To say nothing of the things you're taught.  If a bunch
of actual adults suddenly found themselves trapped in high school,
the first thing they'd do is form a union and renegotiate all the
rules with the administration.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Ingrid Bassett, Trevor Blackwell,

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
March 2005<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at the Harvard Computer
Society.)</i><br><br>You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with
good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend
as little money as possible.  Most startups that fail do it because
they fail at one of these.  A startup that does all three will
probably succeed.<br><br>And that's kind of exciting, when you think about it, because all
three are doable.  Hard, but doable.  And since a startup that
succeeds ordinarily makes its founders rich, that implies getting
rich is doable too.  Hard, but doable.<br><br>If there is one message I'd like to get across about startups,
that's it.  There is no magically difficult step that requires
brilliance to solve.<br><br><b>The Idea</b><br><br>In particular, you don't need a brilliant 
<a href="ideas.html">idea</a> to start a startup
around.   The way a startup makes money is to offer people better
technology than they have now.  But what people have now is often
so bad that it doesn't take brilliance to do better.<br><br>Google's plan, for example, was simply to create a search site that
didn't suck.  They had three new ideas: index more of the Web, use
links to rank search results, and have clean, simple web pages with
unintrusive keyword-based ads.  Above all, they were determined to
make a site that was good to use.  No doubt there are great technical
tricks within Google, but the overall plan was straightforward.
And while they probably have bigger ambitions now, this alone brings
them a billion dollars a year. [1]<br><br>There are plenty of other areas that are just as backward as search
was before Google.  I can think of several heuristics for generating
ideas for startups, but most reduce to this: look at something
people are trying to do, and figure out how to do it in a way that
doesn't suck.<br><br>For example, dating sites currently suck far worse than search did
before Google.  They all use the same simple-minded model.
They seem to have approached the problem by thinking about how to
do database matches instead of how dating works in the real world.
An undergrad could build something better as a class project.  And
yet there's a lot of money at stake.  Online dating is a valuable
business now, and it might be worth a hundred times as much if it
worked.<br><br>An idea for a startup, however, is only a beginning.  A lot of
would-be startup founders think the key to the whole process is the
initial idea, and from that point all you have to do is execute.
Venture capitalists know better.  If you go to VC firms with a
brilliant idea that you'll tell them about if they sign a nondisclosure
agreement, most will tell you to get lost.   That shows how much a 
mere idea is worth. The market price is less than the inconvenience 
of signing an NDA.<br><br>Another sign of how little the initial idea is worth is the number
of startups that change their plan en route. Microsoft's original
plan was to make money selling programming languages, of all things.
Their current business model didn't occur to them until IBM dropped
it in their lap five years later.<br><br>Ideas for startups are worth something, certainly, but the trouble
is, they're not transferrable.  They're not something you could
hand to someone else to execute.  Their value is mainly as starting
points: as questions for the people who had them to continue thinking
about.<br><br>What matters is not ideas, but the people who have them.  Good
people can fix bad ideas, but good ideas can't save bad people.  
<!-- So let's talk about people. --><br><br><b>People</b><br><br>What do I mean by good people?  One of the best tricks I learned   
during <a href="road.html">our</a> startup was a rule for deciding 
who to hire.  Could you
describe the person as an animal?  It might be hard to translate   
that into another language, but I think everyone in the US knows  
what it means.  It means someone who takes their work a little too   
seriously; someone who does what they do so well that they pass
right through professional and cross over into obsessive.<br><br>What it means specifically depends on the job: a salesperson who
just won't take no for an answer; a hacker who will stay up till   
4:00 AM rather than go to bed leaving code with a bug in it; a PR   
person who will cold-call <i>New York Times</i> reporters on their cell
phones; a graphic designer who feels physical pain when something 
is two millimeters out of place.<br><br>Almost everyone who worked for us was an animal at what they did. 
The woman in charge of sales was so tenacious that I used to feel
sorry for potential customers on the phone with her.  You could  
sense them squirming on the hook, but you knew there would be no  
rest for them till they'd signed up.<br><br>If you think about people you know, you'll find the animal test is
easy to apply.  Call the person's image to mind and imagine the
sentence "so-and-so is an animal."  If you laugh, they're not.  You
don't need or perhaps even want this quality in big companies, but
you need it in a startup.<br><br>For programmers we had three additional tests.  Was the person
genuinely smart?  If so, could they actually get things done?  And
finally, since a few good hackers have unbearable personalities,   
could we stand to have them around?<br><br>That last test filters out surprisingly few people.  We could bear
any amount of nerdiness if someone was truly smart.  What we couldn't
stand were people with a lot of attitude.  But most of those weren't
truly smart, so our third test was largely a restatement of the
first.<br><br>When nerds are unbearable it's usually because they're trying too
hard to seem smart.  But the smarter they are, the less pressure
they feel to act smart.  So as a rule you can recognize genuinely
smart people by their ability to say things like "I don't know,"   
"Maybe you're right," and "I don't understand x well enough."<br><br>This technique doesn't always work, because people can be influenced
by their environment.  In the MIT CS department, there seems to be
a tradition of acting like a brusque know-it-all. I'm told it derives
ultimately from Marvin Minsky, in the same way the classic airline
pilot manner is said to derive from Chuck Yeager.  Even genuinely
smart people start to act this way there, so you have to make
allowances.<br><br>It helped us to have Robert Morris, who is one of the readiest to
say "I don't know" of anyone I've met.  (At least, he was before he 
became a professor at MIT.)  No one dared put on attitude around   
Robert, because he was obviously smarter than they were and yet had
zero attitude himself.<br><br>Like most startups, ours began with a group of friends, and it was
through personal contacts that we got most of the people we hired.
This is a crucial difference between startups and big companies.
Being friends with someone for even a couple days will tell you 
more than companies could ever learn in interviews.  [2]<br><br>It's no coincidence that startups start around universities, because
that's where smart people meet.  It's not what people learn in    
classes at MIT and Stanford that has made technology companies
spring up around them.  They could sing campfire songs in the classes
so long as admissions worked the same.<br><br>If you start a startup, there's a good chance it will be with people
you know from college or grad school.  So in theory you ought to  
try to make friends with as many smart people as you can in school,
right?  Well, no.  Don't make a conscious effort to schmooze; that
doesn't work well with hackers.<br><br>What you should do in college is work on your own projects.  Hackers
should do this even if they don't plan to start startups, because 
it's the only real way to learn how to program.   In some cases you
may collaborate with other students, and this is the best way to
get to know good hackers.  The project may even grow into a startup.
But once again, I wouldn't aim too directly at either target.  Don't
force things; just work on stuff you like with people you like.<br><br>Ideally you want between two and four founders.  It would be hard
to start with just one.  One person would find the moral weight of
starting a company hard to bear.  Even Bill Gates, who seems to be   
able to bear a good deal of moral weight, had to have a co-founder. 
But you don't want so many founders that the company starts to look
like a group photo.  Partly because you don't need a lot of people
at first, but mainly because the more founders you have, the worse
disagreements you'll have. When there are just two or three founders,
you know you have to resolve disputes immediately or perish.  If
there are seven or eight, disagreements can linger and harden into
factions.  You don't want mere voting; you need unanimity.<br><br>In a technology startup, which most startups are, the founders
should include technical people.   During the Internet Bubble there 
were a number of startups founded by business people who then went
looking for hackers to create their product for them.  This doesn't  
work well.  Business people are bad at deciding what to do with   
technology, because they don't know what the options are, or which
kinds of problems are hard and which are easy.  And when business
people try to hire hackers, they can't tell which ones are 
<a href="gh.html">good</a>.
Even other hackers have a hard time doing that. 
For business people it's roulette.<br><br>Do the founders of a startup have to include business people?  That
depends.  We thought so when we started ours, and we asked several 
people who were said to know about this mysterious thing called
"business" if they would be the president.  But they all said no,
so I had to do it myself.  And what I discovered was that business
was no great mystery.   It's not something like physics or medicine
that requires extensive study.  You just try to get people to pay
you for stuff.<br><br>I think the reason I made such a mystery of business was that I was
disgusted by the idea of doing it.  I wanted to work in the pure,   
intellectual world of software, not deal with customers' mundane  
problems.  People who don't want to get dragged into some kind of
work often develop a protective incompetence at it.  Paul Erdos was
particularly good at this.  By seeming unable even to cut a grapefruit
in half (let alone go to the store and buy one), he forced other
people to do such things for him, leaving all his time free for
math.  Erdos was an extreme case, but most husbands use the same  
trick to some degree.<br><br>Once I was forced to discard my protective incompetence, I found
that business was neither so hard nor so boring as I feared.  There
are esoteric areas of business that are quite hard, like tax law
or the pricing of derivatives, but you don't need to know about   
those in a startup.  All you need to know about business to run a  
startup are commonsense things people knew before there were business
schools, or even universities.<br><br>If you work your way down the Forbes 400 making an x next to the   
name of each person with an MBA, you'll learn something important
about business school.  After Warren Buffett, you don't hit another 
MBA till number 22,
Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike.  There are only 5 MBAs in the top
50.  What you notice in the Forbes 400 are a lot of people with      
technical backgrounds.  Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison,
Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore.  The rulers of the technology
business tend to come from technology, not business.  So if you   
want to invest two years in something that will help you succeed  
in business, the evidence suggests you'd do better to learn how to   
hack than get an MBA. [3]<br><br>There is one reason you might want to include business people in a
startup, though: because you have to have at least one person willing
and able to focus on what customers want. Some believe only business
people can do this-- that hackers can implement software, but not   
design it.  That's nonsense.  There's nothing about knowing how to
program that prevents hackers from understanding users, or about
not knowing how to program that magically enables business people 
to understand them.<br><br>If you can't understand users, however, you should either learn how
or find a co-founder who can.  That is the single most important
issue for technology startups, and the rock that sinks more of them
than anything else.<br><br><b>What Customers Want</b><br><br>It's not just startups that have to worry about this.  I think most
businesses that fail do it because they don't give customers what
they want.  Look at restaurants.  A large percentage fail, about a
quarter in the first year.  But can you think of one restaurant
that had really good food and went out of business?<br><br>Restaurants with great food seem to prosper no matter what.  A    
restaurant with great food can be expensive, crowded, noisy, dingy,
out of the way, and even have bad service, and people will keep
coming.  It's true that a restaurant with mediocre food can sometimes 
attract customers through gimmicks.  But that approach is very  
risky.  It's more straightforward just to make the food good.<br><br>It's the same with technology.  You hear all kinds of reasons why
startups fail.  But can you think of one that had a massively popular
product and still failed?<br><br>In nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customers
didn't want the product.  For most, the cause of death is listed  
as "ran out of funding," but that's only the immediate cause.  Why 
couldn't they get more funding?  Probably because the product was
a dog, or never seemed likely to be done, or both.<br><br>When I was trying to think of the things every startup needed to   
do, I almost included a fourth: get a version 1 out as soon as you
can.  But I decided not to, because that's implicit in making
something customers want.  The only way to make something customers
want is to get a prototype in front of them and refine it based on   
their reactions.<br><br>The other approach is what I call the "Hail Mary" strategy.  You  
make elaborate plans for a product, hire a team of engineers to   
develop it (people who do this tend to use the term "engineer" for   
hackers), and then find after a year that you've spent two million
dollars to develop something no one wants.  This was not uncommon
during the Bubble, especially in companies run by business types, 
who thought of software development as something terrifying that
therefore had to be carefully planned.<br><br>We never even considered that approach.  As a Lisp hacker, I come 
from the tradition of rapid prototyping.  I would not claim (at
least, not here) that this is the right way to write every program,
but it's certainly the right way to write software for a startup.
In a startup, your initial plans are almost certain to be wrong in
some way, and your first priority should be to figure out where.   
The only way to do that is to try implementing them.<br><br>Like most startups, we changed our plan on the fly.  At first we
expected our customers to be Web consultants.  But it turned out
they didn't like us, because our software was easy to use and we hosted
the site.  It would be too easy for clients to fire them.  We also
thought we'd be able to sign up a lot of catalog companies, because
selling online was a natural extension of their existing business.
But in 1996 that was a hard sell.  The middle managers we talked   
to at catalog companies saw the Web not as an opportunity, but as
something that meant more work for them.<br><br>We did get a few of the more adventurous catalog companies.  Among
them was Frederick's of Hollywood, which gave us valuable experience
dealing with heavy loads on our servers.  But most of our users   
were small, individual merchants who saw the Web as an opportunity 
to build a business.  Some had retail stores, but many only existed
online.  And so we changed direction to focus on these users.
Instead of concentrating on the features Web consultants and catalog
companies would want, we worked to make the software easy to use.<br><br>I learned something valuable from that.  It's worth trying very, 
very hard to make technology easy to use.  Hackers are so used to
computers that they have no idea how horrifying software seems to
normal people.  Stephen Hawking's editor told him that every equation
he included in his book would cut sales in half.  When you work on
making technology easier to use, you're riding that curve up instead  
of down. A 10% improvement in ease of use doesn't just increase    
your sales 10%.  It's more likely to double your sales.<br><br>How do you figure out what customers want?  Watch them.  One of the
best places to do this was at trade shows.  Trade shows didn't pay 
as a way of getting new customers, but they were worth it as market
research.  We didn't just give canned presentations at trade shows.
We used to show people how to build real, working stores.  Which   
meant we got to watch as they used our software, and talk to them    
about what they needed.<br><br>No matter what kind of startup you start, it will probably be a   
stretch for you, the founders, to understand what users want.  The
only kind of software you can build without studying users is the    
sort for which you are the typical user.  But this is just the kind
that tends to be open source: operating systems, programming
languages, editors, and so on.  So if you're developing technology
for money, you're probably not going to be developing it for people
like you.  Indeed, you can use this as a way to generate ideas for
startups: what do people who are not like you want from technology?<br><br>When most people think of startups, they think of companies like
Apple or Google.  Everyone knows these, because they're big consumer
brands.  But for every startup like that, there are twenty more  
that operate in niche markets or live quietly down in the infrastructure.
So if you start a successful startup, odds are you'll start one of 
those.<br><br>Another way to say that is, if you try to start the kind of startup
that has to be a big consumer brand, the odds against succeeding
are steeper.  The best odds are in niche markets.  Since startups  
make money by offering people something better than they had before,
the best opportunities are where things suck most.  And it would   
be hard to find a place where things suck more than in corporate  
IT departments.  You would not believe the amount of money companies
spend on software, and the crap they get in return.  This imbalance
equals opportunity.<br><br>If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things you
could do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a  
couple weeks just watching what they do with computers.  Most good
hackers have no more idea of the horrors perpetrated in these places
than rich Americans do of what goes on in Brazilian slums.<br><br>Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it's easier
to sell to them.  It's worth so much to sell stuff to big companies
that the people selling them the crap they currently use spend a
lot of time and money to do it.  And while you can outhack Oracle
with one frontal lobe tied behind your back, you can't outsell an
Oracle salesman.  So if you want to win through better technology,
aim at smaller customers.  [4]<br><br>They're the more strategically valuable part of the market anyway.    
In technology, the low end always eats the high end.  It's easier  
to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful
product cheaper.  So the products that start as cheap, simple options
tend to gradually grow more powerful till, like water rising in a  
room, they squash the "high-end" products against the ceiling.  Sun
did this to mainframes, and Intel is doing it to Sun.  Microsoft
Word did it to desktop publishing software like Interleaf and
Framemaker.  Mass-market digital cameras are doing it to the expensive
models made for professionals.  Avid did it to the manufacturers     
of specialized video editing systems, and now Apple is doing it to
Avid.  <i>Henry Ford</i> did it to the car makers that preceded
him.  If you build the simple, inexpensive option, you'll not only
find it easier to sell at first, but you'll also be in the best   
position to conquer the rest of the market.<br><br>It's very dangerous to let anyone fly under you.  If you have the
cheapest, easiest product, you'll own the low end.  And if you
don't, you're in the crosshairs of whoever does.<br><br><b>Raising Money</b><br><br>To make all this happen, you're going to need money.  Some startups
have been self-funding-- Microsoft for example-- but most aren't.
I think it's wise to take money from investors.  To be self-funding,
you have to start as a consulting company, and it's hard to switch
from that to a product company.<br><br>Financially, a startup is like a pass/fail course.  The way to get
rich from a startup is to maximize the company's chances of succeeding,
not to maximize the amount of stock you retain.  So if you can trade
stock for something that improves your odds, it's probably a smart 
move.<br><br>To most hackers, getting investors seems like a terrifying and
mysterious process.  Actually it's merely tedious.  I'll try to
give an outline of how it works.<br><br>The first thing you'll need is a few tens of thousands of dollars   
to pay your expenses while you develop a prototype.  This is called
seed capital.  Because so little money is involved, raising seed
capital is comparatively easy-- at least in the sense of getting a
quick yes or no.<br><br>Usually you get seed money from individual rich people called
"angels." Often they're people who themselves got rich from technology.
At the seed stage, investors don't expect you to have an elaborate
business plan.  Most know that they're supposed to decide quickly.
It's not unusual to get a check within a week based on a half-page
agreement.<br><br>We started Viaweb with $10,000 of seed money from our friend Julian.
But he gave us a lot more than money.  He's a former CEO and also
a corporate lawyer, so he gave us a lot of valuable advice about
business, and also did all the legal work of getting us set up as
a company.  Plus he introduced us to one of the two 
angel investors who supplied our next round of funding.<br><br>Some angels, especially those with technology backgrounds, may be     
satisfied with a demo and a verbal description of what you plan to 
do.  But many will want a copy of your business plan, if only to
remind themselves what they invested in.<br><br>Our angels asked for one, and looking back, I'm amazed how much
worry it caused me.  "Business plan" has that word "business" in
it, so I figured it had to be something I'd have to read a book
about business plans to write.  Well, it doesn't.  At this stage,
all most investors expect is a brief description of what you plan    
to do and how you're going to make money from it, and the resumes 
of the founders.  If you just sit down and write out what you've
been saying to one another, that should be fine.  It shouldn't take
more than a couple hours, and you'll probably find that writing it
all down gives you more ideas about what to do.<br><br>For the angel to have someone to make the check out to, you're going
to have to have some kind of company.  Merely incorporating yourselves
isn't hard.  The problem is, for the company to exist, you have to
decide who the founders are, and how much stock they each have.  If
there are two founders with the same qualifications who are both
equally committed to the business, that's easy.  But if you have a
number of people who are expected to contribute in varying degrees,
arranging the proportions of stock can be hard.  And once you've
done it, it tends to be set in stone.<br><br>I have no tricks for dealing with this problem.  All I can say is,
try hard to do it right.  I do have a rule of thumb for recognizing
when you have, though.  When everyone feels they're getting a
slightly bad deal, that they're doing more than they should for the
amount of stock they have, the stock is optimally apportioned.<br><br>There is more to setting up a company than incorporating it, of
course: insurance, business license, unemployment compensation,    
various things with the IRS.  I'm not even sure what the list is,
because we, ah, skipped all that.  When we got real funding near
the end of 1996, we hired a great CFO, who fixed everything   
retroactively.  It turns out that no one comes and arrests you if
you don't do everything you're supposed to when starting a company.
And a good thing too, or a lot of startups would never get started.
[5]<br><br>It can be dangerous to delay turning yourself into a company, because
one or more of the founders might decide to split off and start   
another company doing the same thing.  This does happen.  So when
you set up the company, as well as as apportioning the stock, you
should get all the founders to sign something agreeing that everyone's
ideas belong to this company, and that this company is going to be
everyone's only job.<br><br>[If this were a movie, ominous music would begin here.]<br><br>While you're at it, you should ask what else they've signed.  One
of the worst things that can happen to a startup is to run into       
intellectual property problems.  We did, and it came closer to 
killing us than any competitor ever did.<br><br>As we were in the middle of getting bought, we discovered that one
of our people had, early on, been bound by an agreement that said
all his ideas belonged to the giant company that was paying for him
to go to grad school.  In theory, that could have meant someone
else owned big chunks of our software.  So the acquisition came to
a screeching halt while we tried to sort this out.  The problem      
was, since we'd been about to be acquired, we'd allowed ourselves 
to run low on cash.  Now we needed to raise more to keep going. 
But it's hard to raise money with an IP cloud over your head, because
investors can't judge how serious it is.<br><br>Our existing investors, knowing that we needed money and had nowhere
else to get it, at this point attempted certain gambits which I
will not describe in detail, except to remind readers that the word   
"angel" is a metaphor.  The founders thereupon proposed to walk   
away from the company, after giving the investors a brief tutorial 
on how to administer the servers themselves.  And while this was
happening, the acquirers used the delay as an excuse to welch on  
the deal.<br><br>Miraculously it all turned out ok.  The investors backed down; we
did another round of funding at a reasonable valuation; the giant
company finally gave us a piece of paper saying they didn't own our
software; and six months later we were bought by Yahoo for much
more than the earlier acquirer had agreed to pay.  So we were happy
in the end, though the experience probably took several years off  
my life.<br><br>Don't do what we did.  Before you consummate a startup, ask 
everyone about their previous IP history.<br><br>Once you've got a company set up, it may seem presumptuous to go
knocking on the doors of rich people and asking them to invest tens
of thousands of dollars in something that is really just a bunch 
of guys with some ideas.  But when you look at it from the rich
people's point of view, the picture is more encouraging. Most rich 
people are looking for good investments.  If you really think you
have a chance of succeeding, you're doing them a favor by letting
them invest.  Mixed with any annoyance they might feel about being   
approached will be the thought: are these guys the next Google?<br><br>Usually angels are financially equivalent to founders.  They get 
the same kind of stock and get diluted the same amount in future
rounds.  How much stock should they get?  That depends on how
ambitious you feel.  When you offer x percent of your company for
y dollars, you're implicitly claiming a certain value for the whole
company.  Venture investments are usually described in terms of
that number.  If you give an investor new shares equal to 5% of
those already outstanding in return for $100,000, then you've done
the deal at a pre-money valuation of $2 million.<br><br>How do you decide what the value of the company should be?  There
is no rational way.  At this stage the company is just a bet.  I
didn't realize that when we were raising money.  Julian
thought we ought to value the company at several million 
dollars.  I thought it was preposterous to claim that a couple
thousand lines of code, which was all we had at the time, were worth
several million dollars.  Eventually we settled on one million,
because Julian said no one would invest in a company with a valuation
any lower. [6]<br><br>What I didn't grasp at the time was that the valuation wasn't just   
the value of the code we'd written so far.  It was also the value
of our ideas, which turned out to be right, and of all the future
work we'd do, which turned out to be a lot.<br><br>The next round of funding is the one in which you might deal with 
actual 
<a href="venturecapital.html">venture capital firms</a>.  
But don't wait till you've burned   
through your last round of funding to start approaching them.  VCs are slow to
make up their minds.  They can take months.  You don't want to be 
running out of money while you're trying to negotiate with them.<br><br>Getting money from an actual VC firm is a bigger deal than getting
money from angels.  The amounts of money involved are larger, millions
usually.  So the deals take longer, dilute you more, and impose
more onerous conditions.<br><br>Sometimes the VCs want to install a new CEO of their own choosing. 
Usually the claim is that you need someone mature and experienced,
with a business background.  Maybe in some cases this is true.   And
yet Bill Gates was young and inexperienced and had no business 
background, and he seems to have done ok.  Steve Jobs got booted
out of his own company by someone mature and experienced, with a
business background, who then proceeded to ruin the company.  So I
think people who are mature and experienced, with a business
background, may be overrated.  We used to call these guys "newscasters,"
because they had neat hair and spoke in deep, confident voices, and
generally didn't know much more than they read on the teleprompter.<br><br>We talked to a number of VCs, but eventually we ended up financing
our startup entirely with angel money.  The main reason was that     
we feared a brand-name VC firm would stick us with a newscaster as
part of the deal.  That might have been ok if he was content to
limit himself to talking to the press, but what if he wanted to  
have a say in running the company?   That would have led to disaster,
because our software was so complex.  We were a company whose whole
m.o. was to win through better technology.  The strategic decisions
were mostly decisions about technology, and we didn't need any help
with those.<br><br>This was also one reason we didn't go public.  Back in 1998 our CFO
tried to talk me into it.  In those days you could go public as a
dogfood portal, so as a company with a real product and real revenues,
we might have done well.  But I feared it would have meant taking
on a newscaster-- someone who, as they say, "can talk Wall Street's
language."<br><br>I'm happy to see Google is bucking that trend.  They didn't talk
Wall Street's language when they did their IPO, and Wall Street
didn't buy.  And now Wall Street is collectively kicking itself.
They'll pay attention next time.  Wall Street learns new languages   
fast when money is involved.<br><br>You have more leverage negotiating with VCs than you realize.  The   
reason is other VCs.  I know a number of VCs now, and when you talk
to them you realize that it's a seller's market.  Even now there
is too much money chasing too few good deals.<br><br>VCs form a pyramid.  At the top are famous ones like Sequoia and
Kleiner Perkins, but beneath those are a huge number you've never 
heard of.  What they all have in common is that a dollar from them 
is worth one dollar.  Most VCs will tell you that they don't just 
provide money, but connections and advice.  If you're talking to  
Vinod Khosla or John Doerr or Mike Moritz, this is true.  But such
advice and connections can come very expensive.  And as you go down
the food chain the VCs get rapidly 
<!-- href="http://ricksegal.typepad.com/pmv/2005/03/vcs_suck_shocki.html"-->
dumber.  A few steps down from 
the top you're basically talking to bankers who've picked up a few
new vocabulary words from reading <i>Wired</i>.  (Does your product
use <i>XML?</i>)  So I'd advise you to be skeptical about claims
of experience and connections.  Basically, a VC is a source of
money.  I'd be inclined to go with whoever offered the most money  
the soonest with the least strings attached.<br><br>You may wonder how much to tell VCs.  And you should, because some
of them may one day be funding your competitors.  I think the best
plan is not to be overtly secretive, but not to tell them everything
either.  After all, as most VCs say, they're more interested in the
people than the ideas.  The main reason they want to talk about
your idea is to judge you, not the idea.  So as long as you seem
like you know what you're doing, you can probably keep a few things
back from them. [7]<br><br>Talk to as many VCs as you can, even if you don't want their money,
because a) they may be on the board of someone who will buy you,     
and b) if you seem impressive, they'll be discouraged from investing
in your competitors.  The most efficient way to reach VCs, especially
if you only want them to know about you and don't want their money,
is at the conferences that are occasionally organized for startups   
to present to them.<br><br><b>Not Spending It</b><br><br>When and if you get an infusion of real money from investors, what
should you do with it?  Not spend it, that's what.  In nearly every   
startup that fails, the proximate cause is running out of money. 
Usually there is something deeper wrong.  But even a proximate cause
of death is worth trying hard to avoid.<br><br>During the Bubble many startups tried to "get big fast." Ideally
this meant getting a lot of customers fast.  But it was easy for
the meaning to slide over into hiring a lot of people fast.<br><br>Of the two versions, the one where you get a lot of customers fast
is of course preferable.  But even that may be overrated.  The idea
is to get there first and get all the users, leaving none for
competitors.  But I think in most businesses the advantages of being
first to market are not so overwhelmingly great.  Google is again
a case in point.  When they appeared it seemed as if search was a
mature market, dominated by big players who'd spent millions to
build their brands: Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Infoseek, Altavista,  
Inktomi.  Surely 1998 was a little late to arrive at the party.<br><br>But as the founders of Google knew, brand is worth next to nothing
in the search business.  You can come along at any point and make 
something better, and users will gradually seep over to you.  As  
if to emphasize the point, Google never did any advertising.  They're
like dealers; they sell the stuff, but they know better than to use
it themselves.<br><br>The competitors Google buried would have done better to spend those
millions improving their software.  Future startups should learn
from that mistake.  Unless you're in a market where products are   
as undifferentiated as cigarettes or vodka or laundry detergent,
spending a lot on brand advertising is a sign of breakage.  And few
if any Web businesses are so undifferentiated.  The dating sites  
are running big ad campaigns right now, which is all the 
more evidence they're ripe for the picking.  (Fee, fie, fo, fum, I  
smell a company run by marketing guys.)<br><br>We were compelled by circumstances to grow slowly, and in retrospect
it was a good thing.  The founders all learned to do every job in  
the company.  As well as writing software, I had to do sales and
customer support.  At sales I was not very good.  I was persistent,
but I didn't have the smoothness of a good salesman.  My message   
to potential customers was: you'd be stupid not to sell online, and  
if you sell online you'd be stupid to use anyone else's software.   
Both statements were true, but that's not the way to convince people.<br><br>I was great at customer support though.  Imagine talking to a
customer support person who not only knew everything about the
product, but would apologize abjectly if there was a bug, and then
fix it immediately, while you were on the phone with them.  Customers
loved us.  And we loved them, because when you're growing slow by
word of mouth, your first batch of users are the ones who were smart
enough to find you by themselves.  There is nothing more valuable,
in the early stages of a startup, than smart users.  If you listen
to them, they'll tell you exactly how to make a winning product.      
And not only will they give you this advice for free, they'll pay
you.<br><br>We officially launched in early 1996.  By the end of that year we
had about 70 users.  Since this was the era of "get big fast," I
worried about how small and obscure we were.  But in fact we were
doing exactly the right thing.  Once you get big (in users or
employees) it gets hard to change your product.  That year was
effectively a laboratory for improving our software.  By the end  
of it, we were so far ahead of our competitors that they never had 
a hope of catching up.  And since all the hackers had spent many
hours talking to users, we understood online commerce way better
than anyone else.<br><br>That's the key to success as a startup.  There is nothing more 
important than understanding your business.  You might think that
anyone in a business must, ex officio, understand it.  Far from it.   
Google's secret
weapon was simply that they understood search.  I was working for 
Yahoo when Google appeared, and Yahoo didn't understand search.  I
know because I once tried to convince the powers that be that we
had to make search better, and I got in reply what was then the
party line about it: that Yahoo was no longer a mere "search engine."
Search was now only a small percentage of our page views, less than
one month's growth, and now that we were established as a "media   
company," or "portal," or whatever we were, search could safely be
allowed to wither and drop off, like an umbilical cord.<br><br>Well, a small fraction of page views they may be, but they are an  
important fraction, because they are the page views that Web sessions  
start with.  I think Yahoo gets that now.<br><br>Google understands a few other things most Web companies still
don't.  The most important is that you should put users before
advertisers, even though the advertisers are paying and users aren't.
One of my favorite bumper stickers reads "if the people lead, the  
leaders will follow." Paraphrased for the Web, this becomes "get
all the users, and the advertisers will follow."  More generally,
design your product to please users first, and then think about how
to make money from it.  If you don't put users first, you leave a    
gap for competitors who do.<br><br>To make something users love, you have to understand them.  And the
bigger you are, the harder that is.  So I say "get big slow." The
slower you burn through your funding, the more time you have to
learn.<br><br>The other reason to spend money slowly is to encourage a culture 
of cheapness.  That's something Yahoo did understand.  David Filo's 
title was "Chief Yahoo," but he was proud that his unofficial title
was "Cheap Yahoo."  Soon after we arrived at Yahoo, we got an email
from Filo, who had been crawling around our directory hierarchy,      
asking if it was really necessary to store so much of our data on
expensive RAID drives.  I was impressed by that.  Yahoo's market
cap then was already in the billions, and they were still worrying
about wasting a few gigs of disk space.<br><br>When you get a couple million dollars from a VC firm, you tend to
feel rich.  It's important to realize you're not.  A rich company
is one with large revenues.  This money isn't revenue.  It's money
investors have given you in the hope you'll be able to generate   
revenues.  So despite those millions in the bank, you're still poor.<br><br>For most startups the model should be grad student, not law firm.
Aim for cool and cheap, not expensive and impressive.  For us the
test of whether a startup understood this was whether they had Aeron
chairs.  The Aeron came out during the Bubble and was very popular
with startups.  Especially the type, all too common then, that was
like a bunch of kids playing house with money supplied by VCs.   We   
had office chairs so cheap that the arms all fell off.  This was 
slightly embarrassing at the time, but in retrospect the grad-studenty
atmosphere of our office was another of those things we did right 
without knowing it.<br><br>Our offices were in a wooden triple-decker in Harvard Square.  It
had been an apartment until about the 1970s, and there was still a   
claw-footed bathtub in the bathroom.  It must once have been inhabited
by someone fairly eccentric, because a lot of the chinks in the    
walls were stuffed with aluminum foil, as if to protect against   
cosmic rays.  When eminent visitors came to see us, we were a bit
sheepish about the low production values.  But in fact that place
was the perfect space for a startup.  We felt like our role was to 
be impudent underdogs instead of corporate stuffed shirts, and that    
is exactly the spirit you want.<br><br>An apartment is also the right kind of place for developing software.
Cube farms suck for that, as you've probably discovered if you've
tried it.  Ever notice how much easier it is to hack at home than
at work?  So why not make work more like home?<br><br>When you're looking for space for a startup, don't feel that it has
to look professional.  Professional means doing good work, not
elevators and glass walls.  I'd advise most startups to avoid
corporate space at first and just rent an apartment.  You want to
live at the office in a startup, so why not have a place designed
to be lived in as your office?<br><br>Besides being cheaper and better to work in, apartments tend to be
in better locations than office buildings.  And for a startup
location is very important.  The key to productivity is for people
to come back to work after dinner.  Those hours after the phone
stops ringing are by far the best for getting work done.  Great
things happen when a group of employees go out to dinner together, 
talk over ideas, and then come back to their offices to implement  
them.  So you want to be in a place where there are a lot of
restaurants around, not some dreary office park that's a wasteland
after 6:00 PM.  Once a company shifts over into the model where 
everyone drives home to the suburbs for dinner, however late, you've
lost something extraordinarily valuable.  God help you if you
actually start in that mode.<br><br>If I were going to start a startup today, there are only three   
places I'd consider doing it: on the Red Line near Central, Harvard,
or Davis Squares (Kendall is too sterile); in Palo Alto on University
or California Aves; and in Berkeley immediately north or south of   
campus.  These are the only places I know that have the right kind
of vibe.<br><br>The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people.  
I may be an extremist, but I think hiring people is the worst thing
a company can do.  To start with, people are a recurring expense, 
which is the worst kind.  They also tend to cause you to grow out     
of your space, and perhaps even move to the sort of uncool office
building that will make your software worse.  But worst of all,
they slow you down: instead of sticking your head in someone's    
office and checking out an idea with them, eight people have to
have a meeting about it.  So the fewer people you can hire, the
better.<br><br>During the Bubble a lot of startups had the opposite policy.  They
wanted to get "staffed up" as soon as possible, as if you couldn't 
get anything done unless there was someone with the corresponding 
job title.  That's big company thinking.  Don't hire people to fill
the gaps in some a priori org chart.  The only reason to hire someone
is to do something you'd like to do but can't.<br><br>If hiring unnecessary people is expensive and slows you down, why
do nearly all companies do it?  I think the main reason is that
people like the idea of having a lot of people working for them.
This weakness often extends right up to the CEO.  If you ever end
up running a company, you'll find the most common question people
ask is how many employees you have.  This is their way of weighing
you.  It's not just random people who ask this; even reporters do.
And they're going to be a lot more impressed if the answer is a
thousand than if it's ten.<br><br>This is ridiculous, really.  If two companies have the same revenues,
it's the one with fewer employees that's more impressive.  When  
people used to ask me how many people our startup had, and I answered
"twenty," I could see them thinking that we didn't count for much.
I used to want to add "but our main competitor, whose ass we regularly
kick, has a hundred and forty, so can we have credit for the larger
of the two numbers?"<br><br>As with office space, the number of your employees is a choice 
between seeming impressive, and being impressive.  Any of you who  
were <a href="nerds.html">nerds</a> in high school know about this 
choice.  Keep doing it when you start a company.<br><br><b>Should You?</b><br><br>But should you start a company?  Are you the right sort of person
to do it?  If you are, is it worth it?<br><br>More people are the right sort of person to start a startup than
realize it.  That's the main reason I wrote this.  There could be   
ten times more startups than there are, and that would probably be
a good thing.<br><br>I was, I now realize, exactly the right sort of person to start a   
startup.  But the idea terrified me at first.  I was forced into   
it because I was a <a href="icad.html">Lisp</a> hacker.  The company
I'd been consulting for seemed to be running into trouble, and there  
were not a lot of other companies using Lisp.  Since I couldn't  
bear the thought of programming in another language (this was 1995,
remember, when "another language" meant C++) the only option seemed
to be to start a new company using Lisp.<br><br>I realize this sounds far-fetched, but if you're a Lisp hacker
you'll know what I mean.  And if the idea of starting a startup
frightened me so much that I only did it out of necessity, there  
must be a lot of people who would be good at it but who are too    
intimidated to try.<br><br>So who should start a startup?  Someone who is a good hacker, between
about 23 and 38, and who wants to solve the money problem in one
shot instead of getting paid gradually over a conventional working
life.<br><br>I can't say precisely what a good hacker is.  At a first rate   
university this might include the top half of computer science   
majors.  Though of course you don't have to be a CS major to be a
hacker; I was a philosophy major in college.<br><br>It's hard to tell whether you're a good hacker, especially when
you're young.  Fortunately the process of starting startups tends
to select them automatically.  What drives people to start startups
is (or should be) looking at existing technology and thinking, don't 
these guys realize they should be doing x, y, and z?  And that's 
also a sign that one is a good hacker.<br><br>I put the lower bound at 23 not because there's something that
doesn't happen to your brain till then, but because you need to see
what it's like in an existing business before you try running your
own.  The business doesn't have to be a startup.  I spent a year
working for a software company to pay off my college loans.  It was
the worst year of my adult life, but I learned, without realizing  
it at the time, a lot of valuable lessons about the software business.
In this case they were mostly negative lessons: don't have a lot
of meetings; don't have chunks of code that multiple people own;
don't have a sales guy running the company; don't make a high-end
product; don't let your code get too big; don't leave finding bugs
to QA people; don't go too long between releases; don't isolate
developers from users; don't move from Cambridge to Route 128; and
so on. [8] But negative lessons are just as valuable as positive 
ones.  Perhaps even more valuable: it's hard to repeat a brilliant
performance, but it's straightforward to avoid errors. [9]<br><br>The other reason it's hard to start a company before 23 is that     
people won't take you seriously.  VCs won't trust you, and will try
to reduce you to a mascot as a condition of funding.  Customers
will worry you're going to flake out and leave them stranded.  Even
you yourself, unless you're very unusual, will feel your age to     
some degree; you'll find it awkward to be the boss of someone much 
older than you, and if you're 21, hiring only people younger rather 
limits your options.<br><br>Some people could probably start a company at 18 if they wanted to.
Bill Gates was 19 when he and Paul Allen started Microsoft.  (Paul 
Allen was 22, though, and that probably made a difference.) So if
you're thinking, I don't care what he says, I'm going to start a
company now, you may be the sort of person who could get away with
it.<br><br>The other cutoff, 38, has a lot more play in it.  One reason I put 
it there is that I don't think many people have the physical stamina
much past that age.   I used to work till 2:00 or 3:00 AM every
night, seven days a week.  I don't know if I could do that now.<br><br>Also,
startups are a big risk financially.  If you try something that
blows up and leaves you broke at 26, big deal; a lot of 26 year
olds are broke.  By 38 you can't take so many risks-- especially
if you have kids.<br><br>My final test may be the most restrictive.  Do you actually want
to start a startup?  What it amounts to, economically, is compressing
your working life into the smallest possible space.  Instead of
working at an ordinary rate for 40 years, you work like hell for 
four.  And maybe end up with nothing-- though in that case it
probably won't take four years.<br><br>During this time you'll do little but work, because when you're not
working, your competitors will be.  My only leisure activities were
running, which I needed to do to keep working anyway, and about
fifteen minutes of reading a night.  I had a girlfriend for a total
of two months during that three year period.  Every couple weeks I
would take a few hours off to visit a used bookshop or go to a  
friend's house for dinner.  I went to visit my family twice.
Otherwise I just worked.<br><br>Working was often fun, because the people I worked with were some
of my best friends.  Sometimes it was even technically interesting.
But only about 10% of the time.  The best I can say for the other
90% is that some of it is funnier in hindsight than it seemed then.
Like the time the power went off in Cambridge for about six hours,
and we made the mistake of trying to start a gasoline powered
generator inside our offices. I won't try that again.<br><br>I don't think the amount of bullshit you have to deal with in a
startup is more than you'd endure in an ordinary working life.  It's
probably less, in fact; it just seems like a lot because it's       
compressed into a short period.  So mainly what a startup buys you 
is time.  That's the way to think about it if you're trying to 
decide whether to start one.  If you're the sort of person who would
like to solve the money problem once and for all instead of working 
for a salary for 40 years, then a startup makes sense.<br><br>For a lot of people the conflict is between startups and graduate
school.  Grad students are just the age, and just the sort of people,
to start software startups.  You may worry that if you do you'll   
blow your chances of an academic career.  But it's possible to be  
part of a startup and stay in grad school, especially at first.  
Two of our three original hackers were in grad school the whole 
time, and both got their <a href="tlbphd.html">degrees</a>. 
There are few sources of energy
so powerful as a procrastinating grad student.<br><br>If you do have to
leave grad school, in the worst case it won't be for too long.  If
a startup fails, it will probably fail quickly enough that you can 
return to academic life.  And if it succeeds, you may find you no   
longer have such a burning desire to be an assistant professor.<br><br>If you want to do it, do it.  Starting a startup is not the great
mystery it seems from outside.  It's not something you have to know
about "business" to do.  Build something users love, and spend less
than you make.  How hard is that?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] Google's revenues are about two billion a year, but half comes
from ads on other sites.<br><br>[2] One advantage startups have over established companies is that
there are no discrimination laws about starting businesses.  For   
example, I would be reluctant to start a startup with a woman
who had small children, or was likely to have them soon.  But you're
not allowed to ask prospective employees if they plan to have kids 
soon.  Believe it or not, under current US law, you're not even   
allowed to discriminate on the basis of intelligence.  Whereas when
you're starting a company, you can discriminate on any basis you
want about who you start it with.<br><br>[3] Learning to hack is a lot cheaper than business school, because
you can do it mostly on your own.  For the price of a Linux box, a
copy of K&amp;R, and a few hours of advice from your neighbor's fifteen
year old son, you'll be well on your way.<br><br>[4] Corollary: Avoid starting a startup to sell things to the biggest
company of all, the government.  Yes, there are lots of opportunities
to sell them technology.  But let someone else start those startups.<br><br>[5] A friend who started a company in Germany told me they do care 
about the paperwork there, and that there's more of it.  Which helps
explain why there are not more startups in Germany.<br><br>[6] At the seed stage our valuation was in principle $100,000, because
Julian got 10% of the company.  But this is a very misleading number,
because the money was the least important of the things Julian gave us.<br><br>[7] The same goes for companies that seem to want to acquire you.
There will be a few that are only pretending to in order to pick
your brains.  But you can never tell for sure which these are, so
the best approach is to seem entirely open, but to fail to mention
a few critical technical secrets.<br><br>[8]  I was as bad an employee as this place was a company.  I
apologize to anyone who had to work with me there.<br><br>[9]  You could probably write a book about how to succeed in business
by doing everything in exactly the opposite way from the DMV.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston,

interested in being a "technologist in residence" at a new venture
capital fund.  I think the idea was to play Karl Rove to the VCs'
George Bush.<br><br>I considered it for about four seconds.  Work for a VC fund?  Ick.<br><br>One of my most vivid memories from our startup is going to visit
Greylock, the famous Boston VCs. They were the most arrogant
people I've met in my life.  And I've met a lot of arrogant people.
[1]<br><br>I'm not alone in feeling this way, of course.  Even a VC friend of
mine dislikes VCs.  "Assholes," he says.<br><br>But lately I've been learning more about how the VC world works,
<!--(mostly in order to <a href="summerfounder.html">hack it</a>)-->
and a few days ago it hit me that there's a reason VCs are the way
they are.  It's not so much that the business attracts jerks, or
even that the power they wield corrupts them.  The real problem is
the way they're paid.<br><br>The problem with VC funds is that they're <i>funds</i>.  Like the
managers of mutual funds or hedge funds, VCs get paid a percentage
of the money they manage: about 2% a year in management fees,
plus a percentage of the gains.  So they want
the fund to be huge-- hundreds of millions of dollars, if possible.
But that means each partner ends up being responsible for investing
a lot of money.  And since one person can only manage so many deals,
each deal has to be for multiple millions of dollars.<br><br>This turns out to explain nearly all the characteristics of VCs
that founders hate.<br><br>It explains why VCs take so agonizingly long to make up their minds,
and why their due diligence feels like a body cavity search. [2]
With so much at stake, they have to be paranoid.<br><br>It explains why they steal your ideas.  Every founder knows that
VCs will tell your secrets to your competitors if they end up
investing in them.  It's not unheard of for VCs to meet you when
they have no intention of funding you, just to pick your brain for
a competitor.  This prospect makes naive founders clumsily secretive.
Experienced founders treat it as a cost of doing business.  Either
way it sucks.  But again, the only reason VCs are so sneaky is the
giant deals they do.  With so much at stake, they have to be devious.<br><br>It explains why VCs tend to interfere in the companies they invest
in.  They want to be on your board not just so that they can advise
you, but so that they can watch you.  Often they even install a new
CEO.  Yes, he may have extensive business experience.  But he's
also their man: these newly installed CEOs always play something  
of the role of a political commissar in a Red Army unit.  With
so much at stake, VCs can't resist micromanaging you.<br><br>The huge investments themselves are something founders would dislike,
if they realized how damaging they can be.  VCs don't invest $x
million because that's the amount you need, but because that's the
amount the structure of their business requires them to invest.  
Like steroids, these sudden huge investments can do more harm than 
good.  Google survived enormous VC funding because it could
legitimately absorb large amounts of money.  They had to buy a lot
of servers and a lot of bandwidth to crawl the whole Web.  Less
fortunate startups just end up hiring armies of people to sit around
having meetings.<br><br>In principle you could take a huge VC investment, put it in treasury
bills, and continue to operate frugally.  You just try it.<br><br>And of course giant investments mean giant valuations.  They have
to, or there's not enough stock left to keep the founders interested.
You might think a high valuation is a great thing.  Many founders 
do.  But you can't eat paper.  You can't benefit from a high valuation
unless you can somehow achieve what those in the business 
<!-- (with no apparent embarrassment)-->
call a "liquidity event," and the higher   
your valuation, the narrower your options for doing that.  Many a   
founder would be happy to sell his company for $15 million, but VCs
who've just invested at a pre-money valuation of $8 million won't
hear of that.  You're rolling the dice again, whether you like it
or not.<br><br>Back in 1997, one of our competitors raised $20 million in a single 
round of VC funding.  This was at the time more than the valuation
of our entire company.  Was I worried?  Not at all: I was delighted.
It was like watching a car you're chasing turn down a street that
you know has no outlet.<br><br>Their smartest move at that point would have been to take every 
penny of the $20 million and use it to buy us.  We would have sold.
Their investors would have been furious of course.  But I think the  
main reason they never considered this was that they never imagined
we could be had so cheap.  They probably assumed we were on the
same VC gravy train they were.<br><br>In fact we only spent about $2 million in our entire existence.   
And that gave us flexibility.  We could sell ourselves to Yahoo for
$50 million, and everyone was delighted.  If our competitor had
done that, the last round of investors would presumably have lost
money.  I assume they could have vetoed such a deal.  But no one  
those days was paying a lot more than Yahoo.  So unless their
founders could pull off an IPO (which would be difficult with Yahoo
as a competitor), they had no choice but to ride the thing down.<br><br>The puffed-up companies that went public during the Bubble didn't
do it just because they were pulled into it by unscrupulous investment 
bankers.  Most were pushed just as hard from the other side by VCs
who'd invested at high valuations, leaving an IPO as the only way  
out.  The only people dumber were retail investors.  So it was
literally IPO or bust.  Or rather, IPO then bust, or just bust.<br><br>Add up all the evidence of VCs' behavior, and the resulting personality
is not attractive.  In fact, it's the classic villain: alternately
cowardly, greedy, sneaky, and overbearing.<br><br>I used to take it for granted that VCs were like this. Complaining  
that VCs were jerks used to seem as naive to me as complaining that
users didn't read the reference manual.  Of course VCs were jerks.
How could it be otherwise?<br><br>But I realize now that they're not intrinsically jerks.  VCs are  
like car salesmen or bureaucrats: the nature of their work
turns them into jerks.<br><br>I've met a few VCs I like.  Mike Moritz seems a good guy.  He even 
has a sense of humor, which is almost unheard of among VCs.  From  
what I've read about John Doerr, he sounds like a good guy too,  
almost a hacker.  But they work for the very best VC funds.  And 
my theory explains why they'd tend to be different: just as the
very most popular kids don't have to persecute 
<a href="nerds.html">nerds</a>, the very best
VCs don't have to act like VCs.  They get the pick of all the best  
deals.  So they don't have to be so paranoid and sneaky, and they 
can choose those rare companies, like Google, that will actually
benefit from the giant sums they're compelled to invest.<br><br>VCs often complain that in their business there's too much money
chasing too few deals.  Few realize that this also describes a flaw
in the way funding works at the level of individual firms.<br><br>Perhaps this was the sort of strategic insight I was supposed to   
come up with as a "technologist in residence."  If so, the good
news is that they're getting it for free.  The bad news is it
means that if you're not one of the very top funds, you're 
condemned to be the bad guys.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] After Greylock booted founder Philip Greenspun out of ArsDigita,
he wrote a hilarious but also very informative
<a href="http://www.waxy.org/random/arsdigita/">essay</a> about it.
<!-- comparing 
the resulting situation to a bunch of
kids sitting in the cockpit of a 747, flipping switches
and wondering how to make the thing take off.  He later took this off the
Web, but I happen to remember this choice metaphor.--><br><br>[2] Since most VCs aren't tech guys, the technology side of their
due diligence tends to be like a body cavity search by someone with
a faulty knowledge of human anatomy.  After a while we were quite
sore from VCs attempting to probe our nonexistent database orifice.<br><br>No, we don't use Oracle.  We just store the data in files.  Our
secret is to use an OS that doesn't lose our data.  Which OS?
FreeBSD.  Why do you use that instead of Windows NT?  Because it's
better and it doesn't cost anything.  What, you're using a
<i>freeware</i> OS?<br><br>How many times that conversation was repeated.
Then when we got to Yahoo, we found they used FreeBSD and stored
their data in files too.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://flyingapplet.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!F682AFBD82F7E261!374.entry">Chinese Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/lionfan/20070214">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

March 2005<br><br><i>(Parts of this essay began as replies to students who wrote to
me with questions.)</i><br><br>Recently I've had several emails from computer science
undergrads asking what to do in college. I might not
be the best source of advice, because I was a philosophy major in
college.  But I took so many CS classes that most CS majors thought
I was one.  I was certainly a hacker, at least.<br><br><b>Hacking</b><br><br>What should you do in college to become a 
<a href="gh.html">good hacker</a>?  There are two
main things you can do: become very good at programming, and learn
a lot about specific, cool problems.  These turn out to be equivalent,
because each drives you to do the other.<br><br>The way to be good at programming is to work (a) a lot (b) on hard
problems.  And the way to make yourself work on hard problems is
to work on some very engaging project.<br><br><!-- The first
derivative of "imagination is more important than knowledge" is
"curiosity is more important than discipline." [1] Nothing will
make you smarter faster than an engaging project.
-->
Odds are this project won't be a class assignment.  My friend Robert
learned a lot by writing network software when he was an
undergrad. One of his projects was to connect Harvard to the
Arpanet; it had been one of the original nodes, but by 1984 the
connection had died. [1]  Not only was this
work not for a class, but because he spent all his time on it
and neglected his studies, he was kicked out of
school for a year. [2]  It all evened out in the end, and now he's
a professor at MIT.  But you'll probably be happier if you don't
go to that extreme; it caused him a lot of worry at the time.<br><br>Another way to be good at programming is to find other people who
are good at it, and learn what they know.  Programmers tend to sort
themselves into tribes according to the type of work they do and
the tools they use, and some tribes are 
<a href="pypar.html">smarter</a> than others.  Look
around you and see what the smart people seem to be working on;
there's usually a reason.<br><br>Some of the smartest people around you are professors.  So one way
to find interesting work is to volunteer as a research assistant.
Professors are especially interested in people who can solve tedious
system-administration type problems for them, so that is a way to
get a foot in the door.  What they fear are
flakes and resume padders.  It's all too
common for an assistant to result in a net increase in work.  So
you have to make it clear you'll mean a net decrease.<br><br>Don't be put off if they say no.  Rejection is almost always less
personal than the rejectee imagines.  Just move on to the next.
(This applies to dating too.)<br><br>Beware, because although most professors are smart, not all of them
work on interesting stuff.  Professors have to publish novel results
to advance their careers, but there is more competition in more
interesting areas of research.  So what less ambitious professors
do is turn out a series of papers whose conclusions are novel because
no one else cares about them.  You're better off avoiding these.<br><br>I never worked as a research assistant, so I feel a bit dishonest
recommending that route.  I learned to program by writing stuff of
my own, particularly by trying to reverse-engineer Winograd's
SHRDLU.  I was as obsessed with that program as a mother with a new baby.<br><br>Whatever the disadvantages of working by yourself, the advantage
is that the project is all your own.  You never have to compromise
or ask anyone's permission, and if you have a new idea you can just
sit down and start implementing it.<br><br>In your own projects you don't have to worry about novelty (as
professors do) or profitability (as businesses do).  All that matters
is how hard the project is technically, and that has no correlation
to the nature of the application.  "Serious" applications like   
databases are often trivial and dull technically (if you ever suffer
from insomnia, try reading the technical literature about databases)
while "frivolous" applications like games are often very sophisticated.
I'm sure there are game companies out there working on products
with more intellectual content than the research at the
bottom nine tenths of university CS departments.<br><br>If I were in college now I'd probably work on
graphics: a network game, for example, or a tool for 3D animation.
When I was an undergrad there weren't enough cycles around to make
graphics interesting, but it's hard to imagine anything more fun
to work on now.<br><br><b>Math</b><br><br>When I was in college, a lot of the professors believed (or at least
wished) that 
<a href="hp.html">computer science</a> was a branch of math.  This idea was
strongest at Harvard, where there wasn't even a CS major till the
1980s; till then one had to major in applied math.  But it was
nearly as bad at Cornell.  When I told the fearsome Professor Conway
that I was interested in AI (a hot topic then), he told me I should
major in math.  I'm still not sure whether he thought AI required
math, or whether he thought AI was nonsense and that majoring in
something rigorous would cure me of such stupid ambitions.<br><br>In fact, the amount of math you need as a hacker is a lot less   
than most university departments like to admit.  I don't think you  
need much more than high school math plus a few concepts from the
theory of computation.  (You have to know what an n^2 algorithm is
if you want to avoid writing them.) Unless you're planning to write
math applications, of course.  Robotics, for example, is all math.<br><br>But while you don't literally need math for most kinds of hacking,
in the sense of knowing 1001 tricks for differentiating formulas, 
math is very much worth studying for its own sake.  It's a 
valuable source of metaphors for almost any kind of work.[3] I wish 
I'd studied more math in college for that reason.<br><br>Like a lot of people, I was mathematically abused as a child.  I   
learned to think of math as a collection of formulas that were
neither beautiful nor had any relation to my life (despite attempts
to translate them into "word problems"), but had to be memorized 
in order to do well on tests.<br><br>One of the most valuable things you could do in college would be
to learn what math is really about.  This may not be easy, because
a lot of good mathematicians are bad teachers.  And while there are
many popular books on math, few seem good.  The best I can think
of are W. W. Sawyer's.  And of course Euclid. [4]<br><br><b>Everything</b><br><br>Thomas Huxley said "Try to learn something about everything and 
everything about something."  Most universities aim at this
ideal.<br><br>But what's everything?  To me it means, all that people
learn in the course of working honestly on hard problems.  All such 
work tends to be related, in that ideas and techniques from one   
field can often be transplanted successfully to others.  Even others
that seem quite distant.  For example, I write 
<a href="essay.html">essays</a> the same way
I write software: I sit down and blow out a lame version 1 as fast
as I can type, then spend several weeks rewriting it.<br><br>Working on hard problems is not, by itself, enough.  Medieval   
alchemists were working on a hard problem, but their approach was 
so bogus that there was little
to learn from studying it, except possibly about people's ability  
to delude themselves.  Unfortunately the sort of AI I was trying    
to learn in college had the same flaw: a very hard problem, blithely
approached with hopelessly inadequate techniques.  Bold?  Closer 
to fraudulent.
<!--
There is a good deal of such bogusness around.  For example, the
field of literary theory is almost entirely bogus.  They seem to 
be writing about hard questions, at least some of the time, but
standards in the field are so low that one need not say anything 
interesting, so long as one says it in a sufficiently complicated 
way. [6]<br /><br />I'm not saying that literature is bogus, by the way, just that the
way to study it is the way its practitioners do.  Novelists work  
honestly on hard problems.  Indeed, it's precisely because this    
work is so hard that literary theory happens.   Most literary
theorists would be writers if they could, just as most art critics
would be artists. --><br><br>The social sciences are also fairly bogus, because they're so much 
influenced by intellectual <a href="say.html">fashions</a>.  If a 
physicist met a colleague
from 100 years ago, he could teach him some new things; if a psychologist
met a colleague from 100 years ago, they'd just get into an
ideological argument.
Yes, of course, you'll learn something by taking a
psychology class.  The point is, you'll learn more by taking
a class in another department.<br><br>The worthwhile departments, in my opinion, are math, the hard
sciences, engineering, history (especially economic and social  
history, and the history of science), architecture, and the classics.
A survey course in art history may be worthwhile.  Modern literature
is important, but the way to learn about it is just to read.  I
don't know enough about music to say.<br><br>You can skip the social sciences, philosophy, and the various
departments created recently in response to political pressures.
Many of these fields talk about important problems, certainly.  But
the way they talk about them is useless.  For example, philosophy   
talks, among other things, about our obligations to one another;    
but you can learn more about this from a wise grandmother or E. B.
White than from an academic philosopher.<br><br>I speak here from experience.  I should probably have been offended 
when people laughed at Clinton for saying "It depends on what the  
meaning of the word 'is' is."  I took about five classes in college
on what the meaning of "is" is.<br><br>Another way to figure out which fields are worth studying is to  
create the <i> dropout graph.</i> For example, I know many people  
who switched from math to computer science because they found math  
too hard, and no one who did the opposite.  People don't do hard
things gratuitously; no one will work on a harder problem unless  
it is proportionately (or at least log(n)) more rewarding.  So
probably math is more worth studying than computer science.  By
similar comparisons you can make a graph of all the departments in
a university.  At the bottom you'll find the subjects with least 
intellectual content.<br><br>If you use this method, you'll get roughly the same answer I just 
gave.<br><br>Language courses are an anomaly.  I think they're better considered
as extracurricular activities, like pottery classes.  They'd be far
more useful when combined with some time living in a country where 
the language is spoken.  On a whim I studied Arabic as a freshman.
It was a lot of work, and the only lasting benefits were a weird  
ability to identify semitic roots and some insights into how people
recognize words.<br><br>Studio art and creative writing courses are wildcards.  Usually 
you don't get taught much:  you just work (or don't work) on whatever
you want, and then sit around offering "crits" of one another's
creations under the vague supervision of the teacher.  But writing and
art are both very hard problems that (some) people work honestly
at, so they're worth doing, especially if you can find a good
teacher.<br><br><b>Jobs</b><br><br>Of course college students have to think about more than just
learning.  There are also two practical problems to consider: jobs,
and graduate school.<br><br>In theory a liberal education is not supposed to supply job training.
But everyone knows this is a bit of a fib.  Hackers at every college
learn practical skills, and not by accident.<br><br>What you should learn to get a job depends on the kind you want.
If you want to work in a big company, learn how to hack 
<a href="avg.html">Blub</a> on
Windows.  If you want to work at a cool little company or research  
lab, you'll do better to learn Ruby on Linux.  And if you want to  
start your own company, which I think will be more and more common,
master the most powerful tools you can find, because you're going
to be in a race against your competitors, and they'll be your horse.<br><br>There is not a direct correlation between the skills you should    
learn in college and those you'll use in a job.  You should aim     
slightly high in college.<br><br>In workouts a football player may bench press 300 pounds, even
though he may never have to exert anything like that much force in
the course of a game.  Likewise, if your professors try to make you
learn stuff that's more advanced than you'll need in a job, it may
not just be because they're academics, detached from the real world.
They may be trying to make you lift weights with your brain.<br><br>The programs you write in classes differ in three critical ways
from the ones you'll write in the real world: they're small; you
get to start from scratch; and the problem is usually artificial   
and predetermined.  In the real world, programs are bigger, tend   
to involve existing code, and often require you to figure out what 
the problem is before you can solve it.<br><br>You don't have to wait to leave (or even enter) college to learn   
these skills.  If you want to learn how to deal with existing code,
for example, you can contribute to open-source projects.  The sort
of employer you want to work for will be as impressed by that as 
good grades on class assignments.<br><br>In existing open-source projects you don't get much practice at
the third skill, deciding what problems to solve.  But there's 
nothing to stop you starting new projects of your own.  And  good
employers will be even more impressed
with that.<br><br>What sort of problem should you try to solve?  One way to answer
that is to ask what you need as a user.  For example, I stumbled
on a good algorithm for spam filtering because I wanted to stop  
getting spam.  Now what I wish I had was a mail reader that somehow
prevented my inbox from filling up.  I tend to use my inbox as a
todo list.  But that's like using a screwdriver to open
bottles; what one really wants is a bottle opener.<br><br><b>Grad School</b><br><br>What about grad school?  Should you go?  And how do you get into a  
good one?<br><br>In principle, grad school is professional training in research, and
you shouldn't go unless you want to do research as a career.  And   
yet half the people who get PhDs in CS don't go into research.
I didn't go to grad school to become a professor.  I went because   
I wanted to learn more.<br><br>So if you're mainly interested in hacking and you go to grad school,
you'll find a lot of other people who are similarly out of their  
element.  And if half the people around you are out of their element in the
same way you are, are you really out of your element?<br><br>There's a fundamental problem in "computer science," and it surfaces
in situations like this.  No one is sure what "research" is supposed to be.  
A lot
of research is hacking that had to be crammed into the form of an
academic paper to yield one more quantum of publication.<br><br>So it's kind of misleading to ask whether you'll be at home in grad
school, because very few people are quite at home in computer
science.  The whole field is uncomfortable in its own skin.  So
the fact that you're mainly interested in hacking shouldn't deter  
you from going to grad school.  Just be warned you'll have to do a lot of stuff   
you don't like.<br><br>Number one will be your dissertation.  Almost everyone hates their
dissertation by the time they're done with it.  The
process inherently tends to produce an unpleasant result, like a cake made out
of whole wheat flour and baked for twelve hours.  Few dissertations 
are read with pleasure, especially by their authors.<br><br>But thousands before you have suffered through writing a dissertation.
And aside from that, grad school is close to paradise.  Many people
remember it as the happiest time of their lives.  And nearly all
the rest, including me, remember it as a period that would have 
been, if they hadn't had to write a dissertation. [5]<br><br>The danger with grad school is that you don't see the scary part
upfront.  PhD programs start out as college part 2, with several
years of classes.  So by the time you face the horror of writing a  
dissertation, you're already several years in.  If you quit now,
you'll be a grad-school dropout, and you probably won't like that
idea.  When Robert got kicked out of grad school for writing the
Internet worm of 1988, I envied him enormously for finding a way out
without the stigma of failure. <!-- And he was unhappy that Cornell
expelled him, the ingrate.--><br><br>On the whole, grad school is probably better than most alternatives.  You meet a 
lot of smart people, and your glum procrastination will at least    
be a powerful common bond.  And of course you have a PhD at the
end.  I forgot about that. I suppose that's worth something.<br><br>The greatest advantage of a PhD (besides being the union card of
academia, of course) may be that it gives you some baseline confidence.
For example, the Honeywell thermostats in my house have the most
atrocious UI.  My mother, who has the same model, diligently spent
a day reading the user's manual to learn how to operate hers.  She
assumed the problem was with her.  But I can think to myself "If
someone with a PhD in computer science can't understand this
thermostat, it <i>must</i> be badly 
designed."<br><br>If you still want to go to grad school after this equivocal
recommendation, I can give you solid advice about how to get in. 
A lot of my friends are CS professors now, so I have the inside
story about admissions.  It's quite different from college.  At
most colleges, admissions officers decide who gets in.  For PhD
programs, the professors do.  And they try to do
it well, because the people they admit are going to be working for
them.<br><br>Apparently only recommendations really matter at the best schools.
Standardized tests count for nothing, and grades for little.  The
essay is mostly an opportunity to disqualify yourself by saying   
something stupid.  The only thing professors
trust is recommendations, preferably from people they know. [6]<br><br>So if you want to get into a PhD program, the key is to impress
your professors.  And from my friends who are professors I know 
what impresses them: not merely trying to impress them.  They're
not impressed by students who get good grades or want to be their
research assistants so they can get into grad school.  They're
impressed by students who get good grades and want to be their  
research assistants because they're genuinely interested in the 
topic.<br><br>So the best thing you can do in college, whether you want to get
into grad school or just be good at hacking, is figure out what you
truly like.  It's hard to trick professors into letting you into
grad school, and impossible to trick problems into letting you solve
them.  College is where faking stops working.  From this point,
unless you want to go work for a big company, which is like reverting
to high school, the only way forward is through doing what you 
<a href="love.html">love</a>.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br><!-- [1] When I was in college a lot of people had posters of Einstein
with "imagination is more important than knowledge" printed on them.
I think for many it was wishful thinking; it seemed to mean one
didn't have to study.  In fact what Einstein probably meant was:
knowledge is enormously important, but of two people who both have
great knowledge, the one with more imagination will do better.  That
doesn't make as good a quote, though.
-->
[1] No one seems to have minded, which shows how unimportant
the Arpanet (which became the Internet) was as late as
1984.<br><br>[2] This is why, when I became an employer, I didn't care
about GPAs.  In fact, we actively sought out people   
who'd failed out of school.  We once put up posters around Harvard
saying "Did you just get kicked out for doing badly in your classes
because you spent all your time working on some project of your   
own?  Come work for us!"  We managed to find a kid who had been, 
and he was a great hacker.<br><br>When Harvard kicks undergrads out for a year, they have to get jobs.
The idea is to show them how awful the real world is, so they'll    
understand how lucky they are to be in college.  This plan backfired
with the guy who came to work for us, because he had more fun than
he'd had in school, and made more that year from stock options than
any of his professors did in salary.  So instead of crawling back
repentant at the end of the year, he took another year off and went
to Europe.  He did eventually graduate at about 26.<br><br>[3] Eric Raymond says the best metaphors for hackers are
in set theory, combinatorics, and graph theory.<br><br>Trevor Blackwell reminds you to take math classes intended for math majors.
"'Math for engineers' classes sucked mightily. In fact any 'x for
engineers' sucks, where x includes math, law, writing and visual
design."<br><br>[4] Other highly recommended books: <i>What is Mathematics?</i>, by
Courant and Robbins;  <i>Geometry and the Imagination</i> by Hilbert and 
Cohn-Vossen.
And for those interested in graphic design,
<a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/people/faculty/cass/Euclid/byrne.html">Byrne's Euclid</a>.<br><br><!-- [6] You can't get any lower than publishing placebos, as happened
in the Sokal Affair.
-->
[5] If you wanted to have the perfect life, the thing to do would
be to go to grad school, secretly write your dissertation in the
first year or two, and then just enjoy yourself for the next three
years, dribbling out a chapter at a time.  This prospect will make
grad students' mouths water, but I know of no one who's had the
discipline to pull it off.<br><br>[6] One professor friend says that 15-20% of the grad students they
admit each year are "long shots."  But what he means by long shots
are people whose applications are perfect in every way, except
that no one on the admissions committee knows the professors who
wrote the recommendations.<br><br>So if you want to get into
grad school in the sciences, you need to go to college somewhere with
real research professors.  Otherwise you'll seem a risky bet
to admissions committees, no matter how good you are.<br><br>Which implies
a surprising but apparently inevitable consequence:
little liberal arts colleges are doomed.
<!--, except those few that
make a conscious effort to
excel in the sciences.--> Most smart
high school kids at least consider going into the sciences, even
if they ultimately choose not to.
Why go to a college that limits their options?<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Alex Lewin, Jessica Livingston,

essays that were short and didn't mention Lisp.)</i>
-->
<i>(In the process
of answering an email, I accidentally wrote a tiny essay about writing.
I usually spend weeks on an essay.  This one took <!--44--> 67 minutes—23
of writing, and <!--21--> 44 of rewriting.)</i><br><br>I think it's far more important to write well than most people
realize.  Writing doesn't just communicate ideas; it generates them.
If you're bad at writing and don't like to do it, you'll miss out
on most of the ideas writing would have generated.<br><br>As for how to write well, here's the short version: 
Write a bad version
1 as fast as you can; rewrite it over and over; cut <s>out</s> everything
unnecessary; write in a conversational tone; develop a nose for
bad writing, so you can see and fix it in yours; imitate writers
you like; if you can't get started, tell someone what you plan to
write about, then write down what you said; expect
80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it,
and 50% of those you start with to be wrong; be confident enough
to cut; have friends you trust read your stuff and tell you which
bits are confusing or drag; don't (always) make detailed outlines;
mull ideas over for a few days before
writing; carry a small notebook or scrap paper with you; start writing 
when you think of the first 
sentence; if a deadline
forces you to start before that, just say the most important sentence
first; write about stuff you like; don't try to sound impressive; don't hesitate to change the topic on the fly;
use footnotes to contain digressions; use anaphora to knit
sentences together; read your essays out loud to see (a) where you stumble
over awkward phrases and (b) which bits are boring (the
paragraphs you dread reading); try to tell the
reader something new and useful; work in fairly big quanta of time;
when you restart, begin by rereading what you have so far; when you
finish, leave yourself something easy to start with; accumulate
notes for topics you plan to cover at the bottom of the file; don't
feel obliged to cover any of them; write for a reader who won't
read the essay as carefully as you do, just as pop songs are
designed to sound ok on crappy car radios; <!-- read
writers you like, and try to figure out what makes you like them;-->
if you say anything mistaken, fix it immediately;
ask friends which sentence you'll regret most; go back and tone
down harsh remarks; publish stuff online, because
an audience makes you write more, and thus generate more
ideas; print out drafts instead of just looking at them
on the screen; use simple, germanic words; learn to distinguish
surprises from digressions; learn to recognize the approach of an
ending, and when one appears, grab it.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5"

I know are gradually switching to Macs.  My
friend Robert said his whole research group at MIT recently bought
themselves Powerbooks.  These guys are not the graphic designers
and grandmas who were buying Macs at Apple's low point in the
mid 1990s.  They're about as hardcore OS hackers as you can get.<br><br>The reason, of course, is OS X.  Powerbooks are beautifully designed
and run FreeBSD.  What more do you need to know?<br><br>I got a Powerbook at the end of last year.   When my IBM Thinkpad's
hard disk died soon after, it became my only laptop.  And when my
friend Trevor showed up at my house recently, he was carrying a
Powerbook <a href="tlbmac.html">identical</a> to mine.<br><br>For most of us, it's not a switch to Apple, but a return.  Hard as
this was to believe in the mid 90s, the Mac was in its time the
canonical hacker's computer.<br><br>In the fall of 1983,
the professor in one of my college CS classes got up and announced,
like a prophet, that there would soon be a computer with half a MIPS
of processing power that would fit under an airline seat and cost
so little that we could save enough to buy one from a summer job.
The whole room gasped.
And when the Mac appeared, it was even better than we'd hoped.  It
was small and powerful and cheap, as promised.  But it was also
something we'd never considered a computer could be: fabulously
well <a href="taste.html">designed</a>.<br><br>I had to have one.  And I wasn't alone.  In the mid to late 1980s,
all the hackers I knew were either writing software for the Mac,
or wanted to.  Every futon sofa in Cambridge seemed to have the
same fat white book lying open on it.  If you turned it over, it
said "Inside Macintosh." <!-- in Apple Garamond. --><br><br>Then came Linux and FreeBSD, and hackers, who follow the most
powerful OS wherever it leads, found themselves switching to Intel
boxes.  If you cared about design, you could buy a Thinkpad, which
was at least not actively repellent, if you could get the Intel and
Microsoft <a href="designedforwindows.html">stickers</a> 
off the front. [1]<br><br>With OS X, the hackers are back.  When I walked into the Apple store
in Cambridge, it was like coming home.  Much
was changed, but there was still that Apple coolness in the air,
that feeling that the show was being run by someone who really
cared, instead of random corporate deal-makers.<br><br>So what, the business world may say. Who cares if hackers like Apple
again?  How big is the hacker market, after all?<br><br>Quite small, but important out of proportion to its size.  When it
comes to computers, what hackers are doing now, everyone will be
doing in ten years.  Almost all technology, from Unix to bitmapped
displays to the Web, became popular first within CS departments and
research labs, and gradually spread to the rest of the world.<br><br>I remember telling my father back in 1986 that there was a new kind
of computer called a Sun that was a serious Unix machine, but
so small and cheap that you could
have one of your own to sit in front of, instead of sitting in front
of a VT100 connected to a single central Vax.  Maybe, I suggested,
he should buy some stock in this company.  I think he really wishes
he'd listened.<br><br>In 1994 my friend Koling wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan,
and to save long-distance bills he wrote some software that would  
convert sound to data packets that could be sent over the Internet.
We weren't sure at the time whether this was a proper use of the 
Internet, which was still then a quasi-government entity.  What he
was doing is now called VoIP, and it is a huge and rapidly growing
business.<br><br>If you want to know what ordinary people will be doing with computers
in ten years, just walk around the CS department at a good university.
Whatever they're doing, you'll be doing.<br><br>In the matter of "platforms" this tendency is even more pronounced,
because novel software originates with 
<a href="gh.html">great hackers</a>, and they tend
to write it first for whatever computer they personally use.  And
software sells hardware.  Many if not most of the initial sales of
the Apple II came from people who bought one to run VisiCalc.  And
why did Bricklin and Frankston write VisiCalc for the Apple II?
Because they personally liked it.  They could have chosen any machine
to make into a star.<br><br>If you want to attract hackers to write software that will sell
your hardware, you have to make it something that they themselves
use.  It's not enough to make it "open."  It has to be open and
good.<br><br>And open and good is what Macs are again, finally.  The intervening
years have created a situation that is, as far as I know, without
precedent: Apple is popular at the low end and the high end, but
not in the middle.  My seventy year old mother has a Mac laptop.
My friends with PhDs in computer science have Mac laptops. [2] And yet 
Apple's overall market share is still small.<br><br>Though unprecedented, I predict this situation is also temporary.<br><br>So Dad, there's this company called Apple. They make a new kind of
computer that's as well designed as a Bang &amp; Olufsen stereo system,
and underneath is the best Unix machine you can buy.  Yes, the price
to earnings ratio is kind of high, but I think a lot of people are
going to want these.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] These horrible stickers are much like the intrusive ads popular
on pre-Google search engines.  They say to the customer: you are
unimportant.  We care about Intel and Microsoft, not you.<br><br>[2] <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>
is (we hope) visited mostly by
hackers.  The proportions of OSes are: 
Windows 66.4%, Macintosh 18.8%, Linux 11.4%, and FreeBSD 1.5%.
The Mac number is
a big change from what it would have been five years ago.<br><br><!--[These numbers are revised.  The original numbers overstated FreeBSD's

<p>
April 2005<br><br>This summer, as an 
experiment, some 
friends and I are giving <a href="http://ycombinator.com">seed
funding</a> to a bunch of new startups.  It's an experiment because
we're prepared to fund younger founders than most investors would.
That's why we're doing it during the summer—so even college
students can participate.<br><br>We know from Google and Yahoo that grad students can start successful
startups.  And we know from experience that some undergrads are as
capable as most grad students.  The accepted age for startup founders
has been creeping downward. We're trying to find the lower bound.<br><br><!-- There have been cases, certainly, of startups founded by people
still in their teens.  But I suspect few of them were allowed
by investors to be more than mascots.<br /><br />That's not how we plan to operate.  Having done it once, we have
no desire to experience again the 24/7 timesuck of running even one
startup, let alone eight or ten.  We'll give these guys as much
help as we can with their ideas, but it will be up to them to sink
or swim.
-->
The deadline has now passed, and we're sifting through 227 applications.
<!--We've learned a few surprising things in the process.
One pleasant surprise is how few cranks we got.  We expected to
attract flocks of them, but we've only had a handful.  We were
surprised, too, at how smart the applicants appear to be.  And how
extraordinarily energetic.  But you know what the most surprising
thing is?  How bad some of the smartest applicants' ideas are.-->
We expected to divide them into two categories, promising
and unpromising.  But we soon saw we needed a third: promising
people with unpromising ideas.
<font color="#777777">[<a name="f1" href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>The Artix Phase</b><br><br>We should have expected this.  It's very common for a group of
founders to go through one lame idea before realizing that a startup
has to make something people will pay for.   In fact, we ourselves
did.<br><br>Viaweb wasn't the first startup Robert Morris and I started.  In
January 1995, we and a couple friends started a company called
Artix.  The plan was to put art galleries on the Web.  In retrospect,
I wonder how we could have wasted our time on anything so stupid.
Galleries are not especially <a href="http://www.knoedlergallery.com/">excited</a> about being on
the Web even now, ten years later.  They don't want to have their
stock visible to any random visitor, like an antique store. 
<font color="#777777">[<a name="f2" href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Besides which, art dealers are the most technophobic people on
earth.  They didn't become art dealers after a difficult choice
between that and a career in the hard sciences.  Most of them had
never seen the Web before we came to tell them why they should be
on it.  Some didn't even have computers.  It doesn't do justice to
the situation to describe it as a hard <i>sell</i>; we soon sank
to building sites for free, and it was hard to convince galleries
even to do that.<br><br>Gradually it dawned on us that 
instead of trying to make Web sites for
people who didn't want them, we could make sites for
people who did.  In fact, software that would let people who wanted
sites make their own.  So we ditched Artix and
started a new company, Viaweb, to make software for building online stores.
That one succeeded.<br><br>We're in good company here.  Microsoft was not the first company
Paul Allen and Bill Gates started either.  The first was called
Traf-o-data.  <!-- I don't know exactly what happened to Traf-o-data,  
but i-->It does not seem to have done as well as Micro-soft.
<!-- , as Microsoft was called then.--><br><br>In Robert's defense, he was skeptical about Artix.  I dragged him
into it. 
<font color="#777777">[<a name="f3" href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
But there were moments when he was optimistic.  And
if we, who were 29 and 30 at the time, could get excited about such
a thoroughly boneheaded idea, we should not be surprised that hackers
aged 21 or 22 are pitching us ideas with little hope of making money.<br><br><b>The Still Life Effect</b><br><br>Why does this happen?  Why do good hackers have bad business ideas?<br><br>Let's look at our case.  One reason we had such a lame idea was
that it was the first thing we thought of.  I was in New York trying
to be a starving artist at the time (the starving part is actually
quite easy), so I was haunting galleries anyway.  When I learned
about the Web, it seemed natural to mix the two.  Make Web sites
for galleries—that's the ticket!<br><br>If you're going to spend years working on something, you'd think
it might be wise to spend at least a couple days considering different
ideas, instead of going with the first that comes into your head.
You'd think.  But people don't.  In fact, this is a constant problem
when you're painting still lifes.  You plonk down a bunch of stuff
on a table, and maybe spend five or ten minutes rearranging it to 
look interesting.  But you're so impatient to get started painting
that ten minutes of rearranging feels very long.  So you start
painting.  Three days later, having spent twenty hours staring at
it, you're kicking yourself for having set up such an awkward and   
boring composition, but by then it's too late.<br><br>Part of the problem is that big projects tend to grow out of small
ones.  You set up a still life to make a quick sketch when you have
a spare hour, and days later you're still working on it.  I once
spent a month painting three versions of a still life I set up in
about four minutes.  At each point (a day, a week, a month) I thought
I'd already put in so much time that it was too late to change.<br><br>So the biggest cause of bad ideas is the still life effect:  you 
come up with a random idea, plunge into it, and then at each point
(a day, a week, a month) feel you've put so much time into it that
this must be <i>the</i> idea.<br><br>How do we fix that?  I don't think we should discard plunging.   
Plunging into an idea is a good thing.  The solution is at the other
end: to realize that having invested time in something doesn't make
it good.<br><br>This is clearest in the case of names.  Viaweb was originally
called Webgen, but we discovered someone else had a product called
that.  We were so attached to our name that we offered him <i>5%
of the company</i> if he'd let us have it.   But he wouldn't, so
we had to think of another.  
<font color="#777777">[<a name="f4" href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font>
The best we could do was Viaweb,
which we disliked at first.  It was like having a new mother.  But 
within three days we loved it, and Webgen sounded lame and
old-fashioned.<br><br>If it's hard to change something so simple as a name, imagine
how hard it is to garbage-collect an idea.  A name only has one 
point of attachment into your head.  An idea for a company gets
woven into your thoughts.  So you must consciously discount for   
that.  Plunge in, by all means, but remember later to look at your   
idea in the harsh light of morning and ask: is this something people
will pay for?  Is this, of all the things we could make, the thing
people will pay most for?<br><br><b>Muck</b><br><br>The second mistake we made with Artix is also very common.  Putting
galleries on the Web seemed cool.<br><br>One of the most valuable things my father taught me is an old
Yorkshire saying: where there's muck, there's brass.  Meaning that 
unpleasant work pays.  And more to the point here, vice versa.  Work
people like doesn't pay well, for reasons of supply and demand.
The most extreme case is developing programming languages, which
doesn't pay at all, because people like it so much they do it for 
free.<br><br>When we started Artix, I was still ambivalent about business.  I
wanted to keep one foot in the art world.  Big, big, mistake.  Going
into business is like a hang-glider launch: you'd better do it 
wholeheartedly, or not at all.  The purpose of a company, and a
startup especially, is to make money.  You can't have divided
loyalties.<br><br>Which is not to say that you have to do the most disgusting sort  
of work, like spamming, or starting a company whose only purpose  
is patent litigation.  What I mean is, if you're starting a company
that will do something cool, the aim had better be to make money 
and maybe be cool, not to be cool and maybe make money.<br><br>It's hard enough to make money that you can't do it by accident.
Unless it's your first priority, it's unlikely to happen at all.<br><br><b>Hyenas</b><br><br>When I probe our motives with Artix, I see a third mistake: timidity.
If you'd proposed at the time that we go into the e-commerce business,
we'd have found the idea terrifying.  Surely a field like that would
be dominated by fearsome startups with five million dollars of VC
money each.  Whereas we felt pretty sure that we could hold our own
in the slightly less competitive business of generating Web sites 
for art galleries.<br><br>We erred ridiculously far on the side of safety.  As it turns out,
VC-backed startups are not that fearsome.  They're too busy trying
to spend all that 
<a href="venturecapital.html">money</a> to get software written.  In 1995, the
e-commerce business was very competitive as measured in press
releases, but not as measured in software.  And really it never
was.  The big fish like Open Market (rest their souls) were just
consulting companies pretending to be product companies 
<font color="#777777">[<a name="f5" href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font>, and  
the offerings at our end of the market were a couple hundred lines
of Perl scripts.  Or could have been implemented as a couple hundred
lines of Perl; in fact they were probably tens of thousands of lines
of C++ or Java.  Once we actually took the plunge into e-commerce,
it turned out to be surprisingly easy to compete.<br><br>So why were we afraid?  We felt we were good at programming, but
we lacked confidence in our ability to do a mysterious, undifferentiated
thing we called "business."  In fact there is no such thing as
"business." There's selling, promotion, figuring out what people
want, deciding how much to charge, customer support, paying your
bills, getting customers to pay you, getting incorporated, raising
money, and so on.  And the combination is not as hard as it seems,   
because some tasks (like raising money and getting incorporated)
are an O(1) pain in the ass, whether you're big or small, and others
(like selling and promotion) depend more on energy and imagination
than any kind of special training.<br><br>Artix was like a hyena, content to survive on carrion because we
were afraid of the lions.  Except the lions turned out not to have 
any teeth, and the business of putting galleries online barely
qualified as carrion.<br><br><b>A Familiar Problem</b><br><br>Sum up all these sources of error, and it's no wonder we had such
a bad idea for a company.  We did the first thing we thought of;
we were ambivalent about being in business at all; and we deliberately
chose an impoverished market to avoid competition.<br><br>Looking at the applications for the Summer Founders Program, I see
signs of all three.  But the first is by far the biggest problem.  
Most of the groups applying have not stopped to ask: of all the 
things we could do, is <i>this</i> the one with the best chance of
making money?<br><br>If they'd already been through their Artix phase, they'd have learned
to ask that.  After the reception we got from art dealers, we were
ready to.  This time, we thought, let's make something people want.<br><br>Reading the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> for a week should give anyone
ideas for two or three new startups.  The articles are full of
descriptions of problems that need to be solved.  But most of the
applicants don't seem to have looked far for ideas.<br><br>We expected the most common proposal to be for multiplayer games.
We were not far off: this was the second most common. 
The most common was some combination of a blog, a calendar,
a dating site, and Friendster.  Maybe there is some new killer app
to be discovered here, but it seems perverse to go poking around
in this fog when there are valuable, unsolved problems lying about
in the open for anyone to see.  Why did no one propose a new scheme   
for micropayments?  An ambitious project, perhaps, but I can't    
believe we've considered every alternative.  And newspapers and
magazines are (literally) dying for a solution.<br><br>Why did so few applicants really think about what customers want?
I think the problem with many, as with people in their early twenties
generally, is that they've been trained their whole lives to jump
through predefined hoops.  They've spent 15-20 years solving problems
other people have set for them.  And how much time deciding what  
problems would be good to solve?  Two or three course projects?   
<!-- Robert is one of us trying to rank the applications.  He's a professor
now, and he said recently that reading the proposals felt awfully 
familiar.  -->
They're good at solving problems, but bad at choosing them.<br><br>But that, I'm convinced, is just the effect of training.  Or more
precisely, the effect of grading.  To make grading efficient,
everyone has to solve the same problem, and that means it has to
be decided in advance.  It would be great if schools taught students
how to choose problems as well as how to solve them, but I don't
know how you'd run such a class in practice.<br><br><b>Copper and Tin</b><br><br>The good news is, choosing problems is something that can be learned.
I know that from experience.  Hackers can learn to make things
customers want. 
<font color="#777777">[<a name="f6" href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>This is a controversial view.  One expert on "entrepreneurship"
told me that any startup had to include business people, because
only they could focus on what customers wanted.  I'll probably
alienate this guy forever by quoting him, but I have to risk it,
because his email was such a perfect example of this view:
</p><blockquote> 
  80% of MIT spinoffs succeed <i>provided</i> they 
  have at least one management person in the team at the start. The   
  business person represents the "voice of the customer" and that's
  what keeps the engineers and product development on track.
</blockquote>
This is, in my opinion, a crock.  Hackers are perfectly capable of
hearing the voice of the customer without a business person to
amplify the signal for them.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin were grad
students in computer science, which presumably makes them "engineers."
Do you suppose Google is only good because they had some business
guy whispering in their ears what customers wanted?   It seems to 
me the business guys who did the most for Google were the ones who 
obligingly flew Altavista into a hillside just as Google was getting
started.<br><br>The hard part about figuring out what customers want is figuring 
out that you need to figure it out.  But that's something you can
learn quickly.  It's like seeing the other interpretation of an
ambiguous picture.  As soon as someone tells you there's a rabbit
as well as a duck, it's hard not to see it.<br><br>And compared to the sort of problems hackers are used to solving,
giving customers what they want is easy.  Anyone who can write an 
optimizing compiler can design a UI that doesn't confuse users, 
once they <i>choose</i> to focus on that problem.  And once you   
apply that kind of brain power to petty but profitable questions,     
you can create wealth very rapidly.<br><br>That's the essence of a startup: having brilliant people do work
that's beneath them.   Big companies try to hire the right person
for the job.  Startups win because they don't—because they take
people so smart that they would in a big company be doing "research,"

When a friend recommended this book, I couldn't believe he was
serious.  But he insisted it was good, so I read it, and he was   
right.  It deals with the most difficult problem in human experience:
how to see things from other people's point of view, instead of
thinking only of yourself.<br><br>Most smart people don't do that very well.  But adding this ability
to raw brainpower is like adding tin to copper.  The result is
bronze, which is so much harder that it seems a different metal.<br><br>A hacker who has learned what to make, and not just how to make,
is extraordinarily powerful.  And not just at making money: look
what a small group of volunteers has achieved with Firefox.<br><br>Doing an Artix teaches you to make something people want in the
same way that not drinking anything would teach you how much you
depend on water.  But it would be more convenient for all involved
if the Summer Founders didn't learn this on our dime—if they could
skip the Artix phase and go right on to make something customers
wanted.  That, I think, is going to be the real experiment this 
summer.  How long will it take them to grasp this?<br><br><!--With us beating it into their heads constantly, that is.-->  We decided
we ought to have T-Shirts for the SFP, and we'd been thinking about   
what to print on the back.  Till now we'd been planning to use

On the other hand, he was skeptical about Viaweb too.  I have
a precise measure of that, because at one point in the first couple
months we made a bet: if he ever made a million dollars out of   
Viaweb, he'd get his ear pierced.  We didn't let him

one of them was Webvia; I swapped them to make Viaweb.<br><br>[<a name="f5n" hef="#f5"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>] 
It's much easier to sell services than a product, just as it's
easier to make a living playing at weddings than by selling recordings. 
But the margins are greater on products.  So during the   
Bubble a lot of companies used consulting to generate revenues
they could attribute to the sale of products, because it made a
better story for an IPO.<br><br>[<a name="f6n" hef="#f6"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>] 
Trevor Blackwell presents the following recipe for a startup:  
"Watch people who have money to spend, see what they're wasting
their time on, cook up a solution, and try selling it to them. It's   
surprising how small a problem can be and still provide a profitable
market for a solution."<br><br>[<a name="f7n" hef="#f7"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]

PR firms <a href="http://www.maximumexposurepr.com/middleMAA.html">tell</a> 
them to.  One of the most surprising things I discovered
during my brief business career was the existence of the PR industry,
lurking like a huge, quiet submarine beneath the news.  Of the
stories you read in traditional media that aren't about politics,
crimes, or disasters, more than half probably come from PR firms.<br><br>I know because I spent years hunting such "press hits."  Our startup spent
its entire marketing budget on PR: at a time when we were assembling
our own computers to save money, we were paying a PR firm $16,000
a month.  And they were worth it.  PR is the news equivalent of
search engine optimization; instead of buying ads, which readers
ignore, you get yourself inserted directly into the stories.  <font color="#777777">[<a name="f1" href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br><a href="http://schwartz-pr.com/client_coverage.php">Our PR firm</a>
was one of the best in the business.  In 18 months, they got press
hits in over 60 different publications.  <!-- They made us into stars. -->
And we weren't the only ones they did great things for.  
In 1997 I got a call from another
startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company.  I
told him they were PR gods, worth every penny of their outrageous   
fees.  But I remember thinking his company's name was odd.
Why call an auction site "eBay"?<br><br>
<b>Symbiosis</b><br><br>PR is not dishonest.  Not quite.  In fact, the reason the best PR
firms are so effective is precisely that they aren't dishonest.
They give reporters genuinely valuable information.  A good PR firm
won't bug reporters just because the client tells them to; they've
worked hard to build their credibility with reporters, and they
don't want to destroy it by feeding them mere propaganda.<br><br>If anyone is dishonest, it's the reporters.  The main reason PR  
firms exist is that reporters are lazy.  Or, to put it more nicely,
overworked.  Really they ought to be out there digging up stories
for themselves.  But it's so tempting to sit in their offices and
let PR firms bring the stories to them.  After all, they know good
PR firms won't lie to them.<br><br>A good flatterer doesn't lie, but tells his victim selective truths
(what a nice color your eyes are). Good PR firms use the same
strategy: they give reporters stories that are true, but whose truth
favors their clients.<br><br>For example, our PR firm often pitched stories about how the Web  
let small merchants compete with big ones.  This was perfectly true.
But the reason reporters ended up writing stories about this
particular truth, rather than some other one, was that small merchants
were our target market, and we were paying the piper.<br><br>Different publications vary greatly in their reliance on PR firms.
At the bottom of the heap are the trade press, who make most of
their money from advertising and would give the magazines away for
free if advertisers would let them.  <font color="#777777">[<a name="f2" href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font> The average
trade publication is a  bunch of ads, glued together by just enough
articles to make it look like a magazine.  They're so desperate for
"content" that some will print your press releases almost verbatim,
if you take the trouble to write them to read like articles.<br><br>At the other extreme are publications like the <i>New York Times</i>
and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>.  Their reporters do go out and
find their own stories, at least some of the time.  They'll listen 
to PR firms, but briefly and skeptically.  We managed to get press   
hits in almost every publication we wanted, but we never managed 
to crack the print edition of the <i>Times</i>.  <font color="#777777">[<a name="f3" href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The weak point of the top reporters is not laziness, but vanity.
You don't pitch stories to them.  You have to approach them as if
you were a specimen under their all-seeing microscope, and make it
seem as if the story you want them to run is something they thought 
of themselves.<br><br>Our greatest PR coup was a two-part one.  We estimated, based on
some fairly informal math, that there were about 5000 stores on the
Web.  We got one paper to print this number, which seemed neutral   
enough.  But once this "fact" was out there in print, we could quote
it to other publications, and claim that with 1000 users we had 20%
of the online store market.<br><br>This was roughly true.  We really did have the biggest share of the
online store market, and 5000 was our best guess at its size.  But
the way the story appeared in the press sounded a lot more definite.<br><br>Reporters like definitive statements.  For example, many of the
stories about Jeremy Jaynes's conviction say that he was one of the
10 worst spammers.  This "fact" originated in Spamhaus's ROKSO list,
which I think even Spamhaus would admit is a rough guess at the top
spammers.  The first stories about Jaynes cited this source, but
now it's simply repeated as if it were part of the indictment.   
<font color="#777777">[<a name="f4" href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>All you can say with certainty about Jaynes is that he was a fairly
big spammer.  But reporters don't want to print vague stuff like
"fairly big."  They want statements with punch, like "top ten." And
PR firms give them what they want.
Wearing suits, we're told, will make us 
<a href="http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2002/02/25/story5.html?t=printable">3.6
percent</a> more productive.<br><br><b>Buzz</b><br><br>Where the work of PR firms really does get deliberately misleading is in
the generation of "buzz."  They usually feed the same story to    
several different publications at once.  And when readers see similar
stories in multiple places, they think there is some important trend
afoot.  Which is exactly what they're supposed to think.<br><br>When Windows 95 was launched, people waited outside stores
at midnight to buy the first copies.  None of them would have been
there without PR firms, who generated such a buzz in
the news media that it became self-reinforcing, like a nuclear chain
reaction.<br><br>I doubt PR firms realize it yet, but the Web makes it possible to  
track them at work.  If you search for the obvious phrases, you
turn up several efforts over the years to place stories about the  
return of the suit.  For example, the Reuters article 
<!-- by Elizabeth Lazarowitz -->
that got picked up by <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2004-09-01-suits_x.htm">USA
Today</a> in September 2004.  "The suit is back," it begins.<br><br>Trend articles like this are almost always the work of
PR firms.  Once you know how to read them, it's straightforward to
figure out who the client is.  With trend stories, PR firms usually
line up one or more "experts" to talk about the industry generally. 
In this case we get three: the NPD Group, the creative director of
GQ, and a research director at Smith Barney.  <font color="#777777">[<a name="f5" href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font> When
you get to the end of the experts, look for the client. And bingo, 
there it is: The Men's Wearhouse.<br><br>Not surprising, considering The Men's Wearhouse was at that moment 
running ads saying "The Suit is Back."  Talk about a successful
press hit-- a wire service article whose first sentence is your own
ad copy.<br><br>The secret to finding other press hits from a given pitch
is to realize that they all started from the same document back at
the PR firm.  Search for a few key phrases and the names of the
clients and the experts, and you'll turn up other variants of this 
story.<br><br><a href="http://bostonworks.boston.com/globe/articles/091904_suit.html">Casual

Mercer of <i>The Detroit News</i>.<br><br>
Now that so many news articles are online, I suspect you could find
a similar pattern for most trend stories placed by PR firms.  I
propose we call this new sport "PR diving," and I'm sure there are
far more striking examples out there than this clump of five stories.<br><br><b>Online</b><br><br>After spending years chasing them, it's now second nature
to me to recognize press hits for what they are.  But before we
hired a PR firm I had no idea where articles in the mainstream media
came from.  I could tell a lot of them were crap, but I didn't
realize why.<br><br>Remember the exercises in critical reading you did in school, where
you had to look at a piece of writing and step back and ask whether
the author was telling the whole truth?  If you really want to be
a critical reader, it turns out you have to step back one step
further, and ask not just whether the author is telling the truth,
but <i>why he's writing about this subject at all.</i><br><br>Online, the answer tends to be a lot simpler.  Most people who
publish online write what they write for the simple reason that
they want to.  You
can't see the fingerprints of PR firms all over the articles, as
you can in so many print publications-- which is one of the reasons,
though they may not consciously realize it, that readers trust
bloggers more than <i>Business Week</i>.<br><br>I was talking recently to a friend who works for a
big newspaper.  He thought the print media were in serious trouble,
and that they were still mostly in denial about it.  "They think
the decline is cyclic," he said.  "Actually it's structural."<br><br>In other words, the readers are leaving, and they're not coming
back.<br><br>
Why? I think the main reason is that the writing online is more honest.
Imagine how incongruous the <i>New York Times</i> article about
suits would sound if you read it in a blog:
  <blockquote> The urge to look corporate-- sleek, commanding,
  prudent, yet with just a touch of hubris on your well-cut sleeve--
  is an unexpected development in a time of business disgrace.
  </blockquote> 
The problem
with this article is not just that it originated in a PR firm.
The whole tone is bogus.  This is the tone of someone writing down
to their audience.<br><br>Whatever its flaws, the writing you find online
is authentic.  It's not mystery meat cooked up
out of scraps of pitch letters and press releases, and pressed into 
molds of zippy
journalese.  It's people writing what they think.<br><br>I didn't realize, till there was an alternative, just how artificial
most of the writing in the mainstream media was.  I'm not saying
I used to believe what I read in <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i>.  Since high
school, at least, I've thought of magazines like that more as
guides to what ordinary people were being
<a href="say.html">told</a> to think than as  
sources of information.  But I didn't realize till the last  
few years that writing for publication didn't have to mean writing
that way.  I didn't realize you could write as candidly and
informally as you would if you were writing to a friend.<br><br>Readers aren't the only ones who've noticed the
change.  The PR industry has too.
A hilarious <a href="http://www.prsa.org/_Publications/magazines/0802news1.asp">article</a>
on the site of the PR Society of America gets to the heart of the   
matter:
  <blockquote> Bloggers are sensitive about becoming mouthpieces
  for other organizations and companies, which is the reason they
  began blogging in the first place.  </blockquote>
PR people fear bloggers for the same reason readers
like them.  And that means there may be a struggle ahead.  As
this new kind of writing draws readers away from traditional media, we
should be prepared for whatever PR mutates into to compensate.  
When I think   
how hard PR firms work to score press hits in the traditional   
media, I can't imagine they'll work any less hard to feed stories
to bloggers, if they can figure out how.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] PR has at least   
one beneficial feature: it favors small companies.  If PR didn't  
work, the only alternative would be to advertise, and only big
companies can afford that.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>] Advertisers pay 
less for ads in free publications, because they assume readers 
ignore something they get for free.  This is why so many trade
publications nominally have a cover price and yet give away free
subscriptions with such abandon.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>] Different sections
of the <i>Times</i> vary so much in their standards that they're
practically different papers.  Whoever fed the style section reporter
this story about suits coming back would have been sent packing by
the regular news reporters.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>] The most striking
example I know of this type is the "fact" that the Internet worm   
of 1988 infected 6000 computers. I was there when it was cooked up,
and this was the recipe: someone guessed that there were about
60,000 computers attached to the Internet, and that the worm might
have infected ten percent of them.<br><br>Actually no one knows how many computers the worm infected, because
the remedy was to reboot them, and this destroyed all traces.  But
people like numbers.  And so this one is now <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=internet+worm+1988+6000">replicated</a>
all over the Internet, like a little worm of its own.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>] Not all were
necessarily supplied by the PR firm. Reporters sometimes call a few
additional sources on their own, like someone adding a few fresh 
vegetables to a can of soup.<br><br><!-- [<a name="f6n"><font color=#000000>6</font></a>] More precisely,
they're driven by a kind of devotion that includes a large admixture
of vanity.  But writers have always been like this, no matter what the
medium.

<p>
May 2005<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at the Berkeley CSUA.)</i><br><br>The three big powers on the Internet now are Yahoo, Google, and
Microsoft.  Average age of their founders: 24.  So it is pretty
well established now that grad students can start successful
companies.  And if grad students can do it, why not undergrads?<br><br>Like everything else in technology, the cost of starting a startup
has decreased dramatically.  Now it's so low that it has disappeared
into the noise. The main cost of starting a Web-based
startup is food and rent.  Which means it doesn't cost much more
to start a company than to be a total slacker.  You can probably
start a startup on ten thousand dollars of seed funding, if you're
prepared to live on ramen.<br><br>The less it costs to start a company, the less you need the permission
of investors to do it.  So a lot of people will be able to start
companies now who never could have before.<br><br>The most interesting subset may be those in their early twenties.
I'm not so excited about founders who have everything investors
want except intelligence, or everything except energy.  The most
promising group to be liberated by the new, lower threshold are
those who have everything investors want except experience.<br><br><b>Market Rate</b><br><br>I once claimed that <a href="nerds.html">nerds</a> were unpopular
in secondary school mainly because they had better things to do
than work full-time at being popular.  Some said I was just telling
people what they wanted to hear.  Well, I'm now about to do that
in a spectacular way: I think undergraduates are undervalued.<br><br>Or more precisely, I think few realize the huge
spread in the value of 20 year olds.  Some, it's true, are not very
capable.  But others are more capable than all but a handful of 30
year olds. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Till now the problem has always been that it's difficult to pick
them out.  Every VC in the world, if they could go back in time,
would try to invest in Microsoft.  But which would have then?  How
many would have understood that this particular 19 year old was
Bill Gates?<br><br>It's hard to judge the young because (a) they change rapidly, (b)
there is great variation between them, and (c) they're individually
inconsistent.  That last one is a big problem.  When you're young,
you occasionally say and do stupid things even when you're smart.
So if the algorithm is to filter out people who say stupid things,
as many investors and employers unconsciously do, you're going to
get a lot of false positives.<br><br>Most organizations who hire people right out of college are only
aware of the average value of 22 year olds, which is not that high.  
And so the idea for most of the twentieth century was that everyone
had to begin as a trainee in some 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=158756&amp;cid=13299057">entry-level</a> job.  Organizations  
realized there was a lot of variation in the incoming stream, but
instead of pursuing this thought they tended to suppress it, in the
belief that it was good for even the most promising kids to start 
at the bottom, so they didn't get swelled heads.<br><br>The most productive young people will <i>always</i> be undervalued
by large organizations, because the young have no performance to
measure yet, and any error in guessing their ability will tend 
toward the mean.<br><br>What's an especially productive 22 year old to do?  One thing you   
can do is go over the heads of organizations, directly to the users.
Any company that hires you is, economically, acting as a proxy for
the customer.  The rate at which they value you (though they may
not consciously realize it) is an attempt to guess your value to  
the user.  But there's a way to appeal their judgement.  If you
want, you can opt to be valued directly by users, by starting your
own company.<br><br>The market is a lot more discerning than any employer.  And it is
completely non-discriminatory.  On the Internet, nobody knows you're
a dog.  And more to the point, nobody knows you're 22.  All users
care about is whether your site or software gives them what they
want.  They don't care if the person behind it is a high school 
kid.<br><br>If you're really productive, why not make employers pay market rate
for you?  Why go work as an ordinary employee for a big
company, when you could start a startup and make them buy it to get
you?<br><br>When most people hear the word "startup," they think of the famous 
ones that have gone public.  But most startups that succeed do it
by getting bought.  And usually the acquirer doesn't just want the
technology, but the people who created it as well.<br><br>Often big companies buy startups before they're profitable.  Obviously
in such cases they're not after revenues.  What they want is the  
development team and the software they've built so far.  When a
startup gets bought for 2 or 3 million six months in, it's really
more of a hiring bonus than an acquisition.<br><br>I think this sort of thing will happen more and more, and that it 
will be better for everyone.  It's obviously better for the people
who start the startup, because they get a big chunk of money up
front.  But I think it will be better for the acquirers too.  The
central problem in big companies, and the main reason they're so 
much less productive than small companies, is the difficulty of
valuing each person's work.  Buying larval startups solves that   
problem for them: the acquirer doesn't pay till the developers have
proven themselves.  Acquirers are protected on the downside, but   
still get most of the upside.<br><br><b>Product Development</b><br><br>Buying startups also solves another problem afflicting big companies:
they can't do product development.  Big companies are good at
extracting the value from existing products, but bad at creating   
new ones.<br><br>Why? It's worth studying this phenomenon in detail, because this  
is the raison d'etre of startups.<br><br>To start with, most big companies have some kind of turf to protect,
and this tends to warp their development decisions.  For example,
<a href="road.html">Web-based</a> applications are hot now, but
within Microsoft there must
be a lot of ambivalence about them, because the very idea of Web-based
software threatens the desktop.  So any Web-based application that  
Microsoft ends up with, will probably, like Hotmail, be something   
developed outside the company.<br><br>Another reason big companies are bad at developing new products is
that the kind of people who do that tend not to have much power in
big companies (unless they happen to be the CEO).  Disruptive
technologies are developed by disruptive people.  And they either
don't work for the big company, or have been outmaneuvered by yes-men
and have comparatively little influence.<br><br>Big companies also lose because they usually only build one of each
thing.  When you only have one Web browser, you can't do anything
really risky with it.  If ten different startups design ten different
Web browsers and you take the best, you'll probably get something
better.<br><br>The more general version of this problem is that there are too many
new ideas for companies to explore them all.  There might be 500   
startups right now who think they're making something Microsoft
might buy.  Even Microsoft probably couldn't manage 500 development
projects in-house.<br><br>Big companies also don't pay people the right way.  People developing
a new product at a big company get paid roughly the same whether
it succeeds or fails.  People at a startup expect to get rich if
the product succeeds, and get nothing if it fails. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>  So naturally
the people at the startup work a lot harder.<br><br>The mere bigness of big companies is an obstacle.  In startups,  
developers are often forced to talk directly to users, whether they
want to or not, because there is no one else to do sales and support.
It's painful doing sales, but you learn much more from
trying to sell people something than reading what   
they said in focus groups.<br><br>And then of course, big companies are bad at product development 
because they're bad at everything.  Everything happens slower in
big companies than small ones, and product development is something
that has to happen fast, because you have to go through a lot of   
iterations to get something good.<br><br><b>Trend</b><br><br>I think the trend of big companies buying startups will only
accelerate.  One of the biggest remaining obstacles is pride.  Most  
companies, at least unconsciously, feel they ought to be able to
develop stuff in house, and that buying startups is to some degree 
an admission of failure.  And so, as people generally do with
admissions of failure, they put it off for as long as possible.
That makes the acquisition very expensive when it finally happens.<br><br>What companies should do is go out and discover startups when they're
young, before VCs have puffed them up into something that costs
hundreds of millions to acquire.  Much of what VCs add, the acquirer
doesn't need anyway.<br><br>Why don't acquirers try to predict the companies they're going to
have to buy for hundreds of millions, and grab them early for a     
tenth or a twentieth of that?  Because they can't predict the winners
in advance?  If they're only paying a twentieth as much, they only
have to predict a twentieth as well.  Surely they can manage that.<br><br>I think companies that acquire technology will gradually learn to 
go after earlier stage startups.  They won't necessarily buy them
outright.  The solution may be some hybrid of investment and
acquisition: for example, to buy a chunk of the company and get an
option to buy the rest later.<br><br>When companies buy startups, they're effectively fusing recruiting 
and product development.  And I think that's more efficient than 
doing the two separately, because you always get people who are
really committed to what they're working on.<br><br>Plus this method yields teams of developers who already work well
together.  Any conflicts between them have been ironed out under   
the very hot iron of running a startup.  By the time the acquirer  
gets them, they're finishing one another's sentences.  That's  
valuable in software, because so many bugs occur at the boundaries 
between different people's code.<br><br><b>Investors</b><br><br>The increasing cheapness of starting a company doesn't just give
hackers more power relative to employers.  It also gives them more 
power relative to investors.<br><br>The conventional wisdom among VCs is that hackers shouldn't be   
allowed to run their own companies.  The founders are supposed to  
accept MBAs as their bosses, and themselves take on some title like  
Chief Technical Officer.  There may be cases where this is a good 
idea.  But I think founders will increasingly be able to push back
in the matter of control, because they just don't need the investors'
money as much as they used to.<br><br>Startups are a comparatively new phenomenon.  Fairchild Semiconductor
is considered the first VC-backed startup, and they were founded   
in 1959, less than fifty years ago.  Measured on the time scale of   
social change, what we have now is pre-beta.  So we shouldn't assume
the way startups work now is the way they have to work.<br><br>Fairchild needed a lot of money to get started.  They had to build
actual factories.  What does the first round of venture funding for
a Web-based startup get spent on today?  More money can't get
software written faster; it isn't needed for facilities, because
those can now be quite cheap; all money can really buy you is sales
and marketing.  A sales force is worth something, I'll admit.  But
marketing is increasingly irrelevant.  On the Internet, anything
genuinely good will spread by word of mouth.<br><br>Investors' power comes from money.  When startups need less money,   
investors have less power over them.  So future founders may not
have to accept new CEOs if they don't want them.  The VCs will have 
to be dragged kicking and screaming down this road, but like many
things people have to be dragged kicking and screaming toward, it
may actually be good for them.<br><br>Google is a sign of the way things are going.  As a condition of
funding, their investors insisted they hire someone old and experienced
as CEO.  But from what I've heard the founders didn't just give in
and take whoever the VCs wanted.  They delayed for an entire year,
and when they did finally take a CEO, they chose a guy with a PhD 
in computer science.<br><br>It sounds to me as if the founders are still the most powerful
people in the company, and judging by Google's performance, their
youth and inexperience doesn't seem to have hurt them.  Indeed, I
suspect Google has done better than they would have if the founders
had given the VCs what they wanted, when they wanted it, and let 
some MBA take over as soon as they got their first round of funding.<br><br>I'm not claiming the business guys installed by VCs have no value.
Certainly they have.  But they don't need to become the founders'
bosses, which is what that title CEO means.  I predict that in the 
future the executives installed by VCs will increasingly be COOs
rather than CEOs.  The founders will run engineering directly, and
the rest of the company through the COO.<br><br><b>The Open Cage</b><br><br>With both employers and investors, the balance of power is slowly
shifting towards the young.  And yet they seem the last to realize
it.  Only the most ambitious undergrads even consider starting their
own company when they graduate.  Most just want to get a job.<br><br>Maybe this is as it should be.  Maybe if the idea of starting a  
startup is intimidating, you filter out the uncommitted.  But I    
suspect the filter is set a little too high.  I think there are
people who could, if they tried, start successful startups, and who
instead let themselves be swept into the intake ducts of big
companies.<br><br>Have you ever noticed that when animals are let out of cages, they
don't always realize at first that the door's open?  Often they
have to be poked with a stick to get them out.  Something similar  
happened with blogs.  People could have been publishing online in    
1995, and yet blogging has only really taken off in the last couple
years.  In 1995 we thought only professional writers were entitled
to publish their ideas, and that anyone else who did was a crank.
Now publishing online is becoming so popular that everyone wants  
to do it, even print journalists.  But blogging has not taken off  
recently because of any technical innovation; it just took eight
years for everyone to realize the cage was open.<br><br>I think most undergrads don't realize yet that the economic cage  
is open.  A lot have been told by their parents that the route to
success is to get a good job.  This was true when their parents
were in college, but it's less true now. The route to success is
to build something valuable, and you don't have to be working for    
an existing company to do that.  Indeed, you can often do it better
if you're not.<br><br>When I talk to undergrads, what surprises me most about them is how
conservative they are.   Not politically, of course.  I mean they
don't seem to want to take risks.  This is a mistake, because the
younger you are, the more risk you can take.<br><br><b>Risk</b><br><br>Risk and reward are always proportionate.  For example, stocks are
riskier than bonds, and over time always have greater returns.  So
why does anyone invest in bonds?  The catch is that phrase "over
time."  Stocks will generate greater returns over thirty years, but
they might lose value from year to year.  So what you should invest
in depends on how soon you need the money.  If you're young, you 
should take the riskiest investments you can find.<br><br>All this talk about investing may seem very theoretical.  Most
undergrads probably have more debts than assets.  They may feel
they have nothing to invest.  But that's not true: they have their
time to invest, and the same rule about risk applies there.  Your
early twenties are exactly the time to take insane career risks.<br><br>The reason risk is always proportionate to reward is that market  
forces make it so.  People will pay extra for stability.  So if you
choose stability-- by buying bonds, or by going to work for a big
company-- it's going to cost you.<br><br>Riskier career moves pay better on average, because there is less
demand for them.  Extreme choices like starting a startup are so  
frightening that most people won't even try.  So you don't end up   
having as much competition as you might expect, considering the
prizes at stake.<br><br>The math is brutal.  While perhaps 9 out of 10 startups fail, the  
one that succeeds will pay the founders more than 10 times what
they would have made in an ordinary job. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>
That's the sense in
which startups pay better "on average."<br><br>Remember that.  If you start a startup, you'll probably fail.  Most
startups fail. It's the nature of the business.  But it's not
necessarily a mistake to try something that has a 90% chance of
failing, if you can afford the risk.  Failing at 40, when you have 
a family to support, could be serious.  But if you fail at 22, so    
what?  If you try to start a startup right out of college and it   
tanks, you'll end up at 23 broke and a lot smarter.  Which, if you
think about it, is roughly what you hope to get from a graduate  
program.<br><br>Even if your startup does tank, you won't harm your prospects with
employers.  To make sure I asked some friends who work for big
companies.  I asked managers at Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Cisco and
Microsoft how they'd feel about two candidates, both 24, with equal
ability, one who'd tried to start a startup that tanked, and another
who'd spent the two years since college working as a developer at
a big company.  Every one responded that they'd prefer the guy who'd
tried to start his own company.  Zod Nazem, who's in charge of       
engineering at Yahoo, said:
  </p><blockquote> I actually put more value on the guy with the failed
  startup.  And you can quote me!  </blockquote>
So there you have it.  Want to get hired by Yahoo?  Start your own 
company.<br><br><b>The Man is the Customer</b><br><br>If even big employers think highly of young hackers who start
companies, why don't more do it?  Why are undergrads so conservative?
I think it's because they've spent so much time in institutions.<br><br>The first twenty years of everyone's life consists of being piped
from one institution to another.  You probably didn't have much
choice about the secondary schools you went to.  And after high
school it was probably understood that you were supposed to go to
college.  You may have had a few different colleges to choose
between, but they were probably pretty similar.  So by this point
you've been riding on a subway line for twenty years, and the next
stop seems to be a job.<br><br>Actually college is where the line ends.  Superficially, going to
work for a company may feel like just the next in a series of      
institutions, but underneath, everything is different.  The end of
school is the fulcrum of your life, the point where you go from   
net consumer to net producer.<br><br>The other big change is that now, you're steering.  You can go
anywhere you want. So it may be worth standing back and understanding
what's going on, instead of just doing the default thing.<br><br>All through college, and probably long before that, most undergrads 
have been thinking about what employers want.  But what really 
matters is what customers want, because they're the ones who give
employers the money to pay you.<br><br>So instead of thinking about what employers want, you're probably
better off thinking directly about what users want.  To the extent 
there's any difference between the two, you can even use that to
your advantage if you start a company of your own.  For example,
big companies like docile conformists.  But this is merely an
artifact of their bigness, not something customers need.<br><br><b>Grad School</b><br><br>I didn't consciously realize all this when I was graduating from   
college-- partly because I went straight to grad school.  Grad
school can be a pretty good deal, even if you think of one day   
starting a startup.  You can start one when you're done, or even
pull the ripcord part way through, like the founders of Yahoo and
Google.<br><br>Grad school makes a good launch pad for startups, because you're
collected together with a lot of smart people, and you have bigger 
chunks of time to work on your own projects than an undergrad or
corporate employee would.  As long as you have a fairly tolerant
advisor, you can take your time developing an idea before turning   
it into a company.  David Filo and Jerry Yang started the Yahoo      
directory in February 1994 and were getting a million hits a day
by the fall, but they didn't actually drop out of grad school and
start a company till March 1995.<br><br>You could also try the startup first, and if it doesn't work, then
go to grad school.  When startups tank they usually do it fairly
quickly. Within a year you'll know if you're wasting your time.<br><br>If it fails, that is.  If it succeeds, you may have to delay grad
school a little longer.  But you'll have a much more enjoyable life  
once there than you would on a regular grad student stipend.<br><br><b>Experience</b><br><br>Another reason people in their early twenties don't start startups
is that they feel they don't have enough experience.  Most investors
feel the same.<br><br>I remember hearing a lot of that word "experience" when I was in  
college.  What do people really mean by it?  Obviously it's not the
experience itself that's valuable, but something it changes in your
brain.  What's different about your brain after you have "experience,"
and can you make that change happen faster?<br><br>I now have some data on this, and I can tell you what tends to be 
missing when people lack experience.  I've said that every 
<a href="start.html">startup</a> needs three things: to start with good people,
to make something users want, and not to spend too much money.  It's
the middle one you get wrong when you're inexperienced.  There are   
plenty of undergrads with enough technical skill to write good
software, and undergrads are not especially prone to waste money.
If they get something wrong, it's usually not realizing they have   
to make something people <a href="bronze.html">want</a>.<br><br>This is not exclusively a failing of the young.  It's common for
startup founders of all ages to build things no one wants.<br><br>Fortunately, this flaw should be easy to fix.  If undergrads were  
all bad programmers, the problem would be a lot harder.  It can 
take years to learn how to program.  But I don't think it takes 
years to learn how to make things people want.  My hypothesis is
that all you have to do is smack hackers on the side of the head
and tell them: Wake up.  Don't sit here making up a priori theories
about what users need.  Go find some users and see what they need.<br><br>Most successful startups not only do something very specific, but  
solve a problem people already know they have.<br><br>The big change that "experience" causes in your brain is learning
that you need to solve people's problems.  Once you grasp that, you
advance quickly to the next step, which is figuring out what those
problems are.  And that takes some effort, because the way software
actually gets used, especially by the people who pay the most for
it, is not at all what you might expect.  For example, the stated  
purpose of Powerpoint is to present ideas.  Its real role is to 
overcome people's fear of public speaking.  It allows you to give
an impressive-looking talk about nothing, and it causes the audience
to sit in a dark room looking at slides, instead of a bright one     
looking at you.<br><br>This kind of thing is out there for anyone to see.  The key is to
know to look for it-- to realize that having an idea for a startup
is not like having an idea for a class project.  The goal in a
startup is not to write a cool piece of software.  It's to make 
something people want.  And to do that you have to look at users--
forget about hacking, and just look at users.  This can be quite a
mental adjustment, because little if any of the software you write
in school even has users.  <!-- Imagine the shock you'd feel if you
spent eight years practicing football drills and only then had to
play against an opposing team.  That's the scale of adjustment
involved. --><br><br>A few steps before a Rubik's Cube is solved, it still looks like a
mess.  I think there are a lot of undergrads whose brains are in a  
similar position: they're only a few steps away from being able to
start successful startups, if they wanted to, but they don't realize
it.  They have more than enough technical skill.  They just haven't
realized yet that the way to create wealth is to make what users   
want, and that employers are just proxies for users in which risk  
is pooled.<br><br>If you're young and smart, you don't need either of those.  You
don't need someone else to tell you what users want, because you  
can figure it out yourself.  And you don't want to pool risk, because
the younger you are, the more risk you should take.<br><br><b>A Public Service Message</b><br><br>I'd like to conclude with a joint message from me and your parents.
Don't drop out of college to start a startup.  There's no rush.     
There will be plenty of time to start companies after you graduate.
In fact, it may be just as well to go work for an existing company
for a couple years after you graduate, to learn how companies work.<br><br>And yet, when I think about it, I can't imagine telling Bill Gates
at 19 that he should wait till he graduated to start a company.    
He'd have told me to get lost.  And could I have honestly claimed
that he was harming his future-- that he was learning less by working
at ground zero of the microcomputer revolution than he would have
if he'd been taking classes back at Harvard?  No, probably not.<br><br>And yes, while it is probably true that you'll learn some valuable
things by going to work for an existing company for a couple years
before starting your own, you'd learn a thing or two running your  
own company during that time too.<br><br>The advice about going to work for someone else would get an even
colder reception from the 19 year old Bill Gates.  So I'm supposed 
to finish college, then go work for another company for two years,
and then I can start my own?  I have to wait till I'm 23?  That's  
<i>four years</i>.  That's more than twenty percent of my life so
far.  Plus in four years it will be way too late to make money     
writing a Basic interpreter for the Altair.<br><br>And he'd be right.  The Apple II was launched just two years later.
In fact, if Bill had finished college and gone to work for another
company as we're suggesting, he might well have gone to work for
Apple.  And while that would probably have been better for all of
us, it wouldn't have been better for him.<br><br>So while I stand by our responsible advice to finish college and
then go work for a while before starting a startup, I have to admit
it's one of those things the old tell the young, but don't expect
them to listen to.  We say this sort of thing mainly so we can claim
we warned you.  So don't say I didn't warn you.<br><br><br><br>

Ten years ago there seemed a real danger Microsoft would extend its
monopoly to servers.  It seems safe to say now that open source has
prevented that.  A recent survey found 52% of companies are replacing
Windows servers with Linux servers.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>More significant, I think, is <i>which</i> 52% they are.  At this point,
anyone proposing to run Windows on servers should be prepared to
explain what they know about servers that Google, Yahoo, and Amazon
don't.<br><br>But the biggest thing business has to learn from open source is not
about Linux or Firefox, but about the forces that produced them.
Ultimately these will affect a lot more than what software you use.<br><br>We may be able to get a fix on these underlying forces by triangulating
from open source and blogging.  As you've probably noticed, they
have a lot in common.<br><br>Like open source, blogging is something people do themselves, for
free, because they enjoy it.  Like open source hackers, bloggers
compete with people working for money, and often win.  The method
of ensuring quality is also the same: Darwinian.  Companies ensure
quality through rules to prevent employees from screwing up.  But
you don't need that when the audience can communicate with one
another.  People just produce whatever they want; the good stuff
spreads, and the bad gets ignored.  And in both cases, feedback
from the audience improves the best work.<br><br>Another thing blogging and open source have in common is the Web.
People have always been willing to do great work
for free,  but before the Web it was harder to reach an audience
or collaborate on projects.<br><br><b>Amateurs</b><br><br>I think the most important of the new principles business has to learn is
that people work a lot harder on stuff they like.  Well, that's
news to no one.  So how can I claim business has to learn it?  When
I say business doesn't know this, I mean the structure of business
doesn't reflect it.<br><br>Business still reflects an older model, exemplified by the French
word for working: <i>travailler</i>.  It has an English cousin, travail,
and what it means is torture.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>This turns out not to be the last word on work, however.
As societies get richer, they learn something about
work that's a lot like what they learn about diet.  We know now that the
healthiest diet is the one our peasant ancestors were forced to
eat because they were poor.  Like rich food, idleness
only seems desirable when you don't get enough of it.  I think we were
designed to work, just as we were designed to eat a certain amount
of fiber, and we feel bad if we don't.<br><br>There's a name for people who work for the love of it: amateurs.
The word now has such bad connotations that we forget its etymology,
though it's staring us in the face.  "Amateur" was originally rather
a complimentary word.  But the thing to be in the twentieth century
was professional, which amateurs, by definition, are not.<br><br>That's why the business world was so surprised by one lesson from
open source: that people working for love often surpass those working
for money.   Users don't switch from Explorer to Firefox because
they want to hack the source.  They switch because it's a better
browser.<br><br>It's not that Microsoft isn't trying.  They know controlling the
browser is one of the keys to retaining their monopoly.  The problem
is the same they face in operating systems: they can't pay people
enough to build something better than a group of inspired hackers
will build for free.<br><br>I suspect professionalism was always overrated-- not just in the
literal sense of working for money, but also connotations like
formality and detachment.  Inconceivable as it would have seemed
in, say, 1970, I think professionalism was largely a fashion,
driven by conditions that happened to exist in the twentieth century.<br><br>One of the most powerful of those was the existence of "channels." Revealingly,
the same term was used for both products and information:  there
were distribution channels, and TV and radio channels.<br><br>It was the narrowness of such channels that made professionals
seem so superior to amateurs.  There were only a few jobs as
professional journalists, for example, so competition ensured the
average journalist was fairly good.  Whereas anyone can express
opinions about current events in a bar.  And so the average person
expressing his opinions in a bar sounds like an idiot compared to
a journalist writing about the subject.<br><br>On the Web, the barrier for publishing your ideas is even lower.
You don't have to buy a drink, and they even let kids in.
Millions of people are publishing online, and the average
level of what they're writing, as you might expect, is not very
good.  This has led some in the media to conclude that blogs don't
present much of a threat-- that blogs are just a fad.<br><br>Actually, the fad is the word "blog,"  at least the way the print
media now use it.  What they mean by "blogger" is not someone who
publishes in a weblog format, but anyone who publishes online.
That's going to become a problem as the Web becomes the default
medium for publication.  So I'd
like to suggest an alternative word for someone who publishes online.
How about "writer?"<br><br>Those in the print media who dismiss the writing online because of
its low average quality are missing an important point: no one reads
the <i>average</i> blog.  In the old world of channels, it meant something
to talk about average quality, because that's what you were getting
whether you liked it or not.
But now you can read any writer you want.  So the average
quality of writing online isn't what the print media are competing
against.  They're competing against the best writing online.  And, 
like Microsoft, they're losing.<br><br>I know that from my own experience as a reader.  Though most print
publications are online, I probably
read two or three articles on individual people's sites for every
one I read on the site of a newspaper or magazine.<br><br>And when I read, say, New York Times stories, I never reach
them through the Times front page.   Most I find through aggregators
like Google News or Slashdot or Delicious. Aggregators show how
much <a href="http://reddit.com">better</a> 
you can do than the channel.  The New York Times front page is
a list of articles written by people who work for the New York Times.  Delicious
is a list of articles that are interesting.  And it's only now that
you can see the two side by side that you notice how little overlap there is.<br><br>Most articles in the print media are boring.  For example, the
president notices that a majority of voters now think invading Iraq
was a mistake, so he makes an address to the nation to drum up
support.  Where is the man bites dog in that?  I didn't hear the
speech, but I could probably tell you exactly what he said.  A
speech like that is, in the most literal sense, not news: there is
nothing <i>new</i> in it.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Nor is there anything new, except the names and places, in most
"news" about things going wrong.  A child is abducted; there's a
tornado; a ferry sinks; someone gets bitten by a shark; a small
plane crashes.  And what do you learn about the world from these
stories?  Absolutely nothing.  They're outlying data points; what
makes them gripping also makes them irrelevant.<br><br>As in software, when professionals produce such crap, it's not
surprising if amateurs can do better.  Live by the channel, die by
the channel: if you depend on an oligopoly, you sink into bad habits
that are hard to overcome when you suddenly get competition.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Workplaces</b><br><br>Another thing blogs and open source software have in common is that
they're often made by people working at home.  That may not seem
surprising.  But it should be.  It's the architectural equivalent
of a home-made aircraft shooting down an F-18.  Companies spend
millions to build office buildings for a single purpose: to be a
place to work.  And yet people working in their own homes,
which aren't even designed to be workplaces, end up
being more productive.<br><br>This proves something a lot of us have suspected.  The average
office is a miserable place to get work done.  And a lot of what
makes offices bad are the very qualities we associate with
professionalism.  The sterility
of offices is supposed to suggest efficiency.  But suggesting
efficiency is a different thing from actually being efficient.<br><br>The atmosphere of the average workplace is to productivity what
flames painted on the side of a car are to speed.  And it's not
just the way offices look that's bleak.  The way people act is just
as bad.<br><br>Things are different in a startup.  Often as not a startup begins
in an apartment.  Instead of matching beige cubicles
they have an assortment of furniture they bought used.  They work
odd hours, wearing the most casual of clothing.  They look at
whatever they want online without worrying whether it's "work safe."
The cheery, bland language of the office is replaced by wicked humor.  And
you know what?  The company at this stage is probably the most
productive it's ever going to be.<br><br>Maybe it's not a coincidence.  Maybe some aspects of professionalism
are actually a net lose.<br><br>To me the most demoralizing aspect of the traditional office is
that you're supposed to be there at certain times.  There are usually
a few people in a company who really have to, but the reason most
employees work fixed hours is that the company can't measure their
productivity.<br><br>The basic idea behind office hours is that if you can't make people
work, you can at least prevent them from having fun.  If employees
have to be in the building a certain number of hours a day, and are
forbidden to do non-work things while there, then they must be
working.  In theory.  In practice they spend a lot of their time
in a no-man's land, where they're neither working nor having fun.<br><br>If you could measure how much work people did, many companies
wouldn't need any fixed workday. You could just say: this is what
you have to do.  Do it whenever you like, wherever you like.  If
your work requires you to talk to other people in the company, then
you may need to be here a certain amount.  Otherwise we don't care.<br><br>That may seem utopian, but it's what we told people who came to
work for our company.  There were no fixed office hours.  I never
showed up before 11 in the morning.  But we weren't saying this to
be benevolent.  We were saying: if you work here we expect you to
get a lot done.  Don't try to fool us just by being here a lot.<br><br>The problem with the facetime model is not just that it's demoralizing, but
that the people pretending to work interrupt
the ones actually working.  I'm convinced the facetime model
is the main reason large organizations have so many meetings.
Per capita, large organizations accomplish very little.
And yet all those people have to be on site at least eight hours a
day.  When so much time goes in one end and so little achievement
comes out the other, something has to give.  And meetings are the
main mechanism for taking up the slack.<br><br>For one year I worked at a regular nine to five job, and I remember
well the strange, cozy feeling that comes over one during meetings.
I was very aware, because of the novelty, that I was being paid for
programming.  It seemed just amazing, as if there was a machine on
my desk that spat out a dollar bill every two minutes no matter
what I did.  Even while I was in the bathroom!  But because the
imaginary machine was always running, I felt I always ought to be
working. And so meetings felt wonderfully relaxing.  They
counted as work, just like programming, but they were so much easier.
All you had to do was sit and look attentive.<br><br>Meetings are like an opiate with a network effect.  So is email,
on a smaller scale.  And in addition to the direct cost in time,
there's the cost in fragmentation-- breaking people's day up into
bits too small to be useful.<br><br>You can see how dependent you've become on something by removing
it suddenly.  So for big companies I propose the following experiment.
Set aside one day where meetings are forbidden-- where everyone has to
sit at their desk all day and work without interruption on
things they can do without talking to anyone else.
Some amount of communication is necessary in most jobs, but I'm
sure many employees could find eight hours worth of stuff they could
do by themselves.  You could call it "Work Day."<br><br>The other problem with pretend work
is that it often looks better than real work.  When I'm
writing or hacking I spend as much time just thinking as I do
actually typing.  Half the time I'm sitting drinking a cup of tea,
or walking around the neighborhood.  This is a critical phase--
this is where ideas come from-- and yet I'd feel guilty doing this
in most offices, with everyone else looking busy.<br><br>It's hard to see how bad some practice is till you have something
to compare it to.  And that's one reason open source, and even blogging
in some cases, are so important.  They show us what real work looks like.<br><br>We're funding eight new startups at the moment.  A friend asked
what they were doing for office space, and seemed surprised when I
said we expected them to work out of whatever apartments they found
to live in.  But we didn't propose that to save money.  We did it
because we want their software to be good.  Working in crappy
informal spaces is one of the things startups do right without
realizing it.  As soon as you get into an office, work and life
start to drift apart.<br><br>That is one of the key tenets of professionalism. Work and life
are supposed to be separate.  But that part, I'm convinced, is a 
mistake.<br><br><b>Bottom-Up</b><br><br>The third big lesson we can learn from open source and
blogging is that ideas can bubble up from the bottom, instead of
flowing down from the top.  Open source and blogging both work
bottom-up: people make what they want, and the best stuff
prevails.<br><br>Does this sound familiar?  It's the principle of a market economy.
Ironically, though open source and blogs are done for free, those
worlds resemble market economies, while most companies, for all
their talk about the value of free markets, are run internally like
communist states.<br><br>There are two forces that together steer design: ideas about
what to do next, and the enforcement of quality.  In the channel
era, both flowed down from the top.  For example, newspaper editors
assigned stories to reporters, then edited what they wrote.<br><br>Open source and blogging show us things don't have to work that
way.  Ideas and even the enforcement of quality can flow bottom-up.
And in both cases the results are not merely acceptable, but better.
For example, open source software is more reliable precisely because
it's open source; anyone can find mistakes.<br><br>The same happens with writing.  As we got close to publication, I
found I was very worried about the essays in 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596006624">Hackers
&amp; Painters</a>
that hadn't been online.  Once an essay has had a couple thousand
page views I feel reasonably confident about it.  But these had had 
literally orders of magnitude less scrutiny.  It felt like
releasing software without testing it.<br><br>That's what all publishing used to be like.  If
you got ten people to read a manuscript, you were lucky.  But I'd
become so used to publishing online that the old method now seemed
alarmingly unreliable, like navigating by dead reckoning once you'd
gotten used to a GPS.<br><br>The other thing I like about publishing online is that you can write
what you want and publish when you want.  Earlier this year I wrote
<a href="inequality.html">something</a> that seemed suitable for a magazine, so
I sent it to an editor I know.
As I was waiting to hear back, I found to my surprise that I was
hoping they'd reject it.  Then I could put it online right away.
If they accepted it, it wouldn't be read by anyone for months, and
in the meantime I'd have to fight word-by-word to save it from being
mangled by some twenty five year old copy editor.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Many employees would <i>like</i> to build great things for the companies
they work for, but more often than not management won't let them.
How many of us have heard stories of employees going to management
and saying, please let us build this thing to make money for you--
and the company saying no?  The most famous example is probably Steve Wozniak,
who originally wanted to build microcomputers for his then-employer, HP.
And they turned him down.  On the blunderometer, this episode ranks
with IBM accepting a non-exclusive license for DOS.  But I think this
happens all the time.  We just don't hear about it usually,
because to prove yourself right you have to quit
and start your own company, like Wozniak did.<br><br><b>Startups</b><br><br>So these, I think, are the three big lessons open source and blogging
have to teach business: (1) that people work harder on stuff they
like, (2) that the standard office environment is very unproductive,
and (3) that bottom-up often works better than top-down.<br><br>I can imagine managers at this point saying: what is this guy talking
about?  What good does it do me to know that my programmers
would be more productive
working at home on their own projects?  I need their asses in here
working on version 3.2 of our software, or we're never going to
make the release date.<br><br>And it's true, the benefit that specific manager could derive from
the forces I've described is near zero.  When I say business can
learn from open source, I don't mean any specific business can.  I
mean business can learn about new conditions the same way a gene
pool does.  I'm not claiming companies can get smarter, just that
dumb ones will die.<br><br>So what will business look like when it has assimilated the lessons
of open source and blogging?  I think the big obstacle preventing
us from seeing the future of business is the assumption that people
working for you have to be employees.  But think about what's going
on underneath:  the company has some money, and they pay it to the
employee in the hope that he'll make something worth more than they
paid him.  Well, there are other ways to arrange that relationship.
Instead of paying the guy money as a salary, why not give it to him
as investment?  Then instead of coming to your office to work on
your projects, he can work wherever he wants on projects of his own.<br><br>Because few of us know any alternative, we have no idea how much
better we could do than the traditional employer-employee relationship.
Such customs evolve with glacial slowness.  Our 
employer-employee relationship still retains a big chunk of
master-servant DNA.
<font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>I dislike being on either end of it.
I'll work my ass off for a customer, but I resent being told what
to do by a boss.  And being a boss is also horribly frustrating; 
half the time it's easier just to do stuff yourself than to get
someone else to do it for you.
I'd rather do almost anything than give or receive a
performance review.<br><br>On top of its unpromising origins, employment
has accumulated a lot of cruft over the years.  The list of what
you can't ask in job interviews is now so long that for convenience
I assume it's infinite.  Within the
office you now have to walk on eggshells lest anyone 
<a href="say.html">say</a> or do
something that makes the company prey to a lawsuit.  And God help
you if you fire anyone.<br><br>Nothing shows more clearly that employment is not an ordinary economic
relationship than companies being sued for firing people.  In any
purely economic relationship you're free to do what you want.  If
you want to stop buying steel pipe from one supplier and start
buying it from another, you don't have to explain why.  No one can
accuse you of <i>unjustly</i> switching pipe suppliers.  Justice implies
some kind of paternal obligation that isn't there in
transactions between equals.<br><br>Most of the legal restrictions on employers are intended to protect
employees.  But you can't have action without an equal and opposite
reaction.  You can't expect employers to have some kind of paternal
responsibility toward employees without putting employees in the
position of children.  And that seems a bad road to go down.<br><br>Next time you're in a moderately large city, drop by the main post
office and watch the body language of the people working there.
They have the same sullen resentment as children made to do
something they don't want to.  Their union has exacted pay
increases and work restrictions that would have been the envy of
previous generations of postal workers, and yet they don't seem any
happier for it.  It's demoralizing
to be on the receiving end of a paternalistic relationship, no
matter how cozy the terms.  Just ask any teenager.<br><br>I see the disadvantages of the employer-employee relationship because
I've been on both sides of a better one: the investor-founder relationship.
I wouldn't claim it's painless.  When I was running a
startup, the thought of our investors used to keep me up at night.
And now that I'm an <a href="http://ycombinator.com">investor</a>,
the thought of our startups keeps me
up at night.  All the pain of whatever problem you're trying to
solve is still there.
But the pain hurts less when it isn't
mixed with resentment.<br><br>I had the misfortune to participate in what amounted to a controlled
experiment to prove that.  After Yahoo bought our startup I went
to work for them.  I was doing exactly the same work, except with
bosses.  And to my horror I started acting like a child.  The 
situation pushed buttons I'd forgotten
I had.<br><br>The big advantage of investment over employment, as the examples of open
source and blogging suggest, is that people working on projects of
their own are enormously more productive.  And a
<a href="start.html">startup</a> is a project
of one's own in two senses, both of them important: it's creatively
one's own, and also economically ones's own.<br><br>Google is a rare example of a big company in tune with the forces
I've described. They've tried hard to make their offices less sterile
than the usual cube farm.  They give employees who do great work
large grants of stock to simulate the rewards of a startup.  They
even let hackers spend 20% of their time on their own projects.<br><br>Why not let people spend 100% of their time on their own projects,
and instead of trying to approximate the value of what they create,
give them the actual market value?  Impossible?  That is in fact
what venture capitalists do.<br><br>So am I claiming that no one is going to be an employee anymore--
that everyone should go and start a startup?  Of course not.
But more people could do it than do it now.
At the moment, even the smartest students leave school thinking
they have to get a <a href="hiring.html">job</a>.  
Actually what they need to do is make
something valuable.  A job is one way to do that, but the more
ambitious ones will ordinarily be better off taking money from an
investor than an employer.<br><br>Hackers tend to think business is for MBAs.  But business
administration is not what you're doing in a startup.  What you're
doing is business <i>creation</i>.  And the first phase of that
is mostly product creation-- that is, hacking.  That's the
hard part.  It's a lot harder to create something people love than
to take something people love and figure out how to make money from
it.<br><br>Another thing that keeps people away from starting startups is the
risk.  Someone with kids and a mortgage should think twice before
doing it.  But most young hackers have neither.<br><br>And as the example of open source and blogging suggests, you'll
enjoy it more, even if you fail.  You'll be working on your own
thing, instead of going to some office and doing what you're told.
There may be more pain in your own company, but it won't hurt as
much.<br><br>That may be the greatest effect, in the long run, of the forces 
underlying open source and blogging: finally ditching the old
paternalistic employer-employee relationship, and replacing it with
a purely economic one, between equals.<br><br><br><br>

ladder.  That's less the rule now.  Our generation wants to get
paid up front.  Instead of developing a product for some big company
in the expectation of getting job security in return, we develop
the product ourselves, in a startup, and sell it to the big company.
At the very least we want options.<br><br>Among other things, this shift has created the appearance of a rapid
increase in economic inequality.  But really the two cases are not
as different as they look in economic statistics.<br><br>Economic statistics are misleading because they ignore the value
of safe jobs.  An easy job from which one can't be fired is worth
money; exchanging the two is one of the commonest forms of
corruption.  A sinecure is, in effect, an annuity.  Except sinecures
don't appear in economic statistics.  If they did, it would be clear
that in practice socialist countries have nontrivial disparities
of wealth, because they usually have a class of powerful bureaucrats
who are paid mostly by seniority and can never be fired.<br><br>While not a sinecure, a position on the corporate ladder was genuinely
valuable, because big companies tried not to fire people, and
promoted from within based largely on seniority.  A position on the
corporate ladder had a value analogous to the "goodwill" that is a
very real element in the valuation of companies.  It meant one could
expect future high paying jobs.<br><br>One of main causes of the decay of the corporate ladder is the trend
for takeovers that began in the 1980s.  Why waste your time climbing
a ladder that might disappear before you reach the top?<br><br>And, by no coincidence, the corporate ladder was one of the reasons
the early corporate raiders were so successful.  It's not only
economic statistics that ignore the value of safe jobs.  Corporate
balance sheets do too.  One reason it was profitable to carve up 1980s
companies and sell them for parts was that they hadn't formally
acknowledged their implicit debt to employees who had done good
work and expected to be rewarded with high-paying executive jobs
when their time came.<br><br>In the movie <i>Wall Street</i>, Gordon Gekko
ridicules a company overloaded with vice presidents.  But the company
may not be as corrupt as it seems; those VPs' cushy jobs were
probably payment for work done earlier.<br><br>I like the new model better.  For one thing, it seems a bad plan
to treat jobs as rewards.  Plenty of good engineers got made into
bad managers that way.  And the old system meant people had to deal
with a lot more corporate politics, in order to protect the work
they'd invested in a position on the ladder.<br><br>The big disadvantage of the new system is that it involves more <a href="inequality.html">risk</a>.  If you develop ideas in a startup instead
of within a big company, any number of random factors could sink
you before you can finish.  But maybe the older generation would
laugh at me for saying that the way we do things is riskier.  After
all, projects within big companies were always getting cancelled
as a result of arbitrary decisions from higher up.  My father's
entire industry (breeder reactors) disappeared that way.<br><br>For better or worse, the idea of the corporate ladder is probably
gone for good.  The new model seems more liquid, and more efficient.
But it is less of a change, financially, than one might think.  Our
fathers weren't <i>that</i> stupid.<br><br><br><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://ro.goobix.com/pg/ladder/">Romanian Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><center><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/7377b815404c2bf3bb137e8f5fa9e52e.gif" width="6" height="14" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></center></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/lionfan/20060111">Japanese Translation</a><br><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>
