</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
October 2008<br><br>The economic situation is apparently so grim that some experts fear
we may be in for a stretch as bad as the mid seventies.<br><br>When Microsoft and Apple were founded.<br><br>As those examples suggest, a recession may not be such a bad time
to start a startup.  I'm not claiming it's a particularly good time
either.  The truth is more boring: the state of the economy doesn't
matter much either way.<br><br>If we've learned one thing from funding so many startups, it's that
they succeed or fail based on the qualities of the founders.  The
economy has some effect, certainly, but as a predictor of success
it's rounding error compared to the founders.<br><br>Which means that what matters is who you are, not when you do it.
If you're the right sort of person, you'll win even in a bad economy.
And if you're not, a good economy won't save you.  Someone who
thinks "I better not start a startup now, because the economy is
so bad" is making the same mistake as the people who thought during
the Bubble "all I have to do is start a startup, and I'll be rich."<br><br>So if you want to improve your chances, you should think far more
about who you can recruit as a cofounder than the state of the
economy.  And if you're worried about threats to the survival of
your company, don't look for them in the news.  Look in the mirror.<br><br>But for any given team of founders, would it not pay to wait till
the economy is better before taking the leap?  If you're starting
a restaurant, maybe, but not if you're working on technology.
Technology progresses more or less independently of the stock market.
So for any given idea, the payoff for acting fast in a bad economy
will be higher than for waiting.  Microsoft's first product was a
Basic interpreter for the Altair.  That was exactly what the world
needed in 1975, but if Gates and Allen had decided to wait a few
years, it would have been too late.<br><br>Of course, the idea you have now won't be the last you have.  There
are always new ideas.  But if you have a specific idea you want to
act on, act now.<br><br>That doesn't mean you can ignore the economy.  Both customers and investors
will be feeling pinched.  It's not necessarily a problem if customers
feel pinched: you may even be able to benefit from it, by making
things that <a href="http://bountii.com">save money</a>.  
Startups often make things cheaper, so in
that respect they're better positioned to prosper in a recession
than big companies.<br><br>Investors are more of a problem.  Startups generally need to raise
some amount of external funding, and investors tend to be less
willing to invest in bad times.  They shouldn't be.  Everyone knows
you're supposed to buy when times are bad and sell when times are
good.  But of course what makes investing so counterintuitive is
that in equity markets, good times are defined as everyone thinking
it's time to buy.  You have to be a contrarian to be correct, and
by definition only a minority of investors can be.<br><br>So just as investors in 1999 were tripping over one another trying
to buy into lousy startups, investors in 2009 will presumably be
reluctant to invest even in good ones.<br><br>You'll have to adapt to this.  But that's nothing new: startups
always have to adapt to the whims of investors.  Ask any founder
in any economy if they'd describe investors as fickle, and watch
the face they make.  Last year you had to be prepared to explain
how your startup was viral.  Next year you'll have to explain how
it's recession-proof.<br><br>(Those are both good things to be.  The mistake investors make is
not the criteria they use but that they always tend to focus on one
to the exclusion of the rest.)<br><br>Fortunately the way to make a startup recession-proof is to do
exactly what you should do anyway: run it as cheaply as possible.
For years I've been telling founders that the surest route to success
is to be the cockroaches of the corporate world.  The immediate
cause of death in a startup is always running out of money. So the
cheaper your company is to operate, the harder it is to kill.
And fortunately it has gotten very cheap to run a startup. A recession
will if anything make it cheaper still.<br><br>If nuclear winter really is here, it may be safer to be a cockroach
even than to keep your job.  Customers may drop off individually
if they can no longer afford you, but you're not going to lose them
all at once; markets don't "reduce headcount."<br><br>What if you quit your job to start a startup that fails, and you
can't find another?  That could be a problem if you work in sales or
marketing.  In those fields it can take months to find a new
job in a bad economy.  But hackers seem to be more liquid.  Good
hackers can always get some kind of job.  It might not be your dream
job, but you're not going to starve.<br><br>Another advantage of bad times is that there's less competition.
Technology trains leave the station at regular intervals.  If 
everyone else is cowering in a corner, you may have a whole car to
yourself.<br><br>You're an investor too.  As a founder, you're buying stock with
work: the reason Larry and Sergey are so rich is not so much that
they've done work worth tens of billions of dollars, but that they
were the first investors in Google.  And like any investor you
should buy when times are bad.<br><br>Were you nodding in agreement, thinking "stupid investors" a few
paragraphs ago when I was talking about how investors are reluctant
to put money into startups in bad markets, even though that's the
time they should rationally be most willing to buy?  Well, founders
aren't much better.  When times get bad, hackers go to grad school.
And no doubt that will happen this time too.  In fact, what makes
the preceding paragraph true is that most readers won't believe
it—at least to the extent of acting on it.<br><br>So maybe a recession is a good time to start a startup.  It's hard
to say whether advantages like lack of competition outweigh
disadvantages like reluctant investors.  But it doesn't matter much
either way.   It's the people that matter.  And for a given set of
people working on a given technology, the time to act is always
now.<br><br></font></p></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://spring.jumpidea.com/2008/10/paul-graham-badeconomy.html">Russian Translation</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://medium.com/@Yangsupertramp/%E4%B8%BA%E5%95%A5%E8%A6%81%E5%9C%A8%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E4%B8%8D%E5%A5%BD%E7%9A%84%E6%97%B6%E5%80%99%E5%8E%BB%E5%88%9B%E4%B8%9A-c1412ca1d558">Chinese Translation</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://twitter.com/jackzhang904/status/1238388462887137285">Japanese Translation</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

big companies tend to have developed procedures to protect themselves
against mistakes.  A startup walks like a toddler, bashing
into things and falling over all the time.  A big company is more
deliberate.<br><br>The gradual accumulation of checks in an organization is a kind of
learning, based on disasters that have happened to it or others
like it.  After giving a contract to a supplier who goes bankrupt
and fails to deliver, for example, a company might require all
suppliers to prove they're solvent before submitting bids.<br><br>As companies grow they invariably get more such checks, either in
response to disasters they've suffered, or (probably more often)
by hiring people from bigger companies who bring with them customs
for protecting against new types of disasters.<br><br>It's natural for organizations to learn from mistakes.  The problem
is, people who propose new checks almost never consider that the
check itself has a cost.<br><br><i>Every check has a cost.</i> For example, consider the case of making
suppliers verify their solvency.  Surely that's mere prudence?  But
in fact it could have substantial costs.  There's obviously the
direct cost in time of the people on both sides who supply and check
proofs of the supplier's solvency.  But the real costs are the ones
you never hear about: the company that would be the best supplier,
but doesn't bid because they can't spare the effort to get verified.
Or the company that would be the best supplier, but falls just short
of the threshold for solvency—which will of course have been set
on the high side, since there is no apparent cost of increasing it.<br><br>Whenever someone in an organization proposes to add a new check,
they should have to explain not just the benefit but the cost.  No
matter how bad a job they did of analyzing it, this meta-check would
at least remind everyone there had to <i>be</i> a cost, and send them
looking for it.<br><br>If companies started doing that, they'd find some surprises.  Joel
Spolsky recently spoke at Y Combinator about selling software to
corporate customers.  He said that in most companies software costing
up to about $1000 could be bought by individual managers without
any additional approvals.  Above that threshold, software purchases
generally had to be approved by a committee.  But babysitting this
process was so expensive for software vendors that it didn't make
sense to charge less than $50,000.  Which means if you're making
something you might otherwise have charged $5000 for, you have to
sell it for $50,000 instead.<br><br>The purpose of the committee is presumably to ensure that the company
doesn't waste money. And yet the result is that the company pays
10 times as much.<br><br>Checks on purchases will always be expensive, because the harder
it is to sell something to you, the more it has to cost.  And not
merely linearly, either.  If you're hard enough to sell to, the
people who are best at making things don't want to bother.  The
only people who will sell to you are companies that specialize in
selling to you.  Then you've sunk to a whole new level of inefficiency.
Market mechanisms no longer protect you, because the good suppliers
are no longer in the market.<br><br>Such things happen constantly to the biggest organizations of all,
governments.  But checks instituted by governments can cause much
worse problems than merely overpaying.  Checks instituted by
governments can cripple a country's whole economy.  Up till about
1400, China was richer and more technologically advanced than Europe.
One reason Europe pulled ahead was that the Chinese government
restricted long trading voyages.  So it was left to the Europeans
to explore and eventually to dominate the rest of the world, including
China.<br><br>In more recent times, Sarbanes-Oxley has practically destroyed the
US IPO market.  That wasn't the intention of the legislators who
wrote it.  They just wanted to add a few more checks on public
companies.  But they forgot to consider the cost.  They forgot that
companies about to go public are usually rather stretched, and that
the weight of a few extra checks that might be easy for General
Electric to bear are enough to prevent younger companies from being
public at all.<br><br>Once you start to think about the cost of checks, you can start to
ask other interesting questions. Is the cost increasing or decreasing?
Is it higher in some areas than others?  Where does it increase
discontinuously?  If large organizations started to ask questions
like that, they'd learn some frightening things.<br><br>I think the cost of checks may actually be increasing.  The reason
is that software plays an increasingly important role in companies,
and the people who write software are particularly harmed by checks.<br><br>Programmers are unlike many types of workers in that the best ones
actually prefer to work hard.  This doesn't seem to be the case in
most types of work.  When I worked in fast food, we didn't prefer
the busy times.  And when I used to mow lawns, I definitely didn't
prefer it when the grass was long after a week of rain.<br><br>Programmers, though, like it better when they write more code.  Or
more precisely, when they release more code.  Programmers like to
make a difference.  Good ones, anyway.<br><br>For good programmers, one of the best things about working for a
startup is that there are few checks on releases.  In true startups,
there are no external checks at all.  If you have an idea for a new
feature in the morning, you can write it and push it to the production
servers before lunch.  And when you can do that, you have more
ideas.<br><br>At big companies, software has to go through various approvals
before it can be launched.  And the cost of doing this can be
enormous—in fact, discontinuous.  I was talking recently to a
group of three programmers whose startup had been acquired a few
years before by a big company.  When they'd been independent, they
could release changes instantly.  Now, they said, the absolute
fastest they could get code released on the production servers was
two weeks.<br><br>This didn't merely make them less productive.  It made them hate
working for the acquirer.<br><br>Here's a sign of how much programmers like to be able to work hard:
these guys would have <i>paid</i> to be able to release code immediately,
the way they used to.  I asked them if they'd trade 10% of the
acquisition price for the ability to release code immediately, and
all three instantly said yes.  Then I asked what was the maximum
percentage of the acquisition price they'd trade for it.  They said
they didn't want to think about it, because they didn't want to
know how high they'd go, but I got the impression it might be as
much as half.<br><br>They'd have sacrificed hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps
millions, just to be able to deliver more software to users.  And
you know what?  It would have been perfectly safe to let them.  In
fact, the acquirer would have been better off; not only wouldn't
these guys have broken anything, they'd have gotten a lot more done.
So the acquirer is in fact getting worse performance at greater
cost.  Just like the committee approving software purchases.<br><br>And just as the greatest danger of being hard to sell to is not
that you overpay but that the best suppliers won't even sell to
you, the greatest danger of applying too many checks to your
programmers is not that you'll make them unproductive, but that
good programmers won't even want to work for you.<br><br>Steve Jobs's famous maxim "artists ship" works both ways.  Artists
aren't merely capable of shipping.  They insist on it.  So if you
don't let people ship, you won't have any artists.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

to its ability to assemble large and disciplined organizations.
Those who bet on economies of scale generally won, which meant the
largest organizations were the most successful ones.<br><br>Things have already changed so much that this is hard for us to
believe, but till just a few decades ago the largest organizations
tended to be the most progressive.  An ambitious kid graduating
from college in 1960 wanted to work in the huge, gleaming offices
of Ford, or General Electric, or NASA.  Small meant small-time.
Small in 1960 didn't mean a cool little startup.  It meant uncle
Sid's shoe store.<br><br>When I grew up in the 1970s, the idea of the "corporate ladder" was
still very much alive.  The standard plan was to try to get into a
good college, from which one would be drafted into some organization
and then rise to positions of gradually increasing responsibility.
The more ambitious merely hoped to climb the same ladder faster.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>But in the late twentieth century something changed.  It turned out
that economies of scale were not the only force at work.  Particularly
in technology, the increase in speed one could get from smaller
groups started to trump the advantages of size.<br><br>The future turned out to be different from the one we were expecting
in 1970.  The domed cities and flying cars we expected have failed
to materialize.  But fortunately so have the jumpsuits with badges
indicating our specialty and rank.  Instead of being dominated by
a few, giant tree-structured organizations, it's now looking like
the economy of the future will be a fluid network of smaller,
independent units.<br><br>It's not so much that large organizations stopped working.  There's
no evidence that famously successful organizations like the Roman
army or the British East India Company were any less afflicted by
protocol and politics than organizations of the same size today.
But they were competing against opponents who couldn't change the
rules on the fly by discovering new technology.  Now it turns out
the rule "large and disciplined organizations win" needs to have a
qualification appended: "at games that change slowly." No one knew
till change reached a sufficient speed.<br><br>Large organizations <i>will</i> start to do worse now, though,
because for the first time in history they're no longer getting the
best people.  An ambitious kid graduating from college now doesn't
want to work for a big company.  They want to work for the hot
startup that's rapidly growing into one.  If they're really ambitious,
they want to start it. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>This doesn't mean big companies will disappear.  To say that
startups will succeed implies that big companies will exist, because
startups that succeed either become big companies or are acquired
by them. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
But large organizations will probably never again
play the leading role they did up till the last quarter of the
twentieth century.<br><br>It's kind of surprising that a trend that lasted so long would ever
run out.  How often does it happen that a rule works for thousands
of years, then switches polarity?<br><br>The millennia-long run of bigger-is-better left us with a lot of
<a href="credentials.html">traditions</a> that are now obsolete, 
but extremely deeply rooted.
Which means the ambitious can now do arbitrage on them.  It will
be very valuable to understand precisely which ideas to keep and
which can now be discarded.<br><br>The place to look is where the spread of smallness began: in the
world of startups.<br><br>There have always been occasional cases, particularly in the US,
of ambitious people who grew the ladder under them instead of
climbing it.  But till recently this was an anomalous route that
tended to be followed only by outsiders.  It was no coincidence
that the great industrialists of the nineteenth century had so
little formal education.  As huge as their companies eventually
became, they were all essentially mechanics and shopkeepers at
first.  That was a social step no one with a college education would
take if they could avoid it.  Till the rise of technology startups,
and in particular, Internet startups, it was very unusual for
educated people to start their own businesses.<br><br>The eight men who left Shockley Semiconductor to found Fairchild
Semiconductor, the original Silicon Valley startup, weren't even
trying to start a company at first.  They were just looking for a
company willing to hire them as a group.  Then one of their parents
introduced them to a small investment bank that offered to find
funding for them to start their own, so they did.  But starting a
company was an alien idea to them; it was something they backed
into.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Now I would guess that practically every Stanford or Berkeley
undergrad who knows how to program has at least considered the idea
of starting a startup.  East Coast universities are not far behind,
and British universities only a little behind them.  This pattern
suggests that attitudes at Stanford and Berkeley are not an anomaly,
but a leading indicator.  This is the way the world is going.<br><br>Of course, Internet startups are still only a fraction of the world's
economy.  Could a trend based on them be that powerful?<br><br>I think so.  There's no reason to suppose there's any limit to the
amount of work that could be done in this area.  Like science,
wealth seems to expand fractally.  Steam power was a sliver of the
British economy when Watt started working on it.  But his work led
to more work till that sliver had expanded into something bigger
than the whole economy of which it had initially been a part.<br><br>The same thing could happen with the Internet.  If Internet startups
offer the best opportunity for ambitious people, then a lot of
ambitious people will start them, and this bit of the economy will
balloon in the usual fractal way.<br><br>Even if Internet-related applications only become a tenth of the
world's economy, this component will set the tone for the rest.
The most dynamic part of the economy always does, in everything
from salaries to standards of dress.  Not just because of its
prestige, but because the principles underlying the most dynamic
part of the economy tend to be ones that work.<br><br>For the future, the trend to bet on seems to be networks of small,
autonomous groups whose performance is measured individually.  And
the societies that win will be the ones with the least impedance.<br><br>As with the original industrial revolution, some societies are going
to be better at this than others.  Within a generation of its birth
in England, the Industrial Revolution had spread to continental
Europe and North America.  But it didn't spread everywhere.  This
new way of doing things could only take root in places that were
prepared for it.  It could only spread to places that already had
a vigorous middle class.<br><br>There is a similar social component to the transformation that began
in Silicon Valley in the 1960s.  Two new kinds of techniques were
developed there: techniques for building integrated circuits, and
techniques for building a new type of company designed to grow fast
by creating new technology.  The techniques for building integrated
circuits spread rapidly to other countries.  But the techniques for
building startups didn't.  Fifty years later, startups are ubiquitous
in Silicon Valley and common in a handful of other US cities, but
they're still an anomaly in most of the world.<br><br>Part of the reason—possibly the main reason—that startups
have not spread as broadly as the Industrial Revolution did is their
social disruptiveness.  Though it brought many social changes, the
Industrial Revolution was not fighting the principle that bigger
is better.  Quite the opposite: the two dovetailed beautifully.
The new industrial companies adapted the customs of existing large
organizations like the military and the civil service, and the
resulting hybrid worked well.  "Captains of industry" issued orders
to "armies of workers," and everyone knew what they were supposed
to do.<br><br>Startups seem to go more against the grain, socially.  It's hard
for them to flourish in societies that value hierarchy and stability,
just as it was hard for industrialization to flourish in societies
ruled by people who stole at will from the merchant class.  But
there were already a handful of countries past that stage when the
Industrial Revolution happened.   There do not seem to be that many
ready this time.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

One of the bizarre consequences of this model was that the usual
way to make more money was to become a manager.  This is one of the
things startups fix.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]

doing so much worse than Japanese car companies, but at least one

It's possible that companies will one day be able to grow big

a report about entrepreneurship.  Unfortunately after reading it
they decided  it was too controversial to include.)</i><br><br>
VC funding will probably dry up somewhat during the present recession,
like it usually does in bad times.  But this time the result may
be different.  This time the number of new startups may not decrease.
And that could be dangerous for VCs.<br><br>When VC funding dried up after the Internet Bubble, startups dried
up too.   There were not a lot of new startups being founded in
2003.  But startups aren't tied to VC the way they were 10 years
ago.  It's now possible for VCs and startups to diverge.  And if
they do, they may not reconverge once the economy gets better.<br><br>The reason startups no longer depend so much on VCs is one that
everyone in the startup business knows by now: it has gotten much
cheaper to start a startup.  There are four main reasons: Moore's
law has made hardware cheap; open source has made software free;
the web has made marketing and distribution free; and more powerful
programming languages mean development teams can be smaller.  These
changes have pushed the cost of starting a startup down into the
noise.  In a lot of startups—probaby most startups funded by
Y Combinator—the biggest expense is simply the founders'
living expenses.  We've had startups that were profitable on revenues
of $3000 a month.<br><br>$3000 is insignificant as revenues go.  Why should anyone care about
a startup making $3000 a month?  Because, although insignificant
as <i>revenue</i>, this amount of money can change a startup's
<i>funding</i> situation completely.<br><br>Someone running a startup is always calculating in the back of their
mind how much "runway" they have—how long they have till the
money in the bank runs out and they either have to be profitable,
raise more money, or go out of business.  Once you cross the threshold
of profitability, however low, your runway becomes infinite.  It's
a qualitative change, like the stars turning into lines and
disappearing when the Enterprise accelerates to warp speed.  Once
you're profitable you don't need investors' money.  And because
Internet startups have become so cheap to run, the threshold of
profitability can be trivially low.  Which means many Internet
startups don't need VC-scale investments anymore.  For many startups,
VC funding has, in the language of VCs, gone from a must-have to a
nice-to-have.<br><br>This change happened while no one was looking, and its effects have
been largely masked so far.  It was during the trough after the
Internet Bubble that it became trivially cheap to start a startup,
but few realized it because startups were so out of fashion.   When
startups came back into fashion, around 2005, investors were starting
to write checks again.  And while founders may not have needed VC
money the way they used to, they were willing to take it if
offered—partly because there was a tradition of startups
taking VC money, and partly because startups, like dogs, tend to
eat when given the opportunity.  As long as VCs were writing checks,
founders were never forced to explore the limits of how little they
needed them.  There were a few startups who hit these limits
accidentally because of their unusual circumstances—most
famously 37signals, which hit the limit because they crossed into
startup land from the other direction: they started as a consulting
firm, so they had revenue before they had a product.<br><br>VCs and founders are like two components that used to be bolted
together.  Around 2000 the bolt was removed.  Because the components
have so far been subjected to the same forces, they still seem to
be joined together, but really one is just resting on the other.
A sharp impact would make them fly apart.  And the present recession
could be that impact.<br><br>Because of Y Combinator's position at the extreme end of the spectrum,
we'd be the first to see signs of a separation between founders and
investors, and we are in fact seeing it.  For example, though the
stock market crash does seem to have made investors more cautious,
it doesn't seem to have had any effect on the number of people who
want to start startups.  We take applications for funding every 6
months.  Applications for the current funding cycle closed on October
17, well after the markets tanked, and even so we got a record
number, up 40% from the same cycle a year before.<br><br>Maybe things will be different a year from now, if the economy
continues to get worse, but so far there is zero slackening of
interest among potential founders.  That's different from the way
things felt in 2001.  Then there was a widespread feeling among
potential founders that startups were over, and that one should
just go to grad school.   That isn't happening this time, and part
of the reason is that even in a bad economy it's not that hard to
build something that makes $3000 a month.  If investors stop writing
checks, who cares?<br><br>We also see signs of a divergence between founders and investors
in the attitudes of existing startups we've funded.  I was talking
to one recently that had a round fall through at the last minute
over the sort of trifle that breaks deals when investors feel they
have the upper hand—over an uncertainty about whether the
founders had correctly filed their 83(b) forms, if you can believe
that.  And yet this startup is obviously going to succeed: their
traffic and revenue graphs look like a jet taking off.  So I asked
them if they wanted me to introduce them to more investors.  To my
surprise, they said no—that they'd just spent four months
dealing with investors, and they were actually a lot happier now
that they didn't have to.  There was a friend they wanted to hire
with the investor money, and now they'd have to postpone that.  But
otherwise they felt they had enough in the bank to make it to
profitability.  To make sure, they were moving to a cheaper apartment.
And in this economy I bet they got a good deal on it.<br><br>I've detected this "investors aren't worth the trouble" vibe from
several YC founders I've talked to recently.  At least one startup
from the most recent (summer) cycle may not even raise angel money,
let alone VC.  <a href="http://ticketstumbler.com">Ticketstumbler</a>
made it to profitability on Y Combinator's $15,000 investment and
they hope not to need more.  This surprised even us.  Although YC
is based on the idea of it being cheap to start a startup, we never
anticipated that founders would grow successful startups on nothing
more than YC funding.<br><br>If founders decide VCs aren't worth the trouble, that could be bad
for VCs.  When the economy bounces back in a few years and they're
ready to write checks again, they may find that founders have moved
on.<br><br>There is a founder community just as there's a VC community.  They
all know one another, and techniques spread rapidly between them.
If one tries a new programming language or a new hosting provider
and gets good results, 6 months later half of them are using it.
And the same is true for funding.  The current generation of founders
want to raise money from VCs, and Sequoia specifically, because
Larry and Sergey took money from VCs, and Sequoia specifically.
Imagine what it would do to the VC business if the next hot company
didn't take VC at all.<br><br>VCs think they're playing a zero sum game.  In fact, it's not even
that.  If you lose a deal to Benchmark, you lose that deal, but VC
as an industry still wins.  If you lose a deal to None, all VCs
lose.<br><br>This recession may be different from the one after the Internet
Bubble.  This time founders may keep starting startups.  And if
they do, VCs will have to keep writing checks, or they could become

Korean cram schools that said <blockquote>
  Admission to the right university can make or break an ambitious
  young South Korean.
</blockquote> A parent added: <blockquote>
  "In our country, college entrance exams determine 70 to 80 percent
  of a person's future."
</blockquote> It was striking how old fashioned this sounded.  And
yet when I was in high school it wouldn't have seemed too far off
as a description of the US.  Which means things must have been
changing here.<br><br>The course of people's lives in the US now seems to be determined
less by credentials and more by performance than it was 25 years
ago.  Where you go to college still matters, but not like it used
to.<br><br>What happened?<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Judging people by their academic credentials was in its time an
advance.  The practice seems to have begun in China, where starting
in 587 candidates for the imperial civil service had to take an
exam on classical literature.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font> It was also a test of wealth,
because the knowledge it tested was so specialized that passing
required years of expensive training.  But though wealth was a
necessary condition for passing, it was not a sufficient one.  By
the standards of the rest of the world in 587, the Chinese system
was very enlightened.  Europeans didn't introduce formal civil
service exams till the nineteenth century, and even then they seem
to have been influenced by the Chinese example.<br><br>Before credentials, government positions were obtained mainly by
family influence, if not outright bribery.   It was a great step
forward to judge people by their performance on a test.  But by no
means a perfect solution.  When you judge people that way, you tend
to get cram schools—which they did in Ming China and nineteenth
century England just as much as in present day South Korea.<br><br>What cram schools are, in effect, is leaks in a seal.  The use of
credentials
was an attempt to seal off the direct transmission of power between
generations, and cram schools represent that power finding holes
in the seal.  Cram schools turn wealth in one generation into
credentials in the next.<br><br>It's hard to beat this phenomenon, because the schools adjust to suit
whatever the tests measure.  When the tests are narrow and
predictable, you get cram schools on the classic model, like those
that prepared candidates for Sandhurst (the British West Point) or
the classes American students take now to improve their SAT scores.
But as the tests get broader, the schools do too.  Preparing a
candidate for the Chinese imperial civil service exams took years,
as prep school does today.  But the raison d'etre of all these
institutions has been the same: to beat the system.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>History suggests that, all other things being equal, a society
prospers in proportion to its ability to prevent parents from
influencing their children's success directly.  It's a fine thing
for parents to help their children indirectly—for example,
by helping them to become smarter or more disciplined, which then
makes them more successful.  The problem comes when parents use
direct methods: when they are able to use their own wealth or power
as a substitute for their children's qualities.<br><br>Parents will tend to do this when they can.  Parents will die for
their kids, so it's not surprising to find they'll also push their
scruples to the limits for them.  Especially if other parents are
doing it.<br><br>Sealing off this force has a double advantage.  Not only does a
society get "the best man for the job," but
parents' ambitions are diverted from direct methods to indirect
ones—to actually trying to raise their kids well.<br><br>But we should expect it to be very hard to contain parents' efforts
to obtain an unfair advantage for their kids.  We're dealing with
one of the most powerful forces in human nature.  We shouldn't expect
naive solutions to work, any more than we'd expect naive solutions
for keeping heroin out of a prison to work.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>The obvious way to solve the problem is to make credentials better.
If the tests a society uses are currently hackable, we can study
the way people beat them and try to plug the holes.  You can use
the cram schools to show you where most of the holes are.  They
also tell you when you're succeeding in fixing them: when cram
schools become less popular.<br><br>A more general solution
would be to push for increased transparency, especially at critical
social bottlenecks like college admissions.  In the US this process
still shows many outward signs of corruption.  For example, legacy
admissions.  The official story is that legacy status doesn't carry
much weight, because all it does is break ties: applicants are
bucketed by ability, and legacy status is only used to decide between
the applicants in the bucket that straddles the cutoff.  But what
this means is that a university can make legacy status have as much
or as little weight as they want, by adjusting the size of the
bucket that straddles the cutoff.<br><br>By gradually chipping away at the abuse of credentials, you could
probably make them more airtight.  But what a long fight it would
be.  Especially when the institutions administering the tests don't
really want them to be airtight.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Fortunately there's a better way to prevent the direct transmission
of power between generations.  Instead of trying to make credentials
harder to hack, we can also make them matter less.<br><br>Let's think about what credentials are for.  What they are,
functionally, is a way of predicting performance.  If you could
measure actual performance, you wouldn't need them.<br><br>So why did they even evolve?  Why haven't we just been measuring
actual performance?  Think about where credentialism first appeared:
in selecting candidates for large organizations.  Individual
performance is hard to measure in large organizations, and the
harder performance is to measure, the more important it is
to predict it.  If an organization could immediately and cheaply
measure the performance of recruits, they wouldn't need to examine
their credentials.  They could take everyone and keep just the good
ones.<br><br>Large organizations can't do this.  But a bunch of small organizations
in a market can come close.  A market takes every organization and
keeps just the good ones.  As organizations get smaller, this
approaches taking every person and keeping just the good ones.  So
all other things being equal, a society consisting of more, smaller
organizations will care less about credentials.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>That's what's been happening in the US.  That's why those quotes
from Korea sound so old fashioned.  They're talking about an economy
like America's a few decades ago, dominated by a few big companies.
The route for the ambitious in that sort of environment is to join
one and climb to the top.  Credentials matter a lot then.  In the 
culture of a large organization, an elite pedigree becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy.<br><br>This doesn't work in small companies.  Even if your colleagues were
impressed by your credentials, they'd soon be parted from you if
your performance didn't match, because the company would go out of
business and the people would be dispersed.<br><br>In a world of small companies, performance is all anyone cares
about.  People hiring for a startup don't care whether you've even
graduated from college, let alone which one.  All they care about
is what you can do.  Which is in fact all that should matter, even
in a large organization.  The reason credentials have such prestige
is that for so long the large organizations
in a society tended to be the most powerful.  But in the US at least
they don't have the monopoly on power they once did, precisely
because they can't measure (and thus reward) individual performance.
Why spend twenty years climbing the corporate ladder when you can
get rewarded directly by the market?<br><br>I realize I see a more exaggerated version of the change than most
other people.  As a partner at an early stage venture funding firm,
I'm like a jumpmaster shoving people out of the old world of
credentials and into the new one of performance.  I'm an agent of
the change I'm seeing.  But I don't think I'm imagining it.  It was
not so easy 25 years ago for an ambitious person to choose to be
judged directly by the market.  You had to go through bosses, and
they were influenced by where you'd been to college.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>What made it possible for small organizations to succeed in America?
I'm still not entirely sure.  Startups are certainly a large part
of it.  Small organizations can develop new ideas faster than large
ones, and new ideas are increasingly valuable.<br><br>But I don't think startups account for all the shift from credentials
to measurement.  My friend Julian Weber told me that when he went
to work for a New York law firm in the 1950s they paid associates
far less than firms do today.  Law firms then made no pretense of
paying people according to the value of the work they'd done.  Pay
was based on seniority.  The younger employees were paying their
dues.  They'd be rewarded later.<br><br>The same principle prevailed at industrial companies.  When my
father was working at Westinghouse in the 1970s, he had people
working for him who made more than he did, because they'd been there
longer.<br><br>Now companies increasingly have to pay employees market price for
the work they do.   One reason is that employees no longer trust
companies to deliver 
<a href="ladder.html">deferred rewards</a>: why work to accumulate
deferred rewards at a company that might go bankrupt, or be taken
over and have all its implicit obligations wiped out?  The other
is that some companies broke ranks and started to pay young employees
large amounts.  This was particularly true in consulting, law, and
finance, where it led to the phenomenon of yuppies.  The word is
rarely used today because it's no longer surprising to see a 25
year old with money, but in 1985 the sight of a 25 year old
<i>professional</i> able to afford a new BMW was so novel that it
called forth a new word.<br><br>The classic yuppie worked for a small organization.  He didn't work
for General Widget, but for the law firm that handled General
Widget's acquisitions or the investment bank that floated their
bond issues.<br><br>Startups and yuppies entered the American conceptual vocabulary
roughly simultaneously in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  I don't
think there was a causal connection.  Startups happened because
technology started to change so fast that big companies could no
longer keep a lid on the smaller ones.  I don't think the rise of
yuppies was inspired by it; it seems more as if there was a change
in the social conventions (and perhaps the laws) governing the way
big companies worked.  But the two phenomena rapidly fused to produce
a principle that now seems obvious: paying energetic young people
market rates, and getting correspondingly high performance from
them.<br><br>At about the same time the US economy rocketed out of the doldrums
that had afflicted it for most of the 1970s.  Was there a connection?
I don't know enough to say, but it felt like it at the time.  There
was a lot of energy released.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Countries worried about their competitiveness are right to be
concerned about the number of startups started within them.  But
they would do even better to examine the underlying principle.  Do
they let energetic young people get paid market rate for the work
they do?  The young are the test, because when people aren't rewarded
according to performance, they're invariably rewarded according to
seniority instead.<br><br>All it takes is a few beachheads in your economy that pay for
performance.  Measurement spreads like heat.  If one part of a
society is better at measurement than others, it tends to push the
others to do better.  If people who are young but smart and driven
can make more by starting their own companies than by working for
existing ones, the existing companies are forced to pay more to
keep them.  So market rates gradually permeate every organization,
even the government.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The measurement of performance will tend to push even the organizations
issuing credentials into line.  When we were kids I used to annoy
my sister by ordering her to do things I knew she was about to do
anyway.  As credentials are superseded by performance, a similar
role is the best former gatekeepers can hope for.  Once credential
granting institutions are no longer in the self-fullfilling prophecy
business, they'll have to work harder to predict the future.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>Credentials are a step beyond bribery and influence.  But they're
not the final step.  There's an even better way to block the
transmission of power between generations: to encourage the trend
toward an economy made of more, smaller units.  Then you can measure
what credentials merely predict.<br><br>No one likes the transmission of power between generations—not
the left or the right.  But the market forces favored by the right
turn out to be a better way of preventing it than the credentials
the left are forced to fall back on.<br><br>The era of credentials began to end when the power of large
organizations <a href="highres.html">peaked</a> 
in the late twentieth century.  Now we seem
to be entering a new era based on measurement.  The reason the new
model has advanced so rapidly is that it works so much better.  It
shows no sign of slowing.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] Miyazaki, Ichisada

uniquely useless discussions.<br><br>As a rule, any mention of religion on an online forum degenerates
into a religious argument.  Why?  Why does this happen with religion
and not with Javascript or baking or other topics people talk about
on forums?<br><br>What's different about religion is that people don't feel they need
to have any particular expertise to have opinions about
it.  All they need is strongly held beliefs, and anyone can have
those.  No thread about Javascript will grow as fast as one about
religion, because people feel they have to be over some threshold
of expertise to post comments about that.  But on religion everyone's
an expert.<br><br>Then it struck me: this is the problem with politics too.  Politics,
like religion, is a topic where there's no threshold of expertise
for expressing an opinion.  All you need is strong convictions.<br><br>Do religion and politics have something in common that explains
this similarity?  One possible explanation is that they deal with
questions that have no definite answers, so there's no back pressure
on people's opinions.  Since no one can be proven wrong, every
opinion is equally valid, and sensing this, everyone lets fly with
theirs.<br><br>But this isn't true.  There are certainly some political questions
that have definite answers, like how much a new government policy
will cost.  But the more precise political questions suffer the
same fate as the vaguer ones.<br><br>I think what religion and politics have in common is that they
become part of people's identity, and people can never have a
fruitful argument about something that's part of their identity.
By definition they're partisan.<br><br>Which topics engage people's identity depends on the people, not
the topic.  For example, a discussion about a battle that included
citizens of one or more of the countries involved would probably
degenerate into a political argument.  But a discussion today about
a battle that took place in the Bronze Age probably wouldn't.  No
one would know what side to be on.  So it's not politics that's the
source of the trouble, but identity.  When people say a discussion
has degenerated into a religious war, what they really mean is that
it has started to be driven mostly by people's identities.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Because the point at which this happens depends on the people rather
than the topic, it's a mistake to conclude that because a question
tends to provoke religious wars, it must have no answer. For example,
the question of the relative merits of programming languages often
degenerates into a religious war, because so many programmers
identify as X programmers or Y programmers.  This sometimes leads
people to conclude the question must be unanswerable—that all
languages are equally good.  Obviously that's false: anything else
people make can be well or badly designed; why should this be
uniquely impossible for programming languages?  And indeed, you can
have a fruitful discussion about the relative merits of programming
languages, so long as you exclude people who respond from identity.<br><br>More generally, you can have a fruitful discussion about a topic
only if it doesn't engage the identities of any of the
participants.  What makes politics and religion such minefields is
that they engage so many people's identities.  But you could in
principle have a useful conversation about them with some people.
And there are other topics that might seem harmless, like the
relative merits of Ford and Chevy pickup trucks, that you couldn't
safely talk about with <a href="http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060418/NEWS/604180378/1039">others</a>.<br><br>The most intriguing thing about this theory, if it's right, is that
it explains not merely which kinds of discussions to avoid, but how
to have better ideas.  If people can't think clearly about anything
that has become part of their identity, then all other things being
equal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as
possible. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Most people reading this will already be fairly tolerant.  But there
is a step beyond thinking of yourself as x but tolerating y: not
even to consider yourself an x.  The more labels you have for
yourself, the dumber they make you.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
When that happens, it tends to happen fast, like a core going
critical.  The threshold for participating goes down to zero, which
brings in more people.  And they tend to say incendiary things,
which draw more and angrier counterarguments.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There may be some things it's a net win to include in your
identity.  For example, being a scientist.  But arguably that is
more of a placeholder than an actual label—like putting NMI on a
form that asks for your middle initial—because it doesn't commit
you to believing anything in particular.   A scientist isn't committed
to believing in natural selection in the same way a biblical
literalist is committed to rejecting it.  All he's committed to is
following the evidence wherever it leads.<br><br>Considering yourself a scientist is equivalent to putting a sign
in a cupboard saying "this cupboard must be kept empty."  Yes,
strictly speaking, you're putting something in the cupboard, but
not in the ordinary sense.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, and Robert

February 2009<br><br>One of the things I always tell startups is a principle I learned
from Paul Buchheit: it's better to make a few people really happy
than to make a lot of people semi-happy.  I was saying recently to
a reporter that if I could only tell startups 10 things, this would
be one of them.  Then I thought: what would the other 9 be?<br><br>When I made the list there turned out to be 13:
</p><p style="margin-top:32px">
<b>1. Pick good cofounders.</b><br><br>Cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate.  You
can change anything about a house except where it is.  In a startup
you can change your idea easily, but changing your cofounders is
hard. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
And the success of a startup is almost always a function
of its founders.<br><br><b>2. Launch fast.</b><br><br>The reason to launch fast is not so much that it's critical to get
your product to market early, but that you haven't really started
working on it till you've launched.  Launching teaches you what you
should have been building.  Till you know that you're wasting your
time.  So the main value of whatever you launch with is as a pretext
for engaging users.<br><br><b>3. Let your idea evolve.</b><br><br>This is the second half of launching fast. Launch fast and iterate.
It's a big mistake to treat a startup as if it were merely a matter
of implementing some brilliant initial idea. As in an essay, most
of the ideas appear in the implementing.<br><br><b>4. Understand your users.</b><br><br>You can envision the wealth created by a startup as a rectangle,
where one side is the number of users and the other is how much you
improve their lives.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
The second dimension is the one you have
most control over.  And indeed, the growth in the first will be
driven by how well you do in the second.  As in science, the hard
part is not answering questions but asking them: the hard part is
seeing something new that users lack. The better you understand
them the better the odds of doing that. That's why so many successful
startups make something the founders needed.<br><br><b>5. Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent.</b><br><br>Ideally you want to make large numbers of users love you, but you
can't expect to hit that right away.  Initially you have to choose
between satisfying all the needs of a subset of potential users,
or satisfying a subset of the needs of all potential users.  Take
the first. It's easier to expand userwise than satisfactionwise.
And perhaps more importantly, it's harder to lie to yourself.  If
you think you're 85% of the way to a great product, how do you know
it's not 70%?  Or 10%?  Whereas it's easy to know how many users
you have.<br><br><b>6. Offer surprisingly good customer service.</b><br><br>Customers are used to being maltreated.  Most of the companies they
deal with are quasi-monopolies that get away with atrocious customer
service. Your own ideas about what's possible have been unconsciously
lowered by such experiences.  Try making your customer service not
merely good, but 
<a href="http://www.diaryofawebsite.com/blog/2008/07/wufoo-and-the-art-of-customer-service/">surprisingly good</a>.  Go out of your way to make
people happy.  They'll be overwhelmed; you'll see.  In the earliest
stages of a startup, it pays to offer customer service on a level
that wouldn't scale, because it's a way of learning about your
users.<br><br><b>7. You make what you measure.</b><br><br>I learned this one from Joe Kraus. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Merely measuring something
has an uncanny tendency to improve it.  If you want to make your
user numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and every
day plot the number of users.  You'll be delighted when it goes up
and disappointed when it goes down.  Pretty soon you'll start
noticing what makes the number go up, and you'll start to do more
of that.  Corollary: be careful what you measure.<br><br><b>8. Spend little.</b><br><br>I can't emphasize enough how important it is for a startup to be cheap.
Most startups fail before they make something people want, and the
most common form of failure is running out of money.  So being cheap
is (almost) interchangeable with iterating rapidly.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
But it's
more than that.  A culture of cheapness keeps companies young in
something like the way exercise keeps people young.<br><br><b>9. Get ramen profitable.</b><br><br>"Ramen profitable" means a startup makes just enough to pay the
founders' living expenses.  It's not rapid prototyping for business
models (though it can be), but more a way of hacking the investment
process.  Once you cross over into ramen profitable, it completely
changes your relationship with investors.  It's also great for
morale.<br><br><b>10. Avoid distractions.</b><br><br>Nothing kills startups like distractions.  The worst type are those
that pay money: day jobs, consulting, profitable side-projects.
The startup may have more long-term potential, but you'll always
interrupt working on it to answer calls from people paying you now.
Paradoxically, <a href="fundraising.html">fundraising</a> is this type of distraction, so try to
minimize that too.<br><br><b>11. Don't get demoralized.</b><br><br>Though the immediate cause of death in a startup tends to be running
out of money, the underlying cause is usually lack of focus.  Either
the company is run by stupid people (which can't be fixed with
advice) or the people are smart but got demoralized.  Starting a
startup is a huge moral weight.  Understand this and make a conscious
effort not to be ground down by it, just as you'd be careful to
bend at the knees when picking up a heavy box.<br><br><b>12. Don't give up.</b><br><br>Even if you get demoralized, <a href="die.html">don't give up</a>.  You can get surprisingly
far by just not giving up.  This isn't true in all fields.  There
are a lot of people who couldn't become good mathematicians no
matter how long they persisted.  But startups aren't like that.
Sheer effort is usually enough, so long as you keep morphing your
idea.<br><br><b>13. Deals fall through.</b><br><br>One of the most useful skills we learned from Viaweb was not getting
our hopes up.  We probably had 20 deals of various types fall
through.  After the first 10 or so we learned to treat deals as
background processes that we should ignore till they terminated.
It's very dangerous to morale to start to depend on deals closing,
not just because they so often don't, but because it makes them
less likely to.
</p></font><p style="margin-top:32px"><font size="2" face="verdana">
Having gotten it down to 13 sentences, I asked myself which I'd
choose if I could only keep one.<br><br>Understand your users.  That's the key.  The essential task in a
startup is to create wealth; the dimension of wealth you have most
control over is how much you improve users' lives; and the hardest
part of that is knowing what to make for them.  Once you know what
to make, it's mere effort to make it, and most decent hackers are
capable of that.<br><br>Understanding your users is part of half the principles in this
list.  That's the reason to launch early, to understand your users.
Evolving your idea is the embodiment of understanding your users.
Understanding your users well will tend to push you toward making
something that makes a few people deeply happy.  The most important
reason for having surprisingly good customer service is that it
helps you understand your users.  And understanding your users will
even ensure your morale, because when everything else is collapsing
around you, having just ten users who love you will keep you going.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Strictly speaking it's impossible without a time machine.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In practice it's more like a ragged comb.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Joe thinks one of the founders of Hewlett Packard said it first,
but he doesn't remember which.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
They'd be interchangeable if markets stood still.  Since they
don't, working twice as fast is better than having twice as much
time.<br><br></font></p></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/45089fb46718e73fca9f938ed7f81610.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://blog.tayfunsen.com/2009/05/13-cumlede-startuplar.html">Turkish Translation</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/45089fb46718e73fca9f938ed7f81610.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.recursosparapymes.com/las-13-cosas-que-paul-graham-le-diria-a-un-emprendedor/">Spanish Translation</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/45089fb46718e73fca9f938ed7f81610.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://www.entrepreneur.bg/7301/dobriyat-startap-v-13-izrecheniya/">Bulgarian Translation</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/45089fb46718e73fca9f938ed7f81610.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://note.com/tokyojack/n/nb5598e41a3c0">Japanese Translation</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/45089fb46718e73fca9f938ed7f81610.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://virgool.io/@mahdikhashan/%D9%BE%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84-%DA%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%BE-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%B2%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%84%D9%87-gduckqxgkoe6">Persian Translation</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div>

old last week.  Initially it was supposed to be a side project—an
application to sharpen Arc on, and a place for current and future
Y Combinator founders to exchange news.  It's grown bigger and taken
up more time than I expected, but I don't regret that because I've
learned so much from working on it.<br><br><b>Growth</b><br><br>When we launched in February 2007, weekday traffic was around 1600
daily uniques.  It's since <a href="http://ycombinator.com/images/2yeartraffic.png">grown</a> to around 22,000.  This growth
rate is a bit higher than I'd like.  I'd like the site to grow,
since a site that isn't growing at least slowly is probably dead.
But I wouldn't want it to grow as large as Digg or Reddit—mainly
because that would dilute the character of the site, but also because
I don't want to spend all my time dealing with scaling.<br><br>I already have problems enough with that.  Remember, the original
motivation for HN was to test a new programming language, and
moreover one that's focused on experimenting with language design,
not performance.  Every time the site gets slow, I fortify myself
by recalling McIlroy and Bentley's famous quote
<blockquote>
  The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special
  cases.
</blockquote>
and look for the bottleneck I can remove with least code.  So far
I've been able to keep up, in the sense that performance has remained
consistently mediocre despite 14x growth. I don't know what I'll
do next, but I'll probably think of something.<br><br>This is my attitude to the site generally.  Hacker News is an
experiment, and an experiment in a very young field.  Sites of this
type are only a few years old.  Internet conversation generally is
only a few decades old.  So we've probably only discovered a fraction
of what we eventually will.<br><br>That's why I'm so optimistic about HN.  When a technology is this
young, the existing solutions are usually terrible; which means it
must be possible to do much better; which means many problems that
seem insoluble aren't. Including, I hope, the problem that has
afflicted so many previous communities: being ruined by growth.<br><br><b>Dilution</b><br><br>Users have worried about that since the site was a few months old.
So far these alarms have been false, but they may not always be.
Dilution is a hard problem. But probably soluble; it doesn't mean
much that open conversations have "always" been destroyed by growth
when "always" equals 20 instances.<br><br>But it's important to remember we're trying to solve a new problem,
because that means we're going to have to try new things, most of
which probably won't work.  A couple weeks ago I tried displaying
the names of users with the highest average comment scores in orange.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
That was a mistake.  Suddenly a culture that had been more
or less united was divided into haves and have-nots.  I didn't
realize how united the culture had been till I saw it divided.  It
was painful to watch.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>So orange usernames won't be back.  (Sorry about that.)  But there
will be other equally broken-seeming ideas in the future, and the
ones that turn out to work will probably seem just as broken as
those that don't.<br><br>Probably the most important thing I've learned about dilution is
that it's measured more in behavior than users. It's bad behavior
you want to keep out more than bad people. User behavior turns out
to be surprisingly malleable.  If people are 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html">expected</a> to behave
well, they tend to; and vice versa.<br><br>Though of course forbidding bad behavior does tend to keep away bad
people, because they feel uncomfortably constrained in a place where
they have to behave well.  But this way of keeping them out is
gentler and probably also more effective than overt barriers.<br><br>It's pretty clear now that the broken windows theory applies to
community sites as well.  The theory is that minor forms of bad
behavior encourage worse ones: that a neighborhood with lots of
graffiti and broken windows becomes one where robberies occur.  I
was living in New York when Giuliani introduced the reforms that
made the broken windows theory famous, and the transformation was
miraculous. And I was a Reddit user when the opposite happened
there, and the transformation was equally dramatic.<br><br>I'm not criticizing Steve and Alexis.  What happened to Reddit
didn't happen out of neglect.  From the start they had a policy of
censoring nothing except spam.  Plus Reddit had different goals
from Hacker News.  Reddit was a startup, not a side project; its
goal was to grow as fast as possible.  Combine rapid growth and
zero censorship, and the result is a free for all.  But I don't
think they'd do much differently if they were doing it again.
Measured by traffic, Reddit is much more successful than Hacker
News.<br><br>But what happened to Reddit won't inevitably happen to HN. There
are several local maxima.  There can be places that are free for
alls and places that are more thoughtful, just as there are in the
real world; and people will behave differently depending on which
they're in, just as they do in the real world.<br><br>I've observed this in the wild.  I've seen people cross-posting on
Reddit and Hacker News who actually took the trouble to write two
versions, a flame for Reddit and a more subdued version for HN.<br><br><b>Submissions</b><br><br>There are two major types of problems a site like Hacker News needs
to avoid: bad stories and bad comments.  So far the danger of bad
stories seems smaller.  The stories on the frontpage now are still
roughly the ones that would have been there when HN started.<br><br>I once thought I'd have to weight votes to keep crap off the
frontpage, but I haven't had to yet.  I wouldn't have predicted the
frontpage would hold up so well, and I'm not sure why it has.
Perhaps only the more thoughtful users care enough to submit and
upvote links, so the marginal cost of one random new user approaches
zero.  Or perhaps the frontpage protects itself, by advertising what type of submission is expected.<br><br>The most dangerous thing for the frontpage is stuff that's too easy
to upvote.  If someone proves a new theorem, it takes some work by
the reader to decide whether or not to upvote it.  An amusing cartoon
takes less.  A rant with a rallying cry as the title takes zero,
because people vote it up without even reading it.<br><br>Hence what I call the Fluff Principle: on a user-voted news site,
the links that are easiest to judge will take over unless you take
specific measures to prevent it.<br><br>Hacker News has two kinds of protections against fluff.  The most
common types of fluff links are banned as off-topic.  Pictures of
kittens, political diatribes, and so on are explicitly banned.  This
keeps out most fluff, but not all of it.  Some links are both fluff,
in the sense of being very short, and also on topic.<br><br>There's no single solution to that.  If a link is just an empty
rant, editors will sometimes kill it even if it's on topic in the
sense of being about hacking, because it's not on topic by the real
standard, which is to engage one's intellectual curiosity.  If the
posts on a site are characteristically of this type I sometimes ban
it, which means new stuff at that url is auto-killed.  If a post
has a linkbait title, editors sometimes rephrase it to be more
matter-of-fact.  This is especially necessary with links whose
titles are rallying cries, because otherwise they become implicit
"vote up if you believe such-and-such" posts, which are the most
extreme form of fluff.<br><br>The techniques for dealing with links have to evolve, because the
links do. The existence of aggregators has already affected what
they aggregate. Writers now deliberately write things to draw traffic
from aggregators—sometimes even specific ones.  (No, the irony
of this statement is not lost on me.)  Then there are the more
sinister mutations, like linkjacking—posting a paraphrase of
someone else's article and submitting that instead of the original.
These can get a lot of upvotes, because a lot of what's good in an
article often survives; indeed, the closer the paraphrase is to
plagiarism, the more survives.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>I think it's important that a site that kills submissions provide
a way for users to see what got killed if they want to.  That keeps
editors honest, and just as importantly, makes users confident
they'd know if the editors stopped being honest. HN users can do
this by flipping a switch called showdead in their profile.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Comments</b><br><br>Bad comments seem to be a harder problem than bad submissions.
While the quality of links on the frontpage of HN hasn't changed
much, the quality of the median comment may have decreased somewhat.<br><br>There are two main kinds of badness in comments: meanness and
stupidity.  There is a lot of overlap between the two—mean
comments are disproportionately likely also to be dumb—but
the strategies for dealing with them are different.  Meanness is
easier to control.  You can have rules saying one shouldn't be mean,
and if you enforce them it seems possible to keep a lid on meanness.<br><br>Keeping a lid on stupidity is harder, perhaps because stupidity is
not so easily distinguishable.  Mean people are more likely to know
they're being mean than stupid people are to know they're being
stupid.<br><br>The most dangerous form of stupid comment is not the long but
mistaken argument, but the dumb joke.  Long but mistaken arguments
are actually quite rare.  There is a strong correlation between
comment quality and length; if you wanted to compare the quality
of comments on community sites, average length would be a good
predictor.  Probably the cause is human nature rather than anything
specific to comment threads. Probably it's simply that stupidity
more often takes the form of having few ideas than wrong ones.<br><br>Whatever the cause, stupid comments tend to be short.  And since
it's hard to write a short comment that's distinguished for the
amount of information it conveys, people try to distinguish them
instead by being funny.  The most tempting format for stupid comments
is the supposedly witty put-down, probably because put-downs are
the easiest form of humor. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
So one advantage of forbidding
meanness is that it also cuts down on these.<br><br>Bad comments are like kudzu: they take over rapidly. Comments have
much more effect on new comments than submissions have on new
submissions.  If someone submits a lame article, the other submissions
don't all become lame.  But if someone posts a stupid comment on a
thread, that sets the tone for the region around it.  People reply
to dumb jokes with dumb jokes.<br><br>Maybe the solution is to add a delay before people can respond to
a comment, and make the length of the delay inversely proportional
to some prediction of its quality.  Then dumb threads would grow
slower.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>People</b><br><br>I notice most of the techniques I've described are conservative:
they're aimed at preserving the character of the site rather than
enhancing it.  I don't think that's a bias of mine.  It's due to
the shape of the problem.  Hacker News had the good fortune to start
out good, so in this case it's literally a matter of preservation.
But I think this principle would also apply to sites with different
origins.<br><br>The good things in a community site come from people more than
technology; it's mainly in the prevention of bad things that
technology comes into play. Technology certainly can enhance
discussion.  Nested comments do, for example.  But I'd rather use
a site with primitive features and smart, nice users than a more
advanced one whose users were idiots or <a href="trolls.html">trolls</a>.<br><br>So the most important thing a community site can do is attract the
kind of people it wants.  A site trying to be as big as possible
wants to attract everyone.  But a site aiming at a particular subset
of users has to attract just those—and just as importantly,
repel everyone else.  I've made a conscious effort to do this on
HN.  The graphic design is as plain as possible, and the site rules
discourage dramatic link titles.  The goal is that the only thing
to interest someone arriving at HN for the first time should be the
ideas expressed there.<br><br>The downside of tuning a site to attract certain people is that,
to those people, it can be too attractive.  I'm all too aware how
addictive Hacker News can be.  For me, as for many users, it's a
kind of virtual town square.  When I want to take a break from
working, I walk into the square, just as I might into Harvard Square
or University Ave in the physical world.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
But an online square is
more dangerous than a physical one.  If I spent half the day loitering
on University Ave, I'd notice.  I have to walk a mile to get there,
and sitting in a cafe feels different from working. But visiting
an online forum takes just a click, and feels superficially very
much like working.  You may be wasting your time, but you're not
idle.  Someone is <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">wrong</a> on the Internet, and you're fixing the
problem.<br><br>Hacker News is definitely useful.  I've learned a lot from things
I've read on HN.  I've written several essays that began as comments
there.  So I wouldn't want the site to go away.  But I would like
to be sure it's not a net drag on productivity.  What a disaster
that would be, to attract thousands of smart people to a site that
caused them to waste lots of time.  I wish I could be 100% sure
that's not a description of HN.<br><br>I feel like the addictiveness of games and social applications is
still a mostly unsolved problem.  The situation now is like it was
with crack in the 1980s: we've invented terribly addictive new
things, and we haven't yet evolved ways to protect ourselves from
them.  We will eventually, and that's one of the problems I hope
to focus on next.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I tried ranking users by both average and median comment
score, and average (with the high score thrown out) seemed the more
accurate predictor of high quality.  Median may be the more accurate
predictor of low quality though.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Another thing I learned from this experiment is that if you're
going to distinguish between people, you better be sure you do it
right.  This is one problem where rapid prototyping doesn't work.<br><br>Indeed, that's the intellectually honest argument for not discriminating
between various types of people.  The reason not to do it is not
that everyone's the same, but that it's bad to do wrong and hard
to do right.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
When I catch egregiously linkjacked posts I replace the url
with that of whatever they copied.  Sites that habitually linkjack
get banned.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Digg is notorious for its lack of transparency.  The root of
the problem is not that the guys running Digg are especially sneaky,
but that they use the wrong algorithm for generating their frontpage.
Instead of bubbling up from the bottom as they get more votes, as
on Reddit, stories start at the top and get pushed down by new
arrivals.<br><br>The reason for the difference is that Digg is derived from Slashdot,
while Reddit is derived from Delicious/popular.  Digg is Slashdot
with voting instead of editors, and Reddit is Delicious/popular
with voting instead of bookmarking.  (You can still see fossils of
their origins in their graphic design.)<br><br>Digg's algorithm is very vulnerable to gaming, because any story
that makes it onto the frontpage is the new top story.  Which in
turn forces Digg to respond with extreme countermeasures.  A lot
of startups have some kind of secret about the subterfuges they had
to resort to in the early days, and I suspect Digg's is the extent
to which the top stories were de facto chosen by human editors.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
The dialog on Beavis and Butthead was composed largely of
these, and when I read comments on really bad sites I can hear them
in their voices.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
I suspect most of the techniques for discouraging stupid
comments have yet to be discovered.  Xkcd implemented a particularly
clever one in its IRC channel: don't allow the same thing twice.
Once someone has said "fail," no one can ever say it again.  This
would penalize short comments especially, because they have less
room to avoid collisions in.<br><br>Another promising idea is the <a href="http://stupidfilter.org">stupid 
filter</a>, which is just like a
probabilistic spam filter, but trained on corpora of stupid and
non-stupid comments instead.<br><br>You may not have to kill bad comments to solve the problem.  Comments
at the bottom of a long thread are rarely seen, so it may be enough
to incorporate a prediction of quality in the comment sorting
algorithm.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
What makes most suburbs so demoralizing is that there's no
center to walk to.<br><br>

Maybe.</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">February 2009<br><br>A lot of cities look at Silicon Valley and ask "How could we make
something like that happen here?"  The 
<a href="siliconvalley.html">organic</a> way to do it is to
establish a first-rate university in a place where rich people want
to live. That's how Silicon Valley happened.  But could you shortcut
the process by funding startups?<br><br>Possibly. Let's consider what it would take.<br><br>The first thing to understand is that encouraging startups is a
different problem from encouraging startups in a particular city.
The latter is much more expensive.<br><br>People sometimes think they could improve the startup scene in their
town by starting something like <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y 
Combinator</a> there, but in fact it
will have near zero effect.  I know because Y Combinator itself had
near zero effect on Boston when we were based there half the year.
The people we funded came from all over the country (indeed, the
world) and afterward they went wherever they could get more
funding—which generally meant Silicon Valley.<br><br>The seed funding business is not a regional business, because at
that stage startups are mobile. They're just a couple founders with
laptops. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you want to encourage startups in a particular city, you have
to fund startups that won't leave.  There are two ways to do that:
have rules preventing them from leaving, or fund them at the point
in their life when they naturally take root.  The first approach
is a mistake, because it becomes a filter for selecting bad startups.
If your terms force startups to do things they don't want to, only
the desperate ones will take your money.<br><br>Good startups will move to another city as a condition of funding.
What they won't do is agree not to move the next time they need
funding.  So the only way to get them to stay is to give them enough
that they never need to leave.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>How much would that take?  If you want to keep startups from leaving
your town, you have to give them enough that they're not tempted
by an offer from Silicon Valley VCs that requires them to move.  A
startup would be able to refuse such an offer if they had grown to
the point where they were (a) rooted in your town and/or (b) so
successful that VCs would fund them even if they didn't move.<br><br>How much would it cost to grow a startup to that point? A minimum
of several hundred thousand dollars.  <a href="http://wufoo.com">Wufoo</a>

themselves in Tampa on $118k, but they're an extreme case.  On
average it would take at least half a million.<br><br>So if it seems too good to be true to think you could grow a local
silicon valley by giving startups $15-20k each like Y Combinator,
that's because it is.  To make them stick around you'd have to give
them at least 20 times that much.<br><br>However, even that is an interesting prospect.  Suppose to be on
the safe side it would cost a million dollars per startup. If you
could get startups to stick to your town for a million apiece, then
for a billion dollars you could bring in a thousand startups. That probably wouldn't push you past Silicon Valley itself, 
but it might get you second place.<br><br>For the price of a football stadium, any town that was decent to
live in could make itself one of the biggest startup hubs in the
world.<br><br>What's more, it wouldn't take very long.   You could probably do
it in five years.  During the term of one mayor. And it would get
easier over time, because the more startups you had in town, the
less it would take to get new ones to move there. By the time you
had a thousand startups in town, the VCs wouldn't be trying so hard
to get them to move to Silicon Valley; instead they'd be opening
local offices.  Then you'd really be in good shape.  You'd have
started a self-sustaining chain reaction like the one that drives
the Valley.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>But now comes the hard part.  You have to pick the startups.  How
do you do that?  Picking startups is a rare and valuable skill, and
the handful of people who have it are not readily hireable.  And
this skill is so hard to measure that if a government did try to
hire people with it, they'd almost certainly get the wrong ones.<br><br>For example, a city could give money to a VC fund to establish a
local branch, and let them make the choices.  But only a bad VC
fund would take that deal.  They wouldn't <i>seem</i> bad to the city
officials.  They'd seem very impressive.  But they'd be bad at
picking startups.  That's the characteristic failure mode of VCs.
All VCs look impressive to limited partners.  The difference between
the good ones and the bad ones only becomes visible in the other
half of their jobs: choosing and advising startups.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>What you really want is a pool of local angel investors—people
investing money they made from their own startups.  But unfortunately
you run into a chicken and egg problem here.  If your city isn't
already a startup hub, there won't be people there who got rich
from startups. And there is no way I can think of that a city could
attract angels from outside. By definition they're rich.  There's
no incentive that would make them move.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>However, a city could select startups by piggybacking on the expertise
of investors who weren't local.  It would be pretty straightforward
to make a list of the most eminent Silicon Valley angels and from
that to generate a list of all the startups they'd invested in.  If
a city offered these companies a million dollars each to move, a
lot of the earlier stage ones would probably take it.<br><br>Preposterous as this plan sounds, it's probably the most efficient
way a city could select good startups.<br><br>It would hurt the startups somewhat to be separated from their
original investors. On the other hand, the extra million dollars
would give them a lot more runway.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>Would the transplanted startups survive?  Quite possibly. The only
way to find out would be to try it.  It would be a pretty cheap
experiment, as civil expenditures go.  Pick 30 startups that eminent
angels have recently invested in, give them each a million dollars
if they'll relocate to your city, and see what happens after a year.
If they seem to be thriving, you can try importing startups on a
larger scale.<br><br>Don't be too legalistic about the conditions under which they're
allowed to leave.  Just have a gentlemen's agreement.<br><br>Don't try to do it on the cheap and pick only 10 for the initial
experiment.  If you do this on too small a scale you'll just guarantee
failure. Startups need to be around other startups.  30 would be
enough to feel like a community.<br><br>Don't try to make them all work in some renovated warehouse you've
made into an "incubator."  Real startups prefer to work in their
own spaces.<br><br>In fact, don't impose any restrictions on the startups at all.
Startup founders are mostly <a href="gba.html">hackers</a>, 
and hackers are much more
constrained by gentlemen's agreements than regulations.  If they
shake your hand on a promise, they'll keep it.  But show them a
lock and their first thought is how to pick it.<br><br>Interestingly, the 30-startup experiment could be done by any
sufficiently rich private citizen.  And what pressure it would 
put on the city if it worked.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><center>___</center><br><br>Should the city take stock in return for the money?
In principle they're entitled to, but how would they choose valuations
for the startups?  You couldn't just give them all the same valuation:
that would be too low for some (who'd turn you down) and too high
for others (because it might make their next round a "down round").
And since we're assuming we're doing this without being able to
pick startups, we also have to assume we can't value them, since
that's practically the same thing.<br><br>Another reason not to take stock in the startups is that startups
are often involved in disreputable things.  So are established
companies, but they don't get blamed for it.  If someone gets
murdered by someone they met on Facebook, the press will treat the
story as if it were about Facebook.  If someone gets murdered by
someone they met at a supermarket, the press will just treat it as
a story about a murder.  So understand that if you invest in startups,
they might build things that get used for pornography, or file-sharing,
or the expression of unfashionable opinions.  You should probably
sponsor this project jointly with your political opponents, so they
can't use whatever the startups do as a club to beat you with.<br><br>It would be too much of a political liability just to give
the startups the money, though.  So the best plan would be to 
make it convertible debt, but which didn't convert except in
a really big round, like $20 million.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>How well this scheme worked would depend on the 
<a href="cities.html">city</a>.  There are
some towns, like Portland, that would be easy to turn into startup
hubs, and others, like Detroit, where it would really be an uphill
battle.  So be honest with yourself about the sort of town you have
before you try this.<br><br>It will be easier in proportion to how much your town resembles San
Francisco.  Do you have good weather?  Do people live downtown, or
have they abandoned the center for the suburbs?  Would the city be
described as "hip" and "tolerant," or as reflecting "traditional
values?"  Are there good universities nearby?  Are there walkable
neighborhoods?  Would nerds feel at home?  If you answered yes to
all these questions, you might be able not only to pull off this
scheme, but to do it for less than a million per startup.<br><br>I realize the chance of any city having
the political will to carry out this plan is microscopically
small.  I just wanted to explore what it would take if one did.
How hard would it be to jumpstart a silicon valley?  It's
fascinating to think this prize might be within
the reach of so many cities.  So even though they'll all still
spend the money on the stadium, at least now someone can ask them:
why did you choose to do that instead of becoming a serious
rival to Silicon Valley?<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
What people who start these supposedly local seed firms always
find is that (a) their applicants come from all over, not just the
local area, and (b) the local startups also apply to the other seed
firms.  So what ends up happening is that the applicant pool gets
partitioned by quality rather than geography.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Interestingly, the bad VCs fail by choosing startups run by
people like them—people who are good presenters, but have no
real substance.   It's a case of the fake leading the fake.  And
since everyone involved is so plausible, the LPs who invest in these
funds have no idea what's happening till they measure their returns.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Not even being a tax haven, I suspect.  That makes some rich
people move, but not the type who would make good angel investors
in startups.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]

collision course and started to speculate about what they'd produce
when they converged.  We now know the answer: computers.  It's clear
now that even by using the word "convergence" we were giving TV too
much credit.  This won't be convergence so much as replacement.
People may still watch things they call "TV shows," but they'll
watch them mostly on computers.<br><br>What decided the contest for computers?  Four forces, three of which
one could have predicted, and one that would have been harder to.<br><br>One predictable cause of victory is that the Internet is an open
platform.  Anyone can build whatever they want on it, and the market
picks the winners.  So innovation happens at hacker speeds instead
of big company speeds.<br><br>The second is Moore's Law, which has worked its usual magic on
Internet bandwidth. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The third reason computers won is piracy. Users prefer it 
not just because it's free, but because it's
more convenient.  Bittorrent and YouTube have already trained a new
generation of viewers that the place to watch shows is on a computer
screen.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The somewhat more surprising force was one specific type of innovation:
social applications.  The average teenage kid has a pretty much
infinite capacity for talking to their friends.  But they can't
physically be with them all the time.  When I was in high school
the solution was the telephone.  Now it's social networks, multiplayer
games, and various messaging applications.  The way you reach them
all is through a computer.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Which means every teenage kid (a)
wants a computer with an Internet connection, (b) has an incentive
to figure out how to use it, and (c) spends countless hours in front
of it.<br><br>This was the most powerful force of all.  This was what made everyone
want computers.  Nerds got computers because they liked them.  Then
gamers got them to play games on.  But it was connecting to other
people that got everyone else: that's what made even grandmas and
14 year old girls want computers.
<!--
Computers still aren't really ready for prime time.  I'm pretty
comfortable with technology, but I would be horrified at the prospect
of having to deal with the virus-ridden Windows machine the average
person uses.  I can't believe they put up with it.  But they will
to reach their friends.--><br><br>After decades of running an IV drip right into their audience,
people in the entertainment business had understandably come to
think of them as rather passive.  They thought they'd be able to
dictate the way shows reached audiences.  But they underestimated
the force of their desire to connect with one another.<br><br>Facebook killed TV.  That is wildly oversimplified, of course, but
probably as close to the truth as you can get in three words.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>The TV networks already seem, grudgingly, to see where things are
going, and have responded by putting their stuff, grudgingly, online.
But they're still dragging their heels.  They still seem to wish
people would watch shows on TV instead, just as newspapers that put
their stories online still seem to wish people would wait till the
next morning and read them printed on paper.  They should both just
face the fact that the Internet is the primary medium.<br><br>They'd be in a better position if they'd done that earlier.  When
a new medium arises that's powerful enough to make incumbents
nervous, then it's probably powerful enough to win, and the best
thing they can do is jump in immediately.<br><br>Whether they like it or not, big changes are coming, because the
Internet dissolves the two cornerstones of broadcast media:
synchronicity and locality.  On the Internet, you don't have to
send everyone the same signal, and you don't have to send it to
them from a local source.  People will watch what they want when
they want it, and group themselves according to whatever shared
interest they feel most strongly.  Maybe their strongest shared
interest will be their physical location, but I'm guessing not.
Which means local TV is probably dead.  It was an artifact of
limitations imposed by old technology.  If someone were creating
an Internet-based TV company from scratch now, they might have some
plan for shows aimed at specific regions, but it wouldn't be a top
priority.<br><br>Synchronicity and locality are tied together.  TV network affiliates
care what's on at 10 because that delivers viewers for local news
at 11.  This connection adds more brittleness than strength, however:
people don't watch what's on at 10 because they want to watch the
news afterward.<br><br>TV networks will fight these trends, because they don't have
sufficient flexibility to adapt to them.  They're hemmed in by local
affiliates in much the same way car companies are hemmed in by
dealers and unions.  Inevitably, the people running the networks
will take the easy route and try to keep the old model running for
a couple more years, just as the record labels have done.<br><br>A recent article in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> described how TV networks
were trying to add more live shows, partly as a way to make viewers
watch TV synchronously instead of watching recorded shows when it
suited them.  Instead of delivering what viewers want, they're
trying to force them to change their habits to suit the networks'
obsolete business model.  That never works unless you have a monopoly
or cartel to enforce it, and even then it only works temporarily.<br><br>The other reason networks like live shows is that they're cheaper
to produce.  There they have the right idea, but they haven't
followed it to its conclusion.   Live content can be way cheaper
than networks realize, and the way to take advantage of dramatic
decreases in cost is to 
<a href="http://justin.tv">increase volume</a>.  The networks are prevented
from seeing this whole line of reasoning because they still think
of themselves as being in the broadcast business—as sending one
signal to everyone.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><center>___</center><br><br><a href="badeconomy.html">Now</a> would be a good time to start any company that competes with
TV networks.  That's what a lot of Internet startups are, though
they may not have had this as an explicit goal.  People only have
so many leisure hours a day, and TV is premised on such long sessions
(unlike Google, which prides itself on sending users on their way
quickly) that anything that takes up their time is competing with
it.  But in addition to such indirect competitors, I think TV
companies will increasingly face direct ones.<br><br>Even in cable TV, the long tail was lopped off prematurely by the
threshold you had to get over to start a new channel.  It will be
longer on the Internet, and there will be more mobility within it.
In this new world, the existing players will only have the advantages
any big company has in its market.<br><br>That will change the balance of power between the networks and the
people who produce shows.  The networks used to be gatekeepers.
They distributed your work, and sold advertising on it.  Now the
people who produce a show can distribute it themselves.  The main
value networks supply now is ad sales.  Which will tend to put them
in the position of service providers rather than publishers.<br><br>Shows will change even more.  On the Internet there's no reason to
keep their current format, or even the fact that they have a single
format.  Indeed, the more interesting sort of convergence that's
coming is between shows and games.  But on the question of what
sort of entertainment gets distributed on the Internet in 20 years,
I wouldn't dare to make any predictions, except that things will
change a lot.  We'll get whatever the most imaginative people can
cook up.  That's why the Internet won.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Thanks to Trevor Blackwell for this point.  He adds: "I
remember the eyes of phone companies gleaming in the early 90s when
they talked about convergence.  They thought most programming would
be on demand, and they would implement it and make a lot of money.
It didn't work out. They assumed that their local network infrastructure
would be critical to do video on-demand, because you couldn't
possibly stream it from a few data centers over the internet. At
the time (1992) the entire cross-country Internet bandwidth wasn't
enough for one video stream. But wide-area bandwidth increased more
than they expected and they were beaten by iTunes and Hulu."<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Copyright owners tend to focus on the aspect they see of
piracy, which is the lost revenue.  They therefore think what drives
users to do it is the desire to get something for free.  But iTunes
shows that people will pay for stuff online, if you make it easy.
A significant component of piracy is simply that it offers a better
user experience.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Or a phone that is actually a computer.  I'm not making any
predictions about the size of the device that will replace TV, just
that it will have a browser and get data via the Internet.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Emmett Shear writes: "I'd argue the long tail for sports may
be even larger than the long tail for other kinds of content. Anyone
can broadcast a high school football game that will be interesting
to 10,000 people or so, even if the quality of production is not
so good."<br><br>

investing.  Seven years later I still hadn't started.  I put it off
because it seemed mysterious and complicated.   It turns out to be 
easier than I expected, and also more interesting.<br><br>The part I thought was hard, the mechanics of investing, really
isn't. You give a startup money and they give you stock.  You'll
probably get either preferred stock, which means stock with extra
rights like getting your money back first in a sale, or convertible
debt, which means (on paper) you're lending the company money, and
the debt converts to stock at the next sufficiently big funding
round. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>There are sometimes minor tactical advantages to using one or the
other.  The paperwork for convertible debt is simpler.  But really
it doesn't matter much which you use.  Don't spend much time worrying
about the details of deal terms, especially when you first start
angel investing.  That's not how you win at this game.  When you
hear people talking about a successful angel investor, they're not
saying "He got a 4x liquidation preference." They're saying "He
invested in Google."<br><br>That's how you win: by investing in the right startups.  That is
so much more important than anything else that I worry I'm misleading
you by even talking about other things.<br><br><b>Mechanics</b><br><br>Angel investors often syndicate deals, which means they join together
to invest on the same terms.  In a syndicate there is usually a
"lead" investor who negotiates the terms with the startup.  But not
always: sometimes the startup cobbles together a syndicate of
investors who approach them independently, and the startup's lawyer
supplies the paperwork.<br><br>The easiest way to get started in angel investing is to find a
friend who already does it, and try to get included in his syndicates.
Then all you have to do is write checks.<br><br>Don't feel like you have to join a syndicate, though.  It's not that
hard to do it yourself.  You can just use the standard 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html">series AA</a>
documents Wilson Sonsini and Y Combinator published online.
You should of course have your lawyer review everything.  Both you
and the startup should have lawyers.  But the lawyers don't have
to create the agreement from scratch.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>
When you negotiate terms with a startup, there are two numbers you
care about: how much money you're putting in, and the valuation of
the company.  The valuation determines how much stock you get.  If
you put $50,000 into a company at a pre-money valuation of $1
million, then the post-money valuation is $1.05 million, and you
get .05/1.05, or 4.76% of the company's stock.<br><br>If the company raises more money later, the new investor will take
a chunk of the company away from all the existing shareholders just
as you did.  If in the next round they sell 10% of the company to
a new investor, your 4.76% will be reduced to 4.28%.<br><br>That's ok.  Dilution is normal.  What saves you from being mistreated
in future rounds, usually, is that you're in the same boat as the
founders.  They can't dilute you without diluting themselves just
as much.  And they won't dilute themselves unless they end up 
<a href="equity.html">net ahead</a>.  So in theory, each further 
round of investment leaves you
with a smaller share of an even more valuable company, till after
several more rounds you end up with .5% of the company at the point
where it IPOs, and you are very happy because your $50,000 has
become $5 million. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The agreement by which you invest should have provisions that 
let you contribute to
future rounds to maintain your percentage.  So it's your choice
whether you get diluted.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
If the company does really well,
you eventually will, because eventually the valuations will get so
high it's not worth it for you.<br><br>How much does an angel invest?  That varies enormously, from $10,000
to hundreds of thousands or in rare cases even millions.  The upper
bound is obviously the total amount the founders want to raise.
The lower bound is 5-10% of the total or $10,000, whichever
is greater.  A typical angel round these days might be $150,000
raised from 5 people.<br><br>Valuations don't vary as much.  For angel rounds it's rare to see
a valuation lower than half a million or higher than 4 or 5 million.
4 million is starting to be VC territory.<br><br>How do you decide what valuation to offer?  If you're part of a
round led by someone else, that problem is solved for you.  But
what if you're investing by yourself?  There's no real answer.
There is no rational way to value an early stage startup.  The
valuation reflects nothing more than the strength of the company's
bargaining position.  If they really want you, either because they
desperately need money, or you're someone who can help them a lot,
they'll let you invest at a low valuation.  If they don't need you,
it will be higher.  So guess.  The startup may not have any more
idea what the number should be than you do. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Ultimately it doesn't matter much.  When angels make a lot of money
from a deal, it's not because they invested at a valuation of $1.5
million instead of $3 million.  It's because the company was really
successful.<br><br>I can't emphasize that too much.  Don't get hung up on mechanics
or deal terms.  What you should spend your time thinking about is
whether the company is good.<br><br>(Similarly, founders also should not get hung up on deal
terms, but should spend their time thinking about how to make the
company good.)<br><br>There's a second less obvious component of an angel investment: how
much you're expected to help the startup.  Like the amount you
invest, this can vary a lot.  You don't have to do anything if you
don't want to; you could simply be a source of money.  Or you can
become a de facto employee of the company.  Just make sure that you
and the startup agree in advance about roughly how much you'll do
for them.<br><br>Really hot companies sometimes have high standards for angels.  The
ones everyone wants to invest in practically audition investors,
and only take money from people who are famous and/or will work
hard for them.  But don't feel like you have to put in a lot of
time or you won't get to invest in any good startups.  There is a
surprising lack of correlation between how hot a deal a startup is
and how well it ends up doing.  Lots of hot startups will end up
failing, and lots of startups no one likes will end up succeeding.
And the latter are so desperate for money that they'll take it from
anyone at a low valuation. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Picking Winners</b><br><br>It would be nice to be able to pick those out, wouldn't it?  The
part of angel investing that has most effect on your returns, picking
the right companies, is also the hardest.  So you should practically
ignore (or more precisely, archive, in the Gmail sense) everything
I've told you so far.  You may need to refer to it at some point,
but it is not the central issue.<br><br>The central issue is picking the right startups.  What "Make something
people want" is for startups, "Pick the right startups" is for
investors.  Combined they yield "Pick the startups that will make
something people want."<br><br>How do you do that?  It's not as simple as picking startups that
are already making something wildly popular.  By then it's
too late for angels.  VCs will already be onto them.  As an angel,
you have to pick startups before they've got a hit—either
because they've made something great but users don't realize it
yet, like Google early on, or because they're still an iteration
or two away from the big hit, like Paypal when they were making
software for transferring money between PDAs.<br><br>To be a good angel investor, you have to be a good judge of potential.
That's what it comes down to.  VCs can be fast followers.  Most of
them don't try to predict what will win.  They just try to notice
quickly when something already is winning.  But angels have to be
able to predict.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>One interesting consequence of this fact is that there are a lot
of people out there who have never even made an angel investment
and yet are already better angel investors than they realize.
Someone who doesn't know the first thing about the mechanics of
venture funding but knows what a successful startup founder looks
like is actually far ahead of someone who knows termsheets inside
out, but thinks 
<a href="gba.html">"hacker"</a> means someone who breaks into computers.
If you can recognize good startup founders by empathizing with
them—if you both resonate at the same frequency—then
you may already be a better startup picker than the median professional
VC.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>Paul Buchheit, for example, started angel investing about a year
after me, and he was pretty much immediately as good as me at picking
startups.  My extra year of experience was rounding error compared
to our ability to empathize with founders.<br><br>What makes a good founder?  If there were a word that meant the
opposite of hapless, that would be the one.  Bad founders seem
hapless.  They may be smart, or not, but somehow events overwhelm
them and they get discouraged and give up.  Good founders make
things happen the way they want.  Which is not to say they force
things to happen in a predefined way.  Good founders have a healthy
respect for reality.  But they are relentlessly resourceful.  That's
the closest I can get to the opposite of hapless.  You want to fund
people who are relentlessly resourceful.<br><br>Notice we started out talking about things, and now we're talking
about people.  There is an ongoing debate between investors which
is more important, the people, or the idea—or more precisely,
the market. Some, like Ron Conway, say it's the people—that
the idea will change, but the people are the foundation of the
company.  Whereas Marc Andreessen says he'd back ok founders in a
hot market over great founders in a bad one.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>These two positions are not so far apart as they seem, because good
people find good markets.  Bill Gates would probably have ended up
pretty rich even if IBM hadn't happened to drop the PC standard in
his lap.<br><br>I've thought a lot about the disagreement between the investors who
prefer to bet on people and those who prefer to bet on markets.
It's kind of surprising that it even exists.  You'd expect opinions
to have converged more.<br><br>But I think I've figured out what's going on.  The three most
prominent people I know who favor markets are Marc, Jawed Karim,
and Joe Kraus.  And all three of them, in their own startups,
basically flew into a thermal: they hit a market growing so fast
that it was all they could do to keep up with it.  That kind of
experience is hard to ignore.  Plus I think they underestimate
themselves: they think back to how easy it felt to ride that huge
thermal upward, and they think "anyone could have done it."  But
that isn't true; they are not ordinary people.<br><br>So as an angel investor I think you want to go with Ron Conway and
bet on people.  Thermals happen, yes, but no one can predict
them—not even the founders, and certainly not you as an
investor.  And only good people can ride the thermals if they hit
them anyway.<br><br><b>Deal Flow</b><br><br>Of course the question of how to choose startups presumes you
have startups to choose between.  How do you find them?  This is
yet another problem that gets solved for you by syndicates.  If you
tag along on a friend's investments, you don't have to find startups.<br><br>The problem is not finding startups, exactly, but finding a stream
of reasonably high quality ones.  The traditional way to do this
is through contacts.  If you're friends with a lot of investors and
founders, they'll send deals your way.  The Valley basically runs
on referrals.  And once you start to become known as reliable,
useful investor, people will refer lots of deals to you.  I certainly
will.<br><br>There's also a newer way to find startups, which is to come to
events like Y Combinator's Demo Day, where a batch of newly created
startups presents to investors all at once.   We have two Demo Days
a year, one in March and one in August.  These are basically mass
referrals.<br><br>But events like Demo Day only account for a fraction of matches
between startups and investors.  The personal referral is still the
most common route.  So if you want to hear about new startups, the
best way to do it is to get lots of referrals.<br><br>The best way to get lots of referrals is to invest in startups.  No
matter how smart and nice you seem, insiders will be reluctant to
send you referrals until you've proven yourself by doing a couple
investments.  Some smart, nice guys turn out to be flaky,
high-maintenance investors. But once you prove yourself as a good
investor, the deal flow, as they call it, will increase rapidly in
both quality and quantity.  At the extreme, for someone like Ron
Conway, it is basically identical with the deal flow of the whole
Valley.<br><br>So if you want to invest seriously, the way to get started is to
bootstrap yourself off your existing connections, be a good investor
in the startups you meet that way, and eventually you'll start a
chain reaction.  Good investors are rare, even in Silicon Valley.
There probably aren't more than a couple hundred serious angels in the whole
Valley, and yet they're probably the single most important ingredient
in making the Valley what it is.  Angels are the limiting reagent
in startup formation.<br><br>If there are only a couple hundred serious angels in the Valley, 
then by deciding to become one you could single-handedly make the pipeline
for startups in Silicon Valley significantly wider.  That is kind
of mind-blowing.<br><br><b>Being Good</b><br><br>How do you be a good angel investor?  The first thing you need is
to be decisive.  When we talk to founders about good and bad
investors, one of the ways we describe the good ones is to say "he
writes checks." That doesn't mean the investor says yes to everyone.
Far from it.  It means he makes up his mind quickly,
and follows through.  You may be thinking, how hard could that be?
You'll see when you try it.  It follows from the nature of angel
investing that the decisions are hard.  You have to guess early,
at the stage when the most promising ideas still seem counterintuitive,
because if they were obviously good, VCs would already have funded
them.<br><br>Suppose it's 1998.  You come across a startup founded by a couple
grad students.  They say they're going to work on Internet search.
There are already a bunch of big public companies doing search.
How can these grad students possibly compete with them?  And does
search even matter anyway?  All the search engines are trying to
get people to start calling them "portals" instead.  Why would you
want to invest in a startup run by a couple of nobodies who are
trying to compete with large, aggressive companies in an area they
themselves have declared passe?  And yet the grad students seem
pretty smart.  What do you do?<br><br>There's a hack for being decisive when you're inexperienced: ratchet
down the size of your investment till it's an amount you wouldn't
care too much about losing.  For every rich person (you probably
shouldn't try angel investing unless you think of yourself as rich)
there's some amount that would be painless, though annoying, to
lose.  Till you feel comfortable investing, don't invest more than
that per startup.<br><br>For example, if you have $5 million in investable assets, it would
probably be painless (though annoying) to lose $15,000.  That's
less than .3% of your net worth.  So start by making 3 or 4 $15,000
investments.  Nothing will teach you about angel investing like
experience.  Treat the first few as an educational expense.  $60,000
is less than a lot of graduate programs.  Plus you get equity.<br><br>What's really uncool is to be strategically indecisive: to string
founders along while trying to gather more information about the
startup's trajectory. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font>
 There's always a temptation to do that,
because you just have so little to go on, but you have to consciously
resist it.  In the long term it's to your advantage to be good.<br><br>The other component of being a good angel investor is simply to be
a good person.  Angel investing is not a business where you make
money by screwing people over.  Startups create wealth, and
creating wealth is not a zero sum game.  No one has to lose for you
to win.  In fact, if you mistreat the founders you invest in, they'll
just get demoralized and the company will do worse.  Plus your
referrals will dry up.  So I recommend being good.<br><br>The most successful angel investors I know are all basically good
people.  Once they invest in a company, all they want to do is help
it.  And they'll help people they haven't invested in too.  When
they do favors they don't seem to keep track of them.  It's too
much overhead.  They just try to help everyone, and assume good
things will flow back to them somehow. Empirically that seems to
work.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Convertible debt can be either capped at a particular valuation,
or can be done at a discount to whatever the valuation turns out
to be when it converts.  E.g. convertible debt at a discount of 30%
means when it converts you get stock as if you'd invested at a 30%
lower valuation.  That can be useful in cases where you can't or
don't want to figure out what the valuation should be.  You leave
it to the next investor.  On the other hand, a lot of investors
want to know exactly what they're getting, so they will only do
convertible debt with a cap.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
The expensive part of creating an agreement from scratch is
not writing the agreement, but bickering at several hundred
dollars an hour over the details.  That's why the series AA paperwork
aims at a middle ground.  You can just start from the compromise
you'd have reached after lots of back and forth.<br><br>When you fund a startup, both your lawyers should be specialists
in startups.  Do not use ordinary corporate lawyers for this.  Their
inexperience makes them overbuild: they'll create huge, overcomplicated
agreements, and spend hours arguing over irrelevant things.<br><br>In the Valley, the top startup law firms are Wilson Sonsini, Orrick,
Fenwick &amp; West, Gunderson Dettmer, and Cooley Godward.  In Boston
the best are Goodwin Procter, Wilmer Hale, and Foley Hoag.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Your mileage may vary.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
These anti-dilution provisions also protect you against
tricks like a later investor trying to steal the company by doing
another round that values the company at $1.  If you have a competent
startup lawyer handle the deal for you, you should be protected
against such tricks initially.  But it could become a problem later.
If a big VC firm wants to invest in the startup after you, they may
try to make you take out your anti-dilution protections.  And if
they do the startup will be pressuring you to agree.  They'll tell
you that if you don't, you're going to kill their deal with the VC.
I recommend you solve this problem by having a gentlemen's agreement
with the founders: agree with them in advance that you're not going
to give up your anti-dilution protections.  Then it's up to them
to tell VCs early on.<br><br>The reason you don't want to give them up is the following scenario.
The VCs recapitalize the company, meaning they give it additional
funding at a pre-money valuation of zero.  This wipes out the
existing shareholders, including both you and the founders.  They
then grant the founders lots of options, because they need them to
stay around, but you get nothing.<br><br>Obviously this is not a nice thing to do.  It doesn't happen often.
Brand-name VCs wouldn't recapitalize a company just to steal a few
percent from an angel.  But there's a continuum here.  A less
upstanding, lower-tier VC might be tempted to do it to steal a big
chunk of stock.<br><br>I'm not saying you should always absolutely refuse to give up your
anti-dilution protections.  Everything is a negotiation.  If you're
part of a powerful syndicate, you might be able to give up legal
protections and rely on social ones.  If you invest in a deal led
by a big angel like Ron Conway, for example, you're pretty well
protected against being mistreated, because any VC would think twice
before crossing him.  This kind of protection is one of the reasons
angels like to invest in syndicates.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Don't invest so much, or at such a low valuation, that you
end up with an excessively large share of a startup, unless you're
sure your money will be the last they ever need.  Later stage
investors won't invest in a company if the founders don't have
enough equity left to motivate them.  I talked to a VC recently who
said he'd met with a company he really liked, but he turned
them down because investors already owned more than half of it.
Those investors probably thought they'd been pretty clever by getting
such a large chunk of this desirable company, but in fact they were
shooting themselves in the foot.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
At any given time I know of at least 3 or 4 YC alumni who I
believe will be big successes but who are running on vapor,
financially, because investors don't yet get what they're doing.
(And no, unfortunately, I can't tell you who they are.  I can't
refer a startup to an investor I don't know.)<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
There are some VCs who can predict instead of reacting.  Not
surprisingly, these are the most successful ones.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
It's somewhat sneaky of me to put it this way, because the
median VC loses money.  That's one of the most surprising things
I've learned about VC while working on Y Combinator.  Only a fraction
of VCs even have positive returns.  The rest exist to satisfy demand
among fund managers for venture capital as an asset class.  Learning
this explained a lot about some of the VCs I encountered when we
were working on Viaweb.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
VCs also generally say they prefer great markets to great
people.  But what they're really saying is they want both.  They're
so selective that they only even consider great people.  So when
they say they care above all about big markets, they mean that's
how they choose between great people.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
Founders rightly dislike the sort of investor who says he's
interested in investing but doesn't want to lead.  There are
circumstances where this is an acceptable excuse, but more often
than not what it means is "No, but if you turn out to be a hot deal,
I want to be able to claim retroactively I said yes."<br><br>If you like a startup enough to invest in it, then invest in it.
Just use the standard <a href="http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html">series

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
March 2009<br><br>A couple days ago I finally got being a good startup founder down
to two words:  relentlessly resourceful.<br><br>Till then the best I'd managed was to get the opposite quality down
to one: hapless.  Most dictionaries say hapless means unlucky.  But
the dictionaries are not doing a very good job.  A team that outplays
its opponents but loses because of a bad decision by the referee
could be called unlucky, but not hapless.  Hapless implies passivity.
To be hapless is to be battered by circumstances — to let the world
have its way with you, instead of having your way with the world.
<!--Unlucky is a bad synonym, because it emphasizes the role of chance
in bad outcomes.  Hapless overlaps more with the other component
of bad outcomes, the half that makes them deserved. -->
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Unfortunately there's no antonym of hapless, which makes it difficult
to tell founders what to aim for.  "Don't be hapless" is not much
of a rallying cry.<br><br>It's not hard to express the quality we're looking for in metaphors.
The best is probably a running back.  A good running back is not
merely determined, but flexible as well.  They want to get downfield,
but they adapt their plans on the fly.<br><br>Unfortunately this is just a metaphor, and not a useful one to most
people outside the US.   "Be like a running back" is no better than
"Don't be hapless."<br><br>But finally I've figured out how to express this quality directly.
I was writing a talk for 
<a href="angelinvesting.html">investors</a>, and I had to explain what to
look for in founders.  What would someone who was the opposite of
hapless be like?  They'd be relentlessly resourceful.  Not merely
relentless.  That's not enough to make things go your way except
in a few mostly uninteresting domains.  In any interesting domain,
the difficulties will be novel.  Which means you can't simply plow
through them, because you don't know initially how hard they are;
you don't know whether you're about to plow through a block of foam
or granite.  So you have to be resourceful. You have to keep
trying new things.<br><br>Be relentlessly resourceful.<br><br>That sounds right, but is it simply a description
of how to be successful in general?  I don't think so.  This isn't
the recipe for success in writing or painting, for example.  In
that kind of work the recipe is more to be actively curious.
Resourceful implies the obstacles are external, which they generally
are in startups. But in writing and painting they're mostly internal;
the obstacle is your own obtuseness.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>There probably are other fields where "relentlessly resourceful"
is the recipe for success.  But though other fields may share it,
I think this is the best short description we'll find of what makes
a good startup founder.  I doubt it could be made more precise.<br><br>Now that we know what we're looking for, that leads to other
questions.  For example, can this quality be taught?  After four
years of trying to teach it to people, I'd say that yes, surprisingly
often it can.  Not to everyone, but to many people. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Some
people are just constitutionally passive, but others have a latent
ability to be relentlessly resourceful that only needs to be brought
out.<br><br>This is particularly true of young people who have till now always
been under the thumb of some kind of authority.  Being relentlessly
resourceful is definitely not the recipe for success in big companies,
or in most schools.  I don't even want to think what the recipe is
in big companies, but it is certainly longer and messier, involving
some combination of resourcefulness, obedience, and building
alliances.<br><br>Identifying this quality also brings us closer to answering a
question people often wonder about: how many startups there could
be.  There is not, as some people seem to think, any economic upper
bound on this number.  There's no reason to believe there is any
limit on the amount of newly created wealth consumers can absorb,
any more than there is a limit on the number of theorems that can
be proven.  So probably the limiting factor on the number of startups
is the pool of potential founders.  Some people would make good
founders, and others wouldn't.  And now that we can say what makes
a good founder, we know how to put an upper bound on the size of
the pool.<br><br>This test is also useful to individuals.  If you want to know whether
you're the right sort of person to start a startup, ask yourself
whether you're relentlessly resourceful.  And if you want to know
whether to recruit someone as a cofounder, ask if they are.<br><br>You can even use it tactically.  If I were running a startup, this
would be the phrase I'd tape to the mirror.  "Make something people
want" is the destination, but "Be relentlessly resourceful" is how
you get there.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I think the reason the dictionaries are wrong is that the
meaning of the word has shifted.  No one writing a dictionary from
scratch today would say that hapless meant unlucky.  But a couple
hundred years ago they might have.  People were more at the mercy
of circumstances in the past, and as a result a lot of the words
we use for good and bad outcomes have origins in words about luck.<br><br>When I was living in Italy, I was once trying to tell someone
that I hadn't had much success in doing something, but I couldn't
think of the Italian word for success.  I spent some time trying
to describe the word I meant.  Finally she said "Ah! Fortuna!"<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There are aspects of startups where the recipe is to be
actively curious.  There can be times when what you're doing is
almost pure discovery.  Unfortunately these times are a small
proportion of the whole.  On the other hand, they are in research
too.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
I'd almost say to most people, but I realize (a) I have no
idea what most people are like, and (b) I'm pathologically optimistic
about people's ability to change.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts

interesting startup founders of the last 30 years.  How do
you decide who's the most interesting?  The best test seemed
to be influence: who are the 5
who've influenced me most?  Who do I use as examples when I'm
talking to companies we fund?  Who do I find myself quoting?<br><br><b>1. Steve Jobs</b><br><br>I'd guess Steve is the most influential founder not just for me but
for most people you could ask.  A lot of startup culture is Apple
culture.  He was the original young founder.  And while the concept
of "insanely great" already existed in the arts, it was a novel
idea to introduce into a company in the 1980s.<br><br>More remarkable still, he's stayed interesting for 30 years.  People
await new Apple products the way they'd await new books by a popular
novelist.  Steve may not literally design them, but they wouldn't
happen if he weren't CEO.<br><br>Steve is clever and driven, but so are a lot of people in the Valley.
What makes him unique is his 
<a href="taste.html">sense of 
design</a>.  Before him, most
companies treated design as a frivolous extra.  Apple's competitors
now know better.<br><br><b>2. TJ Rodgers</b><br><br>TJ Rodgers isn't as famous as Steve Jobs, but he may be the best
writer among Silicon Valley CEOs.  I've probably learned more from
him about the startup way of thinking than from anyone else.  Not
so much from specific things he's written as by reconstructing the
mind that produced them: brutally candid; aggressively garbage-collecting
outdated ideas; and yet driven by pragmatism rather than ideology.<br><br>The first essay of his that I read was so electrifying that I
remember exactly where I was at the time.  It was 
<a href="http://www.cypress.com/?rID=34993">High
Technology Innovation: Free Markets or Government Subsidies?</a> and
I was downstairs in the Harvard Square T Station.  It felt as if
someone had flipped on a light switch inside my head.<br><br><b>3. Larry &amp; Sergey</b><br><br>I'm sorry to treat Larry and Sergey as one person.  I've always
thought that was unfair to them.  But it does seem as if Google was a
collaboration.<br><br>Before Google, companies in Silicon Valley already knew it was
important to have the best hackers.  So they claimed, at least.
But Google pushed this idea further than anyone had before.  Their
hypothesis seems to have been that, in the initial stages at least,
<i>all</i> you need is good hackers: if you hire all the smartest people
and put them to work on a problem where their success can be measured,
you win.  All the other stuff—which includes all the stuff that
business schools think business consists of—you can figure out
along the way.  The results won't be perfect, but they'll be optimal.
If this was their hypothesis, it's now been verified experimentally.<br><br><b>4. Paul Buchheit</b><br><br>Few know this, but one person, Paul Buchheit, is responsible for
three of the best things Google has done.  He was the original
author of GMail, which is the most impressive thing Google has after
search.  He also wrote the first prototype of AdSense, and was the
author of Google's mantra "Don't be evil."<br><br>PB made a point in a talk once that I now mention to every startup
we fund: that it's better, initially, to make a small number of
users really love you than a large number kind of like you.   If I
could tell startups only 
<a href="13sentences.html">ten sentences</a>, 
this would be one of them.<br><br>Now he's cofounder of a startup called Friendfeed.  It's only a
year old, but already everyone in the Valley is watching them.
Someone responsible for three of the biggest ideas at Google is
going to come up with more.<br><br><b>5. Sam Altman</b><br><br>I was told I shouldn't mention founders of YC-funded companies in
this list.   But Sam Altman can't be stopped by such flimsy rules.
If he wants to be on this list, he's going to be.<br><br>Honestly, Sam is, along with Steve Jobs, the founder I refer to
most when I'm advising startups.  On questions of design, I ask
"What would Steve do?" but on questions of strategy or ambition I
ask "What would Sama do?"<br><br>What I learned from meeting Sama is that the doctrine of the elect
applies to startups.  It applies way less than most people think:
startup investing does not consist of trying to pick winners the
way you might in a horse race.  But there are a few people with
such force of will that they're going to get whatever they want.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

April 2009<br><br>I usually avoid politics, but since we now seem to have an administration that's open to suggestions, I'm going to risk making one.  The single biggest thing the government could do to increase the number of startups in this country is a policy that would cost nothing: establish a new class of visa for <nota 11="" 15="" 2006="" href="href=" http:="" venturebeat.com="" note-to-washington-about-half-of-vc-backed-company-founders-are-immigrants="" "="">startup founders.<br><br>The biggest constraint on the number of new startups that get created in the US is not tax policy or employment law or even Sarbanes-Oxley.  It's that we won't let the people who want to start them into the country.<br><br>Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy.  If we assume 4 people per startup, which is probably an overestimate, that's 2500 new companies.  <i>Each year.</i>  They wouldn't all grow as big as Google, but out of 2500 some would come close.<br><br>By definition these 10,000 founders wouldn't be taking jobs from Americans: it could be part of the terms of the visa that they couldn't work for existing companies, only new ones they'd founded.  In fact they'd cause there to be 
more jobs for Americans, because the companies they started would hire more employees as they grew.<br><br>The tricky part might seem to be how one defined a startup. But that could be solved quite easily: let the market decide.  Startup investors work hard to find the best startups.  The government could not do better than to piggyback on their expertise, and use investment by recognized startup investors as the test of whether a company was a real startup.<br><br>How would the government decide who's a startup investor?  The same way they decide what counts as a university for student visas. We'll establish our own accreditation procedure. We know who one another are.<br><br>10,000 people is a drop in the bucket by immigration standards, but would represent a huge increase in the pool of startup founders.  I think this would have such a visible effect on the economy that it would make the legislator who introduced the bill famous.  The only way to know for sure would be to try it, and that would cost practically nothing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

to ask why Twitter is such a big deal.<br><br>The reason is that it's a new messaging 
protocol, where you don't specify the recipients.
New protocols are rare.  Or more precisely, new
protocols that take off are.
There are only a handful of commonly used ones: TCP/IP 
(the Internet), SMTP (email), HTTP (the web), and so on.  So any
new protocol is a big deal.  But Twitter is a protocol owned
by a private company.  That's even rarer.<br><br>Curiously, the fact that the founders of Twitter 
have been slow to monetize it may in the long run
prove to be an advantage.  Because they haven't tried
to control it too much, Twitter feels to everyone like
previous protocols.  One forgets it's owned by a
private company.  That must have made it easier for
Twitter to spread.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

I'm not sure of this, but there seems a decent chance it's true.  People are dramatically more 
<nota href="wealth.html">productive as founders or early employees of startups—imagine how much less Larry and Sergey would have achieved if they'd gone to work for a big company—and that scale of improvement can change social customs.<br><br>The second idea is that startups are a type of business that flourishes in certain places that <a href="startuphubs.html">specialize</a> in it—that Silicon Valley specializes in startups in the same way Los Angeles specializes in movies, or New York in finance. <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>What if both are true?  What if startups are both a new economic phase and also a type of business that only flourishes in certain centers?<br><br>If so, this revolution is going to be particularly revolutionary. All previous revolutions have spread.  Agriculture, cities, and industrialization all spread widely. If startups end up being like the movie business, with just a handful of centers and one dominant one, that's going to have novel consequences.<br><br>There are already signs that startups may not spread particularly well.  The spread of startups seems to be proceeding slower than the spread of the Industrial Revolution, despite the fact that communication is so much faster now.<br><br>Within a few decades of the founding of Boulton &amp; Watt there were steam engines scattered over northern Europe and North America.  Industrialization didn't spread much beyond those regions for a while. It only spread to places where there was a strong middle class—countries where a private citizen could make a fortune without having it confiscated. Otherwise it wasn't worth investing in factories.  But in a country with a strong middle class it was easy for industrial techniques to take root.  An individual mine or factory owner could decide to install a steam engine, and within a few years he could probably find someone local to make him one.  So steam engines spread fast.  And they spread widely, because the locations of mines and factories were determined by features like rivers, harbors, and sources of raw materials. 
 <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Startups don't seem to spread so well, partly because they're more a social than a technical phenomenon, and partly because they're not tied to geography.  An individual European manufacturer could import industrial techniques and they'd work fine.  This doesn't seem to work so well with startups: you need a community of expertise, as you do in the movie business.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
 Plus there aren't the same forces driving startups to spread.  Once railroads or electric power grids were invented, every region had to have them.  An area without railroads or power was a rich potential market.  But this isn't true with startups.  There's no need for a Microsoft of France or Google of Germany.<br><br>Governments may decide they want to encourage startups locally, but government policy can't call them into being the way a genuine need could.<br><br>How will this all play out?  If I had to predict now, I'd say that startups will spread, but very slowly, because their spread will be driven not by government policies (which won't work) or by market need (which doesn't exist) but, to the extent that it happens at all, by the same random factors that have caused startup culture to spread thus far.  And such random factors will increasingly be outweighed by the pull of existing startup hubs.<br><br>Silicon Valley is where it is because William Shockley wanted to move back to Palo Alto, where he grew up, and the experts he lured west to work with him liked it so much they stayed.  Seattle owes much of its position as a tech center to the same cause: Gates and Allen wanted to move home.  Otherwise Albuquerque might have Seattle's place in the rankings.  Boston is a tech center because it's the intellectual capital of the US and probably the world.  And if Battery Ventures hadn't turned down Facebook, Boston would be significantly bigger now on the startup radar screen.<br><br>But of course it's not a coincidence that Facebook got funded in the Valley and not Boston.  There are more and bolder investors in Silicon Valley than in Boston, and even undergrads know it.<br><br>Boston's case illustrates the difficulty you'd have establishing a new startup hub this late in the game.  If you wanted to create a startup hub by reproducing the way existing ones happened, the 
<a href="siliconvalley.html">way to do it</a> would be to establish a first-rate research university in a place so nice that rich people wanted to live there.  Then the town would be hospitable to both groups you need: both founders and investors.  That's the combination that yielded Silicon Valley.  But Silicon Valley didn't have Silicon Valley to compete with.  If you tried now to create a startup hub by planting a great university in a nice place, it would have a harder time getting started, because many of the best startups it produced would be sucked away to existing startup hubs.<br><br>Recently I suggested a potential shortcut: 
<a href="maybe.html">pay startups to move</a>.  Once you had enough good startups in one place, it would create a self-sustaining chain reaction.  Founders would start to move there without being paid, because that was where their peers were, and investors would appear too, because that was where the deals were.<br><br>In practice I doubt any government would have the balls to try this, or the brains to do it right.  I didn't mean it as a practical suggestion, but more as an exploration of the lower bound of what it would take to create a startup hub deliberately.<br><br>The most likely scenario is (1) that no government will successfully establish a startup hub, and (2) that the spread of startup culture will thus be driven by the random factors that have driven it so far, but (3) that these factors will be increasingly outweighed by the pull of existing startup hubs.  Result: this revolution, if it is one, will be unusually localized.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
There are two very different types of startup: one kind that evolves naturally, and one kind that's called into being to "commercialize" a scientific discovery.  Most computer/software startups are now the first type, and most pharmaceutical startups the second.  When I talk about startups in this essay, I mean type I startups.  There is no difficulty making type II startups spread: all you have to do is fund medical research labs; commercializing whatever new discoveries the boffins throw off is as straightforward as building a new airport.  Type II startups neither require nor produce startup culture. But that means having type II startups won't get you type I startups.  Philadelphia is a case in point: lots of type II startups, but hardly any type I.<br><br>Incidentally, Google may appear to be an instance of a type II startup, but it wasn't.  Google is not pagerank commercialized.  They could have used another algorithm and everything would have turned out the same.  What made Google Google is that they cared about doing search well at a critical point in the evolution of the web.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
 Watt didn't invent the steam engine.  His critical invention was a refinement that made steam engines dramatically more efficient: the separate condenser.  But that oversimplifies his role.  He had such a different attitude to the problem and approached it with such energy that he transformed the field.  Perhaps the most accurate way to put it would be to say that Watt reinvented the steam engine.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The biggest counterexample here is Skype.  If you're doing
something that would get shut down in the US, it becomes an 
advantage to be located elsewhere.  That's why Kazaa took
the place of Napster.  And the expertise and connections the 
founders gained from running Kazaa helped ensure the success
of Skype.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, and Fred Wilson for reading drafts of this.<br><br></nota></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

July 2009<br><br>One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they're on
a different type of schedule from other people.  Meetings cost them
more.<br><br>There are two types of schedule, which I'll call the manager's
schedule and the maker's schedule.  The manager's schedule is for
bosses.  It's embodied in the traditional appointment book, with
each day cut into one hour intervals.  You can block off several
hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change
what you're doing every hour.<br><br>When you use time that way, it's merely a practical problem to meet
with someone.  Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, and
you're done.<br><br>Most powerful people are on the manager's schedule.  It's the
schedule of command.  But there's another way of using time that's
common among people who make things, like programmers and writers.
They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least.
You can't write or program well in units of an hour.  That's barely
enough time to get started.<br><br>When you're operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are a
disaster.  A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking
it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in.  Plus you
have to remember to go to the meeting.  That's no problem for someone
on the manager's schedule.  There's always something coming on the
next hour; the only question is what.  But when someone on the
maker's schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.<br><br>For someone on the maker's schedule, having a meeting is like
throwing an exception.  It doesn't merely cause you to switch from
one task to another; it changes the mode in which you work.<br><br>I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day.   A meeting
commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up a morning or
afternoon.  But in addition there's sometimes a cascading effect.
If I know the afternoon is going to be broken up, I'm slightly less
likely to start something ambitious in the morning.  I know this
may sound oversensitive, but if you're a maker, think of your own
case.  Don't your spirits rise at the thought of having an entire
day free to work, with no appointments at all?  Well, that means
your spirits are correspondingly depressed when you don't.  And
ambitious projects are by definition close to the limits of your
capacity.  A small decrease in morale is enough to kill them off.<br><br>Each type of schedule works fine by itself.  Problems arise when
they meet.  Since most powerful people operate on the manager's
schedule, they're in a position to make everyone resonate at their
frequency if they want to.  But the smarter ones restrain themselves,
if they know that some of the people working for them need long
chunks of time to work in.<br><br>Our case is an unusual one.  Nearly all investors, including all
VCs I know, operate on the manager's schedule.  But 
<a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>
runs on the maker's schedule.  Rtm and Trevor and I do because we
always have, and Jessica does too, mostly, because she's gotten
into sync with us.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if there start to be more companies like
us.  I suspect founders may increasingly be able to resist, or at
least postpone, turning into managers, just as a few decades ago
they started to be able to resist switching from jeans
to suits.<br><br>How do we manage to advise so many startups on the maker's schedule?
By using the classic device for simulating the manager's schedule
within the maker's: office hours.  Several times a week I set aside
a chunk of time to meet founders we've funded.  These chunks of
time are at the end of my working day, and I wrote a signup program
that ensures all the appointments within a given set of office hours
are clustered at the end.  Because they come at the end of my day
these meetings are never an interruption.  (Unless their working
day ends at the same time as mine, the meeting presumably interrupts
theirs, but since they made the appointment it must be worth it to
them.)  During busy periods, office hours sometimes get long enough
that they compress the day, but they never interrupt it.<br><br>
When we were working on <a href="start.html"><font color="#000099">our own startup</font></a>, back in the 90s, I evolved
another trick for partitioning the day.  I used to program from
dinner till about 3 am every day, because at night no one could
interrupt me.  Then I'd sleep till about 11 am, and come in and
work until dinner on what I called "business stuff."  I never thought
of it in these terms, but in effect I had two workdays each day,
one on the manager's schedule and one on the maker's.<br><br>When you're operating on the manager's schedule you can do something
you'd never want to do on the maker's: you can have speculative
meetings.  You can meet someone just to get to know one another.
If you have an empty slot in your schedule, why not?  Maybe it will
turn out you can help one another in some way.<br><br>Business people in Silicon Valley (and the whole world, for that
matter) have speculative meetings all the time.  They're effectively
free if you're on the manager's schedule.  They're so common that
there's distinctive language for proposing them: saying that you
want to "grab coffee," for example.<br><br>Speculative meetings are terribly costly if you're on the maker's
schedule, though.  Which puts us in something of a bind.  Everyone
assumes that, like other investors, we run on the manager's schedule.
So they introduce us to someone they think we ought to meet, or
send us an email proposing we grab coffee.  At this point we have
two options, neither of them good: we can meet with them, and lose
half a day's work; or we can try to avoid meeting them, and probably
offend them.<br><br>Till recently we weren't clear in our own minds about the source
of the problem.  We just took it for granted that we had to either
blow our schedules or offend people.  But now that I've realized
what's going on, perhaps there's a third option: to write something
explaining the two types of schedule.  Maybe eventually, if the
conflict between the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule
starts to be more widely understood, it will become less of a
problem.<br><br>Those of us on the maker's schedule are willing to compromise.   We
know we have to have some number of meetings.  All we ask from those
on the manager's schedule is that they understand the cost.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>
July 2009<br><br>Now that the term "ramen profitable" has become widespread, I ought
to explain precisely what the idea entails.<br><br>Ramen profitable means a startup makes just enough to pay the
founders' living expenses.  This is a different form of profitability
than startups have traditionally aimed for.  Traditional profitability
means a big bet is finally paying off, whereas the main importance
of ramen profitability is that it buys you time.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>In the past, a startup would usually become profitable only
after raising and spending quite a lot of money.  A company making
computer hardware might not become profitable for 5 years, during
which they spent $50 million.  But when they did
they might have revenues of $50 million a year.   This kind of
profitability means the startup has succeeded.<br><br>Ramen profitability is the other extreme: a startup that becomes
profitable after 2 months, even though its revenues are only $3000
a month, because the only employees are a couple 25 year old founders
who can live on practically nothing.  Revenues of $3000 a month do
not mean the company has succeeded.
But it does share something with the one
that's profitable in the traditional way: they don't need to raise
money to survive.<br><br>Ramen profitability is an unfamiliar idea to most people because
it only recently became feasible.  It's still not feasible for a
lot of startups; it would not be for most biotech startups, for
example; but it is for many software startups because they're now
so cheap.  For many, the only real cost is the founders'
living expenses.<br><br>The main significance of this type of profitability is that you're
no longer at the mercy of investors.  If you're still losing money,
then eventually you'll either have to raise more
or shut down.  Once you're
ramen profitable this painful choice goes away.
You can still raise money, but you don't have to do it now.<br><br></p><center>* * *</center><br><br>The most obvious advantage of not needing money is that
you can get better terms.  If investors know you need money, they'll
sometimes take advantage of you.  Some may even deliberately
stall, because they know that as you run out of money you'll become
increasingly pliable.<br><br>But there are also three less obvious advantages of ramen profitability.
One is that it makes you more attractive to investors.  If you're
already profitable, on however small a scale, it shows that (a) you
can get at least someone to pay you, (b) you're serious about
building things people want, and (c) you're disciplined enough to
keep expenses low.<br><br>This is reassuring to investors, because you've addressed three of
their biggest worries.  It's common for them to fund companies that
have smart founders and a big market, and yet still fail.  When
these companies fail, it's usually because (a) people wouldn't pay
for what they made, e.g. because it was too hard to sell to them,
or the market wasn't ready yet, (b) the founders solved the wrong
problem, instead of paying attention to what users needed, or (c)
the company spent too much and burned through their funding before
they started to make money.  If you're ramen profitable, you're
already avoiding these mistakes.<br><br>Another advantage of ramen profitability is that it's good for
morale.  A company
tends to feel rather theoretical when you first start it.  It's
legally a company, but you feel like you're lying when you call it
one.  When people start to pay you significant amounts, the company
starts to feel real.  And your own living expenses are the milestone
you feel most, because at that point the future flips state.  Now
survival is the default, instead of dying.<br><br>A morale boost on that scale is very valuable in a startup, because
the moral weight of running a startup is what makes it hard.  Startups
are still very rare.  Why don't more people do it?  The financial
risk?  Plenty of 25 year olds save nothing anyway.  The long hours?
Plenty of people work just as long hours in regular jobs. What keeps
people from starting startups is the fear of having so much
responsibility.  And this is not an irrational fear: it really is
hard to bear.  Anything that takes some of that weight off you will 
greatly increase your chances of surviving.<br><br>A startup that reaches ramen profitability may be more likely
to succeed than not.  Which is pretty exciting, considering the
bimodal distribution of outcomes in startups: you either fail or
make a lot of money.<br><br>The fourth advantage of ramen profitability is the least obvious
but may be the most important.  If you don't need to raise money,
you don't have to interrupt working on the company to do it.<br><br><a href="fundraising.html">Raising money</a> is terribly distracting.  
You're lucky if your
productivity is a third of what it was before.  And it can last for
months.<br><br>I didn't understand (or rather, remember) precisely why raising
money was so distracting till earlier this year.  I'd noticed that
startups we funded would usually grind to a halt when they switched
to raising money, but I didn't remember exactly why till YC raised
money itself.  We had a comparatively easy time of it; the first
people I asked said yes; but it took months to work out the
details, and during that time I got hardly any real work done.  Why?
Because I thought about it all the time.<br><br>At any given time there tends to be one problem that's the most
urgent for a startup.  This is what you think about as you fall
asleep at night and when you take a shower in the morning.  And
when you start raising money, that becomes the problem you think
about.  You only take one shower in the morning, and if you're
thinking about investors during it, then you're not thinking about
the product.<br><br>Whereas if you can choose when you raise money, you can pick a time
when you're not in the middle of something else, and you can probably
also insist that the round close fast.  You may even be able to
avoid having the round occupy your thoughts, if you don't care
whether it closes.<br><br><center>* * *</center><br><br>Ramen profitable means no more than the definition implies.  It
does not, for example, imply that you're "bootstrapping" the
startup—that you're never going to take money from investors.
Empirically that doesn't seem to work very well.  Few startups
succeed without taking investment.  Maybe as startups get cheaper
it will become more common.  On the other hand, the money is there,
waiting to be invested.  If startups need it less, they'll be able
to get it on better terms, which will make them more inclined to
take it.  That will tend to produce an equilibrium.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another thing ramen profitability doesn't imply is Joe Kraus's idea
that you should put your 
<a href="http://www.brendonwilson.com/blog/2006/04/30/joe-kraus-confessions-of-a-startup-addict/">business model</a> in beta when you put your
product in beta.  He believes you should get
people to pay you from the beginning.  I think that's too constraining.
Facebook didn't, and they've done better than most startups.  Making
money right away was not only unnecessary for them, but probably
would have been harmful.  I do think Joe's rule could be useful for
many startups, though.  When founders seem unfocused, I sometimes
suggest they try to get customers to pay them for something, in the
hope that this constraint will prod them into action.<br><br>The difference between Joe's idea and ramen profitability is that
a ramen profitable company doesn't have to be making money the way
it ultimately will.  It just has to be making money.  The most
famous example is Google, which initially made money by licensing
search to sites like Yahoo.<br><br>Is there a downside to ramen profitability?  Probably the biggest
danger is that it might turn you into a consulting firm.  Startups
have to be product companies, in the sense of making a single thing
that everyone uses.  The defining quality of startups is that they
grow fast, and consulting just can't scale the way a product can.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
But it's pretty easy to make $3000 a month consulting; in
fact, that would be a low rate for contract programming.  So there
could be a temptation to slide into consulting, and telling
yourselves you're a ramen profitable startup, when in fact
you're not a startup at all.<br><br>It's ok to do a little consulting-type work at first.  Startups
usually have to do something weird at first.  But remember
that ramen profitability is not the destination.  A startup's
destination is to grow really big; ramen profitability is a trick
for <a href="die.html">not dying</a> en route.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
The "ramen" in "ramen profitable" refers to instant ramen,
which is just about the cheapest food available.<br><br>Please do not take the term literally.  Living on instant ramen
would be very unhealthy.  Rice and beans are a better source of
food.  Start by investing in a rice cooker, if you don't have one.<br><br>Rice and Beans for 2n
<pre>  olive oil or butter
  n yellow onions
  other fresh vegetables; experiment
  3n cloves garlic
  n 12-oz cans white, kidney, or black beans
  n cubes Knorr beef or vegetable bouillon
  n teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
  3n teaspoons ground cumin
  n cups dry rice, preferably brown
</pre>
Put rice in rice cooker. Add water as specified on rice package.
(Default: 2 cups water per cup of rice.) Turn on rice cooker and
forget about it.<br><br>Chop onions and other vegetables and fry in oil, over fairly low
heat, till onions are glassy. Put in chopped garlic, pepper, cumin,
and a little more fat, and stir.  Keep heat low. Cook another 2 or
3 minutes, then add beans (don't drain the beans), and stir. Throw
in the bouillon cube(s), cover, and cook on lowish heat for at least
10 minutes more. Stir vigilantly to avoid sticking.<br><br>If you want to save money, buy beans in giant cans from discount
stores.  Spices are also much cheaper when bought in bulk.
If there's an Indian grocery store near you, they'll have big 
bags of cumin for the same price as the little jars in supermarkets.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There's a good chance that a shift in power from investors
to founders would actually increase the size of the venture business.
I think investors currently err too far on the side of being harsh
to founders.  If they were forced to stop, the whole venture business
would work better, and you might see something like the increase
in trade you always see when restrictive laws are removed.<br><br>Investors
are one of the biggest sources of pain for founders; if they stopped
causing so much pain, it would be better to be a founder; and if
it were better to be a founder, more people would do it.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]

consulting into a form that would scale.  But if they did that

There are several reasons why, but one is that people don't want
to be seen riding them. Someone riding a Segway looks like a dork.<br><br>My friend Trevor Blackwell built 
<a href="http://tlb.org/#scooter">his own Segway</a>, 
which we called
the Segwell. He also built a one-wheeled version, 
<a href="http://tlb.org/#eunicycle">the Eunicycle</a>,
which looks exactly like a regular unicycle till you realize the
rider isn't pedaling.  He has ridden them both to downtown Mountain
View to get coffee.  When he rides the Eunicycle, people smile at
him.  But when he rides the Segwell, they shout abuse from their
cars: "Too lazy to walk, ya fuckin homo?"<br><br>Why do Segways provoke this reaction?  The reason you look like a
dork riding a Segway is that you look <i>smug</i>.  You don't seem to
be working hard enough.<br><br>Someone riding a motorcycle isn't working any harder. But because
he's sitting astride it, he seems to be making an effort.  When
you're riding a Segway you're just standing there.  And someone who's
being whisked along while seeming to do no work — someone in a sedan
chair, for example — can't help but look smug.<br><br>Try this thought experiment and it becomes clear: imagine something
that worked like the Segway, but that you rode with one foot in
front of the other, like a skateboard.  That wouldn't seem nearly
as uncool.<br><br>So there may be a way to capture more of the market Segway hoped
to reach: make a version that doesn't look so easy for the rider.
It would also be helpful if the styling was in the tradition of
skateboards or bicycles rather than medical devices.<br><br>Curiously enough, what got Segway into this problem was that the
company was itself a kind of Segway.  It was too easy for them;
they were too successful raising money.  If they'd had to grow the
company gradually, by iterating through several versions they sold
to real users, they'd have learned pretty quickly that people looked
stupid riding them. Instead they had enough to work in secret.  They
had focus groups aplenty, I'm sure, but they didn't have the people
yelling insults out of cars.  So they never realized they were
zooming confidently down a blind alley.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

Recently we managed to recruit her to help us run YC when she's not
busy with architectural projects.  Though she'd heard a lot about
YC since the beginning, the last 9 months have been a total immersion.<br><br>I've been around the startup world for so long that it seems normal
to me, so I was curious to hear what had surprised her most about
it.  This was her list:<br><br><br><br><b>1. How many startups fail.</b><br><br>Kate knew in principle that startups
were very risky, but she was surprised to see how constant the
threat of failure was — not just for the minnows, but even for the
famous startups whose founders came to speak at YC dinners.<br><br>
<b>2. How much startups' ideas change.</b><br><br>As usual, by Demo Day about
half the startups were doing something significantly different than
they started with.  We encourage that.  Starting a startup is like
science in that you have to follow the truth wherever it leads.  In
the rest of the world, people don't start things till they're sure
what they want to do, and once started they tend to continue on their
initial path even if it's mistaken.<br><br>
<b>3. How little money it can take to start a startup.</b><br><br>In Kate's
world, everything is still physical and expensive.  You can barely
renovate a bathroom for the cost of starting a startup.<br><br>
<b>4. How scrappy founders are.</b><br><br>That was her actual word.  I agree
with her, but till she mentioned this it never occurred to me how
little this quality is appreciated in most of the rest of the world.
It wouldn't be a compliment in most organizations to call someone
scrappy.<br><br>What does it mean, exactly?  It's basically the diminutive form of
belligerent.  Someone who's scrappy manages to be both threatening
and undignified at the same time.   Which seems to me exactly what
one would want to be, in any kind of work.  If you're not threatening,
you're probably not doing anything new, and dignity is merely a
sort of plaque.<br><br>
<b>5. How tech-saturated Silicon Valley is.</b><br><br>"It seems like everybody
here is in the industry."  That isn't literally true, but there is
a qualitative difference between Silicon Valley and other places.
You tend to keep your voice down, because there's a good chance the
person at the next table would know some of the people you're talking
about.  I never felt that in Boston.  The good news is, there's
also a good chance the person at the next table could help you in
some way.<br><br>
<b>6. That the speakers at YC were so consistent in their advice.</b><br><br>
Actually, I've noticed this too.  I always worry the speakers will
put us in an embarrassing position by contradicting what we tell the
startups, but it happens surprisingly rarely.<br><br>When I asked her what specific things she remembered speakers always
saying, she mentioned: that the way to succeed was to launch something
fast, listen to users, and then iterate; that startups required
resilience because they were always an emotional rollercoaster; and
that most VCs were sheep.<br><br>I've been impressed by how consistently the speakers advocate
launching fast and iterating.  That was contrarian advice 10 years
ago, but it's clearly now the established practice.<br><br>
<b>7. How casual successful startup founders are.</b><br><br>Most of the famous
founders in Silicon Valley are people you'd overlook on the street.
It's not merely that they don't dress up.  They don't project any
kind of aura of power either.  "They're not trying to impress
anyone."<br><br>Interestingly, while Kate said that she could never pick out
successful founders, she could recognize VCs, both by the way they
dressed and the way they carried themselves.<br><br>
<b>8. How important it is for founders to have people to ask for advice.</b><br><br>(I swear I didn't prompt this one.)  Without advice "they'd just
be sort of lost."  Fortunately, there are a lot of people to help
them.  There's a strong tradition within YC of helping other YC-funded
startups.  But we didn't invent that idea: it's just a slightly
more concentrated form of existing Valley culture.<br><br>
<b>9. What a solitary task startups are.</b><br><br>Architects are constantly
interacting face to face with other people, whereas doing a technology
startup, at least, tends to require long stretches of uninterrupted
time to work.  "You could do it in a box."<br><br><br><br>By inverting this list, we can get a portrait of the "normal" world.
It's populated by people who talk a lot with one another as they
work slowly but harmoniously on conservative, expensive projects
whose destinations are decided in advance, and who carefully adjust
their manner to reflect their position in the hierarchy.<br><br>That's also a fairly accurate description of the past.  So startup
culture may not merely be different in the way you'd expect any
subculture to be, but a leading indicator.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://note.com/tokyojack/n/n00714ac4042a">Japanese Translation</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
September 2009<br><br>Like all investors, we spend a lot of time trying to learn how to
predict which startups will succeed.  We probably spend more time
thinking about it than most, because we invest the earliest.
Prediction is usually all we have to rely on.<br><br>We learned quickly that the most important predictor of success is
determination.  At first we thought it might be intelligence.
Everyone likes to believe that's what makes startups succeed.  It
makes a better story that a company won because its founders were
so smart.  The PR people and reporters who spread such stories
probably believe them themselves.  But while it certainly helps to
be smart, it's not the deciding factor.  There are plenty of people
as smart as Bill Gates who achieve nothing.<br><br>In most domains, talent is overrated compared to determination—partly
because it makes a better story, partly because it gives onlookers
an excuse for being lazy, and partly because after a while determination
starts to look like talent.<br><br>I can't think of any field in which determination is overrated, but
the relative importance of determination and talent probably do
vary somewhat.  Talent probably matters more in types of work that
are purer, in the sense that one is solving mostly a single type
of problem instead of many different types.   I suspect determination
would not take you as far in math as it would in, say, organized
crime.<br><br>I don't mean to suggest by this comparison that types of work that
depend more on talent are always more admirable.  Most people would
agree it's more admirable to be good at math than memorizing long
strings of digits, even though the latter depends more on natural
ability.<br><br>Perhaps one reason people believe startup founders win by being
smarter is that intelligence does matter more in technology startups
than it used to in earlier types of companies.  You probably do
need to be a bit smarter to dominate Internet search than you had
to be to dominate railroads or hotels or newspapers.  And that's
probably an ongoing trend.  But even in the highest of high tech
industries, success still depends more on determination than brains.<br><br>If determination is so important, can we isolate its components?
Are some more important than others?  Are there some you can
cultivate?<br><br>The simplest form of determination is sheer willfulness.  When you
want something, you must have it, no matter what.<br><br>A good deal of willfulness must be inborn, because it's common to
see families where one sibling has much more of it than another.
Circumstances can alter it, but at the high end of the scale, nature
seems to be more important than nurture.  Bad circumstances can
break the spirit of a strong-willed person, but I don't think there's
much you can do to make a weak-willed person stronger-willed.<br><br>Being strong-willed is not enough, however.  You also have to be
hard on yourself.  Someone who was strong-willed but self-indulgent
would not be called determined.  Determination implies your willfulness
is balanced by discipline.<br><br>That word balance is a significant one.  The more willful you are,
the more disciplined you have to be.  The stronger your will, the
less anyone will be able to argue with you except yourself.  And
someone has to argue with you, because everyone has base impulses,
and if you have more will than discipline you'll just give into
them and end up on a local maximum like drug addiction.<br><br>We can imagine will and discipline as two fingers squeezing a
slippery melon seed.  The harder they squeeze, the further the seed
flies, but they must both squeeze equally or the seed spins off
sideways.<br><br>If this is true it has interesting implications, because discipline
can be cultivated, and in fact does tend to vary quite a lot in the
course of an individual's life.  If determination is effectively
the product of will and discipline, then you can become more
determined by being more disciplined.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another consequence of the melon seed model is that the more willful
you are, the more dangerous it is to be undisciplined.  There seem
to be plenty of examples to confirm that.  In some very energetic
people's lives you see something like wing flutter, where they
alternate between doing great work and doing absolutely nothing.
Externally this would look a lot like bipolar disorder.<br><br>The melon seed model is inaccurate in at least one respect, however:
it's static.  In fact the dangers of indiscipline increase with
temptation.  Which means, interestingly, that determination tends
to erode itself.  If you're sufficiently determined to achieve great
things, this will probably increase the number of temptations around
you.  Unless you become proportionally more disciplined, willfulness
will then get the upper hand, and your achievement will revert to
the mean.<br><br>That's why Shakespeare's Caesar thought thin men so dangerous.  They weren't
tempted by the minor perquisites of power.<br><br>The melon seed model implies it's possible to be too disciplined.
Is it?  I think there probably are people whose willfulness is
crushed down by excessive discipline, and who would achieve more
if they weren't so hard on themselves.  One reason the young sometimes
succeed where the old fail is that they don't realize how incompetent
they are.  This lets them do a kind of deficit spending.  When they
first start working on something, they overrate their achievements.
But that gives them confidence to keep working, and their performance
improves.  Whereas someone clearer-eyed would see their initial
incompetence for what it was, and perhaps be discouraged from
continuing.<br><br>There's one other major component of determination: ambition.  If
willfulness and discipline are what get you to your destination,
ambition is how you choose it.<br><br>I don't know if it's exactly right to say that ambition is a component
of determination, but they're not entirely orthogonal.  It would
seem a misnomer if someone said they were very determined to do
something trivially easy.<br><br>And fortunately ambition seems to be quite malleable; there's a lot
you can do to increase it.  Most people don't know how ambitious
to be, especially when they're young.  They don't know what's hard,
or what they're capable of.  And this problem is exacerbated by
having few peers.  Ambitious people are rare, so if everyone is
mixed together randomly, as they tend to be early in people's lives,
then the ambitious ones won't have many ambitious peers.  When you
take people like this and put them together with other ambitious
people, they bloom like dying plants given water.  Probably most
ambitious people are starved for the sort of encouragement they'd
get from ambitious peers, whatever their age.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Achievements also tend to increase your ambition.  With each step
you gain confidence to stretch further next time.<br><br>So here in sum is how determination seems to work: it consists of
willfulness balanced with discipline, aimed by ambition.   And
fortunately at least two of these three qualities can be cultivated.
You may be able to increase your strength of will somewhat; you can
definitely learn self-discipline; and almost everyone is practically
malnourished when it comes to ambition.<br><br>I feel like I understand determination a bit better now.  But only
a bit: willfulness, discipline, and ambition are all concepts almost
as complicated as determination.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Note too that determination and talent are not the whole story.
There's a third factor in achievement: how much you like the work.
If you really <a href="love.html">love</a> working on something,
you don't need determination to drive you; it's what you'd do anyway.
But most types of work have aspects one doesn't like, because most
types of work consist of doing things for other people, and it's
very unlikely that the tasks imposed by their needs will happen to
align exactly with what you want to do.<br><br>Indeed, if you want to create the most <a href="wealth.html">wealth</a>,
the way to do it is to focus more on their needs than your interests,
and make up the difference with determination.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Loosely speaking.  What I'm claiming with the melon seed model
is more like determination is proportionate to wd^m - k|w - d|^n,
where w is will and d discipline.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Which means one of the best ways to help a society generally
is to create <a href="http://startupschool.org">events</a> and <a href="http://ycombinator.com">institutions</a> that bring ambitious
people together.  It's like pulling the control rods out of a
reactor: the energy they emit encourages other ambitious people,
instead of being absorbed by the normal people they're usually
surrounded with.<br><br>Conversely, it's probably a mistake to do as some European countries
have done and try to ensure none of your universities is significantly
better than the others.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
For example, willfulness clearly has two subcomponents,
stubbornness and energy.  The first alone yields someone who's
stubbornly inert.  The second alone yields someone flighty.
As willful people get older or otherwise lose their energy, they
tend to become merely stubborn.<br><br>

whose title begins with a number. "7 Things He Won't Tell You about
Sex," or something like that.  Some popular magazines
feature articles of this type on the cover of every
issue.  That can't be happening by accident.  Editors must know
they attract readers.<br><br>Why do readers like the list of n things so much?   Mainly because
it's easier to read than a regular article.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
Structurally, the list of n things is a degenerate case of essay.
An essay can go anywhere the writer wants.  In a list of n things
the writer agrees to constrain himself to a collection of points
of roughly equal importance, and he tells the reader explicitly
what they are.<br><br>Some of the work of reading an article is understanding its
structure—figuring out what in high school we'd have called
its "outline." Not explicitly, of course, but someone who really
understands an article probably has something in his brain afterward
that corresponds to such an outline.  In a list of n things, this
work is done for you.  Its structure is an exoskeleton.<br><br>As well as being explicit, the structure is guaranteed to be of the
simplest possible type: a few main points with few to no subordinate
ones, and no particular connection between them.<br><br>Because the main points are unconnected, the list of n things is
random access.  There's no thread of reasoning you have to follow.  You could
read the list in any order.  And because the points are independent
of one another, they work like watertight compartments in an
unsinkable ship.  If you get bored with, or can't understand, or
don't agree with one point, you don't have to give up on the article.
You can just abandon that one and skip to the next.  A list of n
things is parallel and therefore fault tolerant.<br><br>There are times when this format is what a writer wants.  One, obviously,
is when what you have to say actually is a list of n
things.  I once wrote an essay about the <a href="startupmistakes.html">mistakes that kill startups</a>, and a few people made fun of me
for writing something whose title began with a number.  But in that
case I really was trying to make a complete catalog of a number of
independent things.  In fact, one of the questions I was trying to
answer was how many there were.<br><br>There are other less legitimate reasons for using this format.  For
example, I use it when I get close to a deadline.  If I have to
give a talk and I haven't started it a few days beforehand, I'll
sometimes play it safe and make the talk a list of n things.<br><br>The list of n things is easier for writers as well as readers.  When
you're writing a real essay, there's always a chance you'll hit a
dead end.  A real essay is a train of thought, and some trains of
thought just peter out.  That's an alarming possibility when you
have to give a talk in a few days.  What if you run out of ideas?
The compartmentalized structure of the list of n things protects
the writer from his own stupidity in much the same way it protects
the reader.  If you run out of ideas on one point, no problem: it
won't kill the essay.  You can take out the whole point if you need
to, and the essay will still survive.<br><br>Writing a list of n things is so relaxing.  You think of n/2 of
them in the first 5 minutes.  So bang, there's the structure, and
you just have to fill it in.  As you think of more points, you just
add them to the end.  Maybe you take out or rearrange or combine a
few, but at every stage you have a valid (though initially low-res)
list of n things.  It's like the sort of programming where you write
a version 1 very quickly and then gradually modify it, but at every
point have working code—or the style of painting where you begin
with a complete but very blurry sketch done in an hour, then spend
a week cranking up the resolution.<br><br>Because the list of n things is easier for writers too, it's not
always a damning sign when readers prefer it.  It's not necessarily
evidence readers are lazy; it could also mean they don't have
much confidence in the writer.  The list of n things is in that
respect the cheeseburger of essay forms.  If you're eating at a
restaurant you suspect is bad, your best bet is to order the
cheeseburger.  Even a bad cook can make a decent cheeseburger.  And
there are pretty strict conventions about what a cheeseburger should
look like.  You can assume the cook isn't going to try something
weird and artistic.  The list of n things similarly limits the
damage that can be done by a bad writer.  You know it's going to
be about whatever the title says, and the format prevents the writer
from indulging in any flights of fancy.<br><br>Because the list of n things is the easiest essay form, it should
be a good one for beginning writers.  And in fact it is what most
beginning writers are taught.  The classic 5 paragraph essay is
really a list of n things for n = 3.  But the students writing them
don't realize they're using the same structure as the articles they
read in <i>Cosmopolitan</i>. They're not allowed to include the numbers,
and they're expected to spackle over the gaps with gratuitous
transitions ("Furthermore...") and cap the thing at either end with
introductory and concluding paragraphs so it will look superficially
like a real essay.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>It seems a fine plan to start students off with the list of n things.
It's the easiest form.  But if we're going to do that, why not do
it openly?  Let them write lists of n things like the pros, with
numbers and no transitions or "conclusion."<br><br>There is one case where the list of n things is a dishonest format:
when you use it to attract attention by falsely claiming the list
is an exhaustive one.  I.e. if you write an article that purports
to be about <i>the</i> 7 secrets of success.  That kind of title is the
same sort of reflexive challenge as a whodunit. You have to at least
look at the article to check whether they're the same 7 you'd list.
Are you overlooking one of the secrets of success?  Better check.<br><br>It's fine to put "The" before the number if you really believe
you've made an exhaustive list.  But evidence suggests most things
with titles like this are linkbait.<br><br>The greatest weakness of the list of n things is that there's so
little room for new thought.  The main point of essay writing, when
done right, is the new ideas you have while doing it.  A real essay,
as the name implies, is 
<a href="essay.html">dynamic</a>: you don't know what you're going
to write when you start.  It will be about whatever you discover
in the course of writing it.<br><br>This can only happen in a very limited way in a list of n things.
You make the title first, and that's what it's going to be about.
You can't have more new ideas in the writing than will fit in the
watertight compartments you set up initially.  And your brain seems
to know this: because you don't have room for new ideas, you don't
have them.<br><br>Another advantage of admitting to beginning writers that the 5
paragraph essay is really a list of n things is that we can warn
them about this.  It only lets you experience the defining
characteristic of essay writing on a small scale: in thoughts of a
sentence or two.  And it's particularly dangerous that the 5 paragraph
essay buries the list of n things within something that looks like
a more sophisticated type of essay.  If you don't know you're using
this form, you don't know you need to escape it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Articles of this type are also startlingly popular on Delicious,
but I think that's because 
<a href="http://delicious.com/popular">delicious/popular</a> 
is driven by bookmarking,
not because Delicious users are stupid.  Delicious users are
collectors, and a list of n things seems particularly collectible
because it's a collection itself.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Most "word problems" in school math textbooks are similarly
misleading.  They look superficially like the application of math
to real problems, but they're not.  So if anything they reinforce
the impression that math is merely a complicated but pointless
collection of stuff to be memorized.<br><br><br><br><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://iggant.blogspot.com/2009/09/n-paul-graham-list-of-n-things.html">Russian Translation</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

consumers won't pay for content anymore.  At least, that's how they
see it.<br><br>In fact consumers never really were paying for content, and publishers
weren't really selling it either.  If the content was what they
were selling, why has the price of books or music or movies always
depended mostly on the format?  Why didn't better content cost more?
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>A copy of <i>Time</i> costs $5 for 58 pages, or 8.6 cents a page.  
<i>The Economist</i> costs $7 for 86 pages, or 8.1 cents a page.  Better
journalism is actually slightly cheaper.<br><br>Almost every form of publishing has been organized as if the medium
was what they were selling, and the content was irrelevant.  Book
publishers, for example, set prices based on the cost of producing
and distributing books.  They treat the words printed in the book
the same way a textile manufacturer treats the patterns printed on
its fabrics.<br><br>Economically, the print media are in the business of marking up
paper.  We can all imagine an old-style editor getting a scoop and
saying "this will sell a lot of papers!" Cross out that final S and
you're describing their business model.  The reason they make less
money now is that people don't need as much paper.<br><br>A few months ago I ran into a friend in a cafe.  I had a copy of
the <i>New York Times</i>, which I still occasionally buy on weekends.  As
I was leaving I offered it to him, as I've done countless times
before in the same situation.  But this time something new happened.
I felt that sheepish feeling you get when you offer someone something
worthless.  "Do you, er, want a printout of yesterday's news?" I
asked.  (He didn't.)<br><br>Now that the medium is evaporating, publishers have nothing left
to sell.  Some seem to think they're going to sell content—that
they were always in the content business, really.  But they weren't,
and it's unclear whether anyone could be.<br><br><b>Selling</b><br><br>There have always been people in the business of selling information,
but that has historically been a distinct business from publishing.
And the business of selling information to consumers has always
been a marginal one.  When I was a kid there were people who used
to sell newsletters containing stock tips, printed on colored paper
that made them hard for the copiers of the day to reproduce.  That
is a different world, both culturally and economically, from the
one publishers currently inhabit.<br><br>People will pay for information they think they can make money from.
That's why they paid for those stock tip newsletters, and why
companies pay now for Bloomberg terminals and Economist Intelligence
Unit reports.  But will people pay for information otherwise?
History offers little encouragement.<br><br>If audiences were willing to pay more for better content, why wasn't
anyone already selling it to them?  There was no reason you couldn't
have done that in the era of physical media.  So were the print
media and the music labels simply overlooking this opportunity?  Or
is it, rather, nonexistent?<br><br>What about iTunes?  Doesn't that show people will pay for content?
Well, not really. iTunes is more of a tollbooth than a store.  Apple
controls the default path onto the iPod.  They offer a convenient
list of songs, and whenever you choose one they ding your credit
card for a small amount, just below the threshold of attention.
Basically, iTunes makes money by taxing people, not selling them
stuff.  You can only do that if you own the channel, and even then
you don't make much from it, because a toll has to be ignorable to
work.  Once a toll becomes painful, people start to find ways around
it, and that's pretty easy with digital content.<br><br>The situation is much the same with digital books.  Whoever controls
the device sets the terms.  It's in their interest for content to
be as cheap as possible, and since they own the channel, there's a
lot they can do to drive prices down.  Prices will fall even further
once writers realize they don't need publishers.  Getting a book
printed and distributed is a daunting prospect for a writer, but
most can upload a file.<br><br>Is software a counterexample?  People pay a lot for desktop software,
and that's just information.  True, but I don't think publishers
can learn much from software.  Software companies can charge a lot
because (a) many of the customers are businesses, who get in 
<a href="http://www.bsa.org/country/News%20and%20Events/News%20Archives/en/2009/en-08312009-mueller.aspx?sc_lang=en">trouble</a>
if they use pirated versions, and (b) though in form merely
information, software is treated by both maker and purchaser as a
different type of thing from a song or an article.   A Photoshop
user needs Photoshop in a way that no one needs a particular song
or article.<br><br>That's why there's a separate word, "content," for information
that's not software.  Software is a different business.  Software
and content blur together in some of the most lightweight software,
like casual games.  But those are usually free.   To make money the
way software companies do, publishers would have to become software
companies, and being publishers gives them no particular head start
in that domain. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The most promising countertrend is the premium cable channel.  People
still pay for those.  But broadcasting isn't publishing: you're not
selling a copy of something.  That's one reason the movie business
hasn't seen their revenues decline the way the news and music
businesses have.  They only have one foot in publishing.<br><br>To the extent the movie business can avoid becoming publishers,
they may avoid publishing's problems.  But there are limits to how
well they'll be able to do that.  Once publishing—giving people
copies—becomes the most natural way of distributing your content,
it probably doesn't work to stick to old forms of distribution just
because you make more that way.  If free copies of your content are
available online, then you're competing with publishing's form of
distribution, and that's just as bad as being a publisher.<br><br>Apparently some people in the music business hope to retroactively
convert it away from publishing, by getting listeners to pay for
subscriptions.  It seems unlikely that will work if they're just
streaming the same files you can get as mp3s.<br><br><b>Next</b><br><br>What happens to publishing if you can't sell content?  You have two
choices: give it away and make money from it indirectly, or find
ways to embody it in things people will pay for.<br><br>The first is probably the future of most current media.  
<a href="http://thesixtyone.com">Give music
away</a> and make money from concerts and t-shirts.  Publish articles
for free and make money from one of a dozen permutations of
advertising.  Both publishers and investors are down on advertising
at the moment, but it has more potential than they realize.<br><br>I'm not claiming that potential will be realized by the existing
players.  The <a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs1.html">optimal</a>
ways to make money from the written word
probably require different words written by different people.<br><br>It's harder to say what will happen to movies.  They could evolve
into ads.  Or they could return to their roots and make going to
the theater a treat.  If they made the experience good enough,
audiences might start to prefer it to watching pirated movies at
home. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Or maybe the movie business will dry up, and the people
working in it will go to work for game developers.<br><br>I don't know how big embodying information in physical form will
be.  It may be surprisingly large; people overvalue 
<a href="stuff.html">physical stuff</a>.
There should remain some market for printed books, at least.<br><br>I can see the evolution of book publishing in the books on my
shelves.  Clearly at some point in the 1960s the big publishing
houses started to ask: how cheaply can we make books before people
refuse to buy them?  The answer turned out to be one step short of
phonebooks.  As long as it isn't floppy, consumers still perceive
it as a book.<br><br>That worked as long as buying printed books was the only way to
read them.  If printed books are optional, publishers will have to
work harder to entice people to buy them.  There should be some
market, but it's hard to foresee how big, because its size will
depend not on macro trends like the amount people read, but on the
ingenuity of individual publishers. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Some magazines may thrive by focusing on the magazine as a physical
object.  Fashion magazines could be made lush in a way that would
be hard to match digitally, at least for a while.  But this is
probably not an option for most magazines.<br><br>I don't know exactly what the future will look like, but I'm not
too worried about it.  This sort of change tends to create as many
good things as it kills.  Indeed, the really interesting question is not
what will happen to existing forms, but what new forms will appear.<br><br>The reason I've been writing about existing forms is that I don't
<i>know</i> what new forms will appear.  But though I can't predict
specific winners, I can offer a recipe for recognizing them.  When
you see something that's taking advantage of new technology to give
people something they want that they couldn't have before, you're
probably looking at a winner.  And when you see something that's
merely reacting to new technology in an attempt to preserve some
existing source of revenue, you're probably looking at a loser.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I don't like the word "content" and tried for a while to avoid
using it, but I have to admit there's no other word that means the
right thing.  "Information" is too general.<br><br>Ironically, the main reason I don't like "content" is the thesis
of this essay.  The word suggests an undifferentiated slurry, but
economically that's how both publishers and audiences treat it.
Content is information you don't need.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Some types of publishers would be at a disadvantage trying
to enter the software business.  Record labels, for example, would
probably find it more natural to expand into casinos than software,
because the kind of people who run them would be more at home at
the mafia end of the business spectrum than the don't-be-evil end.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
I never watch movies in theaters anymore.  The tipping point
for me was the ads they show first.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Unfortunately, making physically nice books will only be a
niche within a niche.  Publishers are more likely to resort to
expedients like selling autographed copies, or editions with the
buyer's picture on the cover.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Michael Arrington, Trevor Blackwell, Steven Levy, Robert

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><div><div><div></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></div><div><br><br><div><h1 id="discover">Persuade xor Discover </h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">September 2009<br><br>When meeting people you don't know very well, the convention is
to seem extra friendly.  You smile and say "pleased to meet you,"
whether you are or not.  There's nothing dishonest about this.
Everyone knows that these little social lies aren't meant
to be taken literally, just as everyone knows that 
"Can you pass the salt?" is only grammatically a question.<br><br>I'm perfectly willing to smile and say "pleased to meet you"
when meeting new people.  But there is another set of 
customs for being ingratiating in print that are not so
harmless.<br><br>The reason there's a convention of being ingratiating in print
is that most essays are written to persuade.
And as any politician could tell
you, the way to persuade people is not just to baldly state the
facts.  You have to add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine
go down.<br><br>For example, a politician announcing the cancellation of 
a government program will not merely say "The
program is canceled." That would seem offensively
curt.  Instead he'll spend most of his time talking about the
noble effort made by the people who worked on it.<br><br>The reason these conventions are more dangerous is that they
interact with the ideas.  Saying "pleased to meet you" is just
something you prepend to a conversation, but the sort of spin 
added by politicians is woven through it.  We're starting to
move from social lies to real lies.<br><br>Here's an example of a paragraph from an essay I wrote about
<a href="unions.html">labor unions</a>.  As written,
it tends to offend people who like unions.
<blockquote>
  People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic
  union organizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking
  now?  The best they can do is fall back on the default explanation
  of people living in fallen civilizations. Our ancestors were
  giants.  The workers of the early twentieth century must have had
  a moral courage that's lacking today.
</blockquote>
Now here's the same paragraph rewritten to please instead of
offending them:
<blockquote>
  Early union organizers made heroic sacrifices to improve conditions
  for workers.  But though
  labor unions are shrinking now, it's not because present union
  leaders are any less courageous.  An employer couldn't get away
  with hiring thugs to beat up union leaders today, but if they
  did, I see no reason to believe today's union leaders would shrink
  from the challenge.  So I think it would be a mistake to attribute
  the decline of unions to some kind of decline in the people who
  run them.  Early union leaders were heroic, certainly, but we
  should not suppose that if unions have declined, it's because
  present union leaders are somehow inferior.  The cause must be
  external.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
It makes the same point: that it can't have been the personal
qualities of early union organizers that made unions successful,
but must have been some external factor, or otherwise present-day
union leaders would have to be inferior people.  But written this
way it seems like a defense of present-day union organizers rather
than an attack on early ones.  That makes it more persuasive to
people who like unions, because it seems sympathetic to their cause.<br><br>I believe everything I wrote in the second version.  Early union
leaders did make heroic sacrifices.   And
present union leaders probably would rise to the occasion if
necessary.  People tend to; I'm skeptical about the idea of "the
greatest generation." 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>If I believe everything I said in the second version, why didn't I
write it that way?  Why offend people needlessly?<br><br>Because I'd rather offend people than pander to them, 
and if you write about controversial topics you have to choose one or the other.  The degree of
courage of past or present union leaders is beside the point; all
that matters for the argument is that they're the same.
But if you want to please
people who are mistaken, you can't simply tell the truth.  You're
always going to have to add some sort of padding to protect their
misconceptions from bumping against reality.<br><br>Most writers do.  Most writers write to persuade, if only out of
habit or politeness.  But I don't write to persuade; I write to
figure out.  I write to persuade a hypothetical perfectly unbiased
reader.<br><br>Since the custom is to write to persuade the actual reader, someone
who doesn't will seem arrogant.  In fact, worse than arrogant: since
readers are used to essays that try to please someone, an essay
that displeases one side in a dispute reads as an attempt to pander
to the other.  To a lot of pro-union readers, the first paragraph
sounds like the sort of thing a right-wing radio talk show host
would say to stir up his followers.  But it's not.  Something that
curtly contradicts one's beliefs can be hard to distinguish from a
partisan attack on them, but though they can end up in the same
place they come from different sources.<br><br>Would it be so bad to add a few extra words, to make people feel
better?  Maybe not.  Maybe I'm excessively attached to conciseness.
I write <a href="power.html">code</a> the same way I write essays, 
making pass after pass
looking for anything I can cut.  But I have a legitimate reason for
doing this.  You don't know what the ideas are until you get them
down to the fewest words.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The danger of the second paragraph
is not merely that it's longer.  It's that you start to lie to
yourself.  The ideas start to get mixed together with the spin
you've added to get them past the readers' misconceptions.<br><br>I think the goal of an essay should be to discover 
<a href="essay.html">surprising</a> things.  That's my goal, at least.
And most surprising means most different from what people currently
believe.  So writing to persuade and writing to discover are
diametrically opposed.  The more your conclusions disagree with
readers' present beliefs, the more effort you'll have to expend on
selling your ideas rather than having them.  As you accelerate,
this drag increases, till eventually you reach a point where 100%
of your energy is devoted to overcoming it and you can't go any
faster.<br><br>It's hard enough to overcome one's own misconceptions without having
to think about how to get the resulting ideas past other people's.
I worry that if I wrote to persuade, I'd start to shy away unconsciously
from ideas I knew would be hard to sell.  When I notice something
surprising, it's usually very faint at first.  There's nothing more
than a slight stirring of discomfort.  I don't want anything to get
in the way of noticing it consciously.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I had a strange feeling of being back in high school writing
this.  To get a good grade you had to both write the sort of pious
crap you were expected to, but also seem to be writing with conviction.
The solution was a kind of method acting.  It was revoltingly
familiar to slip back into it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Exercise for the reader:
rephrase that thought to please the same people the first version
would offend.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Come to think of it, there is one way in which I deliberately
pander to readers, because it doesn't change the number of words:
I switch person.  This flattering distinction seems so natural to
the average reader that they probably don't notice even when I
switch in mid-sentence, though you tend to notice when it's done
as conspicuously as this.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston and Robert Morris

<p>
October 2009<br><br><i>(This  essay is derived from a talk at the 2009 Startup School.)</i><br><br>I wasn't sure what to talk about at Startup School, so I decided
to ask the founders of the startups we'd funded.  What hadn't I
written about yet?<br><br>I'm in the unusual position of being able to test the essays I write
about startups.  I hope the ones on other topics are right, but I
have no way to test them.  The ones on startups get tested by about
70 people every 6 months.<br><br>So I sent all the founders an email asking what surprised them about
starting a startup.  This amounts to asking what I got wrong, because
if I'd explained things well enough, nothing should have surprised
them.<br><br>I'm proud to report I got one response saying:
</p><blockquote>
    What surprised me the most is that everything was actually
    fairly predictable!
</blockquote>
The bad news is that I got over 100 other responses listing the
surprises they encountered.<br><br>There were very clear patterns in the responses; it was remarkable
how often several people had been surprised by exactly the same
thing.  These were the biggest:<br><br>
<b>1. Be Careful with Cofounders</b><br><br>This was the surprise mentioned by the most founders.  There were
two types of responses: that you have to be careful who you pick
as a cofounder, and that you have to work hard to maintain your
relationship.<br><br>What people wished they'd paid more attention to when choosing
cofounders was character and commitment, not ability.  This was
particularly true with startups that failed.  The lesson: don't
pick cofounders who will flake.<br><br>Here's a typical reponse:
<blockquote>
    You haven't seen someone's true colors unless you've worked
    with them on a startup.
</blockquote>
The reason character is so important is that it's tested more
severely than in most other situations.  One founder said explicitly
that the relationship between founders was more important than
ability:
<blockquote>
    I would rather cofound a startup with a friend than a stranger
    with higher output.  Startups are so hard and emotional that
    the bonds and emotional and social support that come with
    friendship outweigh the extra output lost.
</blockquote>
We learned this lesson a long time ago.  If you look at the YC
application, there are more questions about the commitment and
relationship of the founders than their ability.<br><br>Founders of successful startups talked less about choosing cofounders
and more about how hard they worked to maintain their relationship.
<blockquote>
    One thing that surprised me is how the relationship of startup
    founders goes from a friendship to a marriage.  My relationship
    with my cofounder went from just being friends to seeing each
    other all the time, fretting over the finances and cleaning up
    shit. And the startup was our baby.  I summed it up once like
    this: "It's like we're married, but we're not fucking."
</blockquote>
Several people used that word "married."  It's a far more intense
relationship than you usually see between coworkers—partly because
the stresses are so much greater, and partly because at first the
founders are the whole company.  So this relationship has to be
built of top quality materials and carefully maintained.  It's the
basis of everything.<br><br>
<b>2. Startups Take Over Your Life</b><br><br>Just as the relationship between cofounders is more intense than
it usually is between coworkers, so is the relationship between the
founders and the company.  Running a startup is not like having a
job or being a student, because it never stops.  This is so foreign
to most people's experience that they don't get it till it happens.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
<blockquote>
    I didn't realize I would spend almost every waking moment either
    working or thinking about our startup.  You enter a whole
    different way of life when it's your company vs. working for
    someone else's company.
</blockquote>
It's exacerbated by the fast pace of startups, which makes it seem
like time slows down:
<blockquote>
    I think the thing that's been most surprising to me is how one's
    perspective on time shifts. Working on our startup, I remember
    time seeming to stretch out, so that a month was a huge interval.
</blockquote>
In the best case, total immersion can be exciting:
<blockquote>
    It's surprising how much you become consumed by your startup,
    in that you think about it day and night, but never once does
    it feel like "work."
</blockquote>
Though I have to say, that quote is from someone we funded this
summer.  In a couple years he may not sound so chipper.<br><br>
<b>3. It's an Emotional Roller-coaster</b><br><br>This was another one lots of people were surprised about.  The ups
and downs were more extreme than they were prepared for.<br><br>In a startup, things seem great one moment and hopeless the next.
And by next, I mean a couple hours later.
<blockquote>
    The emotional ups and downs were the biggest surprise for me.
    One day, we'd think of ourselves as the next Google and dream
    of buying islands; the next, we'd be pondering how to let our
    loved ones know of our utter failure; and on and on.
</blockquote>
The hard part, obviously, is the lows.  For a lot of founders that
was the big surprise:
<blockquote>
    How hard it is to keep everyone motivated during rough days or
    weeks, i.e. how low the lows can be.
</blockquote>
After a while, if you don't have significant success to cheer you
up, it wears you out:
<blockquote>
    Your most basic advice to founders is "just don't die," but the
    energy to keep a company going in lieu of unburdening success
    isn't free; it is siphoned from the founders themselves.
</blockquote>
There's a limit to how much you can take.  If you get to the point
where you can't keep working anymore, it's not the end of the world.
Plenty of famous founders have had some failures along the way.<br><br>
<b>4. It Can Be Fun</b><br><br>The good news is, the highs are also very high.  Several founders
said what surprised them most about doing a startup was how fun it
was:
<blockquote>
    I think you've left out just how fun it is to do a startup. I
    am more fulfilled in my work than pretty much any of my friends
    who did not start companies.
</blockquote>
What they like most is the freedom:
<blockquote>
    I'm surprised by how much better it feels to be working on
    something that is challenging and creative, something I believe
    in, as opposed to the hired-gun stuff I was doing before.  I
    knew it would feel better; what's surprising is how much better.
</blockquote>
Frankly, though, if I've misled people here, I'm not eager to fix
that.  I'd rather have everyone think starting a startup is grim
and hard than have founders go into it expecting it to be fun, and
a few months later saying "This is supposed to be <i>fun</i>? Are you
kidding?"<br><br>The truth is, it wouldn't be fun for most people.  A lot of what
we try to do in the application process is to weed out the people
who wouldn't like it, both for our sake and theirs.<br><br>The best way to put it might be that starting a startup is fun the
way a survivalist training course would be fun, if you're into that
sort of thing.  Which is to say, not at all, if you're not.<br><br>
<b>5. Persistence Is the Key</b><br><br>A lot of founders were surprised how important persistence was in
startups. It was both a negative and a positive surprise: they were
surprised both by the degree of persistence required
<blockquote>
    Everyone said how determined and resilient you must be, but
    going through it made me realize that the determination required
    was still understated.
</blockquote>
and also by the degree to which persistence alone was able to
dissolve obstacles:
<blockquote>
    If you are persistent, even problems that seem out of your
    control (i.e. immigration) seem to work themselves out.
</blockquote>
Several founders mentioned specifically how much more important
persistence was than intelligence.
<blockquote>
    I've been surprised again and again by just how much more
    important persistence is than raw intelligence.
</blockquote>
This applies not just to intelligence but to ability in general,
and that's why so many people said character was more important in
choosing cofounders.<br><br>
<b>6. Think Long-Term</b><br><br>You need persistence because everything takes longer than you expect.
A lot of people were surprised by that.
<blockquote>
    I'm continually surprised by how long everything can take.
    Assuming your product doesn't experience the explosive growth
    that very few products do, everything from development to
    dealmaking (especially dealmaking) seems to take 2-3x longer
    than I always imagine.
</blockquote>
One reason founders are surprised is that because they work fast,
they expect everyone else to.   There's a shocking amount of shear
stress at every point where a startup touches a more bureaucratic
organization, like a big company or a VC fund.  That's why fundraising
and the enterprise market kill and maim so many startups.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>But I think the reason most founders are surprised by how long it
takes is that they're overconfident.  They think they're going to
be an instant success, like YouTube or Facebook.  You tell them
only 1 out of 100 successful startups has a trajectory like that,
and they all think "we're going to be that 1."<br><br>Maybe they'll listen to one of the more successful founders:
<blockquote>
    The top thing I didn't understand before going into it is that
    persistence is the name of the game. For the vast majority of
    startups that become successful, it's going to be a <i>really</i>
    long journey, at least 3 years and probably 5+.
</blockquote>
There is a positive side to thinking longer-term.  It's not just
that you have to resign yourself to everything taking longer than
it should.  If you work patiently it's less stressful, and you can
do better work:
<blockquote>
    Because we're relaxed, it's so much easier to have fun doing
    what we do. Gone is the awkward nervous energy fueled by the
    desperate need to not fail guiding our actions. We can concentrate
    on doing what's best for our company, product, employees and
    customers.
</blockquote>
That's why things get so much better when you hit ramen profitability.
You can shift into a different mode of working.<br><br><b>7. Lots of Little Things</b><br><br>We often emphasize how rarely startups win simply because they hit
on some magic idea.  I think founders have now gotten that into
their heads.  But a lot were surprised to find this also applies
within startups.  You have to do lots of different things:
<blockquote>
    It's much more of a grind than glamorous. A timeslice selected
    at random would more likely find me tracking down a weird DLL
    loading bug on Swedish Windows, or tracking down a bug in the
    financial model Excel spreadsheet the night before a board
    meeting, rather than having brilliant flashes of strategic
    insight.
</blockquote>
Most hacker-founders would like to spend all their time programming.
You won't get to, unless you fail.  Which can be transformed into:
If you spend all your time programming, you will fail.<br><br>The principle extends even into programming.  There is rarely a
single brilliant hack that ensures success:
<blockquote>
    I learnt never to bet on any one feature or deal or anything
    to bring you success. It is never a single thing.  Everything
    is just incremental and you just have to keep doing lots of
    those things until you strike something.
</blockquote>
Even in the rare cases where a clever hack makes your fortune, you
probably won't know till later:
<blockquote>
    There is no such thing as a killer feature. Or at least you
    won't know what it is.
</blockquote>
So the best strategy is to try lots of different things.  The reason
not to put all your eggs in one basket is not the usual one,
which applies even when you know which basket is best.  In a startup
you don't even know that.<br><br>
<b>8. Start with Something Minimal</b><br><br>Lots of founders mentioned how important it was to launch with the
simplest possible thing.  By this point everyone knows you should
release fast and iterate.  It's practically a mantra at YC.  But
even so a lot of people seem to have been burned by not doing it:
<blockquote>
    Build the absolute smallest thing that can be considered a
    complete application and ship it.
</blockquote>
Why do people take too long on the first version?  Pride, mostly.
They hate to release something that could be better.  They worry
what people will say about them.  But you have to overcome this:
<blockquote>
    Doing something "simple" at first glance does not mean you
    aren't doing something meaningful, defensible, or valuable.
</blockquote>
Don't worry what people will say.  If your first version is so
impressive that trolls don't make fun of it, you waited too long
to launch.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>One founder said this should be your approach to all programming,
not just startups, and I tend to agree.
<blockquote>
    Now, when coding, I try to think "How can I write this such
    that if people saw my code, they'd be amazed at how little there
    is and how little it does?"
</blockquote>
Over-engineering is poison.  It's not like doing extra work for
extra credit.  It's more like telling a lie that you then have to
remember so you don't contradict it.<br><br>
<b>9. Engage Users</b><br><br>Product development is a conversation with the user that doesn't
really start till you launch.  Before you launch, you're like a
police artist before he's shown the first version of his sketch to
the witness.<br><br>It's so important to launch fast that it may be better to think of
your initial version not as a product, but as a trick for getting
users to start talking to you.
<blockquote>
    I learned to think about the initial stages of a startup as a
    giant experiment. All products should be considered experiments,
    and those that have a market show promising results extremely
    quickly.
</blockquote>
Once you start talking to users, I guarantee you'll be surprised
by what they tell you.
<blockquote>
    When you let customers tell you what they're after, they will
    often reveal amazing details about what they find valuable as
    well what they're willing to pay for.
</blockquote>
The surprise is generally positive as well as negative. They won't
like what you've built, but there will be other things they would
like that would be trivially easy to implement.  It's not till you
start the conversation by launching the wrong thing that they can
express (or perhaps even realize) what they're looking for.<br><br>
<b>10. Change Your Idea</b><br><br>To benefit from engaging with users you have to be willing to change
your idea.  We've always encouraged founders to see a startup idea
as a hypothesis rather than a blueprint.  And yet they're still
surprised how well it works to change the idea.
<blockquote>
    Normally if you complain about something being hard, the general
    advice is to work harder.  With a startup, I think you should
    find a problem that's easy for you to solve.  Optimizing in
    solution-space is familiar and straightforward, but you can
    make enormous gains playing around in problem-space.
</blockquote>
Whereas mere determination, without flexibility, is a greedy algorithm
that may get you nothing more than a mediocre local maximum:
<blockquote>
    When someone is determined, there's still a danger that they'll
    follow a long, hard path that ultimately leads nowhere.
</blockquote>
You want to push forward, but at the same time twist and turn to
find the most promising path.  One founder put it very succinctly:
<blockquote>
    Fast iteration is the key to success.
</blockquote>
One reason this advice is so hard to follow is that people don't
realize how hard it is to judge startup ideas, particularly their
own.  Experienced founders learn to keep an open mind:
<blockquote>
    Now I don't laugh at ideas anymore, because I realized how
    terrible I was at knowing if they were good or not.
</blockquote>
You can never tell what will work.  You just have to do whatever
seems best at each point.  We do this with YC itself.  We still
don't know if it will work, but it seems like a decent hypothesis.<br><br>
<b>11. Don't Worry about Competitors</b><br><br>When you think you've got a great idea, it's sort of like having a
guilty conscience about something.  All someone has to do is look
at you funny, and you think "Oh my God, <i>they know.</i>"<br><br>These alarms are almost always false:
<blockquote>
    Companies that seemed like competitors and threats at first
    glance usually never were when you really looked at it. Even
    if they were operating in the same area, they had a different
    goal.
</blockquote>
One reason people overreact to competitors is that they overvalue
ideas.  If ideas really were the key, a competitor with the same
idea would be a real threat.  But it's usually execution that
matters:
<blockquote>
    All the scares induced by seeing a new competitor pop up are
    forgotten weeks later. It always comes down to your own product
    and approach to the market.
</blockquote>
This is generally true even if competitors get lots of attention.
<blockquote>
    Competitors riding on lots of good blogger perception aren't
    really the winners and can disappear from the map quickly.  You
    need consumers after all.
</blockquote>
Hype doesn't make satisfied users, at least not for something as
complicated as technology.<br><br><b>12. It's Hard to Get Users</b><br><br>A lot of founders complained about how hard it was to get users,
though.
<blockquote>
    I had no idea how much time and effort needed to go into attaining
    users.
</blockquote>
This is a complicated topic.  When you can't get users, it's hard
to say whether the problem is lack of exposure, or whether the
product's simply bad.  Even good products can be blocked by switching
or integration costs:
<blockquote>
    Getting people to use a new service is incredibly difficult.
    This is especially true for a service that other companies can
    use, because it requires their developers to do work. If you're
    small, they don't think it is urgent. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
The sharpest criticism of YC came from a founder who said we didn't
focus enough on customer acquisition:
<blockquote>
    YC preaches "make something people want" as an engineering task,
    a never ending stream of feature after feature until enough
    people are happy and the application takes off.  There's very
    little focus on the cost of customer acquisition.
</blockquote>
This may be true; this may be something we need to fix, especially
for applications like games.  If you make something where the
challenges are mostly technical, you can rely on word of mouth,
like Google did.  One founder was surprised by how well that worked
for him:
<blockquote>
    There is an irrational fear that no one will buy your product.
    But if you work hard and incrementally make it better, there
    is no need to worry.
</blockquote>
But with other types of startups you may win less by features and
more by deals and marketing.<br><br>
<b>13. Expect the Worst with Deals</b><br><br>Deals fall through.  That's a constant of the startup world.  Startups
are powerless, and good startup ideas generally seem wrong.  So
everyone is nervous about closing deals with you, and you have no
way to make them.<br><br>This is particularly true with investors:
<blockquote>
    In retrospect, it would have been much better if we had operated
    under the assumption that we would never get any additional
    outside investment.  That would have focused us on finding
    revenue streams early.
</blockquote>
My advice is generally pessimistic.  Assume you won't get money,
and if someone does offer you any, assume you'll never get any more.
<blockquote>
    If someone offers you money, take it. You say it a lot, but I
    think it needs even more emphasizing.  We had the opportunity
    to raise a lot more money than we did last year and I wish we
    had.
</blockquote>
Why do founders ignore me?  Mostly because they're optimistic by
nature.  The mistake is to be optimistic about things you can't
control. By all means be optimistic about your ability to make
something great.  But you're asking for trouble if you're optimistic
about big companies or investors.<br><br>
<b>14. Investors Are Clueless</b><br><br>A lot of founders mentioned how surprised they were by the cluelessness
of investors:
<blockquote>
    They don't even know about the stuff they've invested in.  I
    met some investors that had invested in a hardware device and
    when I asked them to demo the device they had difficulty switching
    it on.
</blockquote>
Angels are a bit better than VCs, because they usually have startup
experience themselves:
<blockquote>
    VC investors don't know half the time what they are talking
    about and are years behind in their thinking.  A few were great,
    but 95% of the investors we dealt with were unprofessional,
    didn't seem to be very good at business or have any kind of
    creative vision. Angels were generally much better to talk to.
</blockquote>
Why are founders surprised that VCs are clueless?  I think it's
because they seem so formidable.<br><br>The reason VCs seem formidable is that it's their profession to.
You get to be a VC by convincing asset managers to trust you with
hundreds of millions of dollars.  How do you do that?  You have to
seem confident, and you have to seem like you understand technology.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>15. You May Have to Play Games</b><br><br>Because investors are so bad at judging you, you have to work harder
than you should at selling yourself. One founder said the thing
that surprised him most was
<blockquote>
    The degree to which feigning certitude impressed investors.
</blockquote>
This is the thing that has surprised <i>me</i> most about YC founders'
experiences.  This summer we invited some of the alumni to talk to
the new startups about fundraising, and pretty much 100% of their
advice was about investor psychology.  I thought I was cynical about
VCs, but the founders were much more cynical.
<blockquote>
    A lot of what startup founders do is just posturing.  It works.
</blockquote>
VCs themselves have no idea of the extent to which the startups
they like are the ones that are best at selling themselves to VCs.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font>
It's exactly the same phenomenon we saw a step earlier.  VCs get
money by seeming confident to LPs, and founders get money by seeming
confident to VCs.<br><br>
<b>16. Luck Is a Big Factor</b><br><br>With two such random linkages in the path between startups and
money, it shouldn't be surprising that luck is a big factor in
deals.  And yet a lot of founders are surprised by it.
<blockquote>
    I didn't realize how much of a role luck plays and how much is
    outside of our control.
</blockquote>
If you think about famous startups, it's pretty clear how big a
role luck plays.  Where would Microsoft be if IBM insisted on an
exclusive license for DOS?<br><br>Why are founders fooled by this?  Business guys probably aren't,
but hackers are used to a world where skill is paramount, and you
get what you deserve.
<blockquote>
    When we started our startup, I had bought the hype of the startup
    founder dream: that this is a game of skill. It is, in some
    ways.  Having skill is valuable. So is being determined as all
    hell. But being lucky is the critical ingredient.
</blockquote>
Actually the best model would be to say that the outcome is the
<i>product</i> of skill, determination, and luck.  No matter how much
skill and determination you have, if you roll a zero for luck, the
outcome is zero.<br><br>These quotes about luck are not from founders whose startups failed.
Founders who fail quickly tend to blame themselves.  Founders who
succeed quickly don't usually realize how lucky they were.  It's
the ones in the middle who see how important luck is.<br><br>
<b>17. The Value of Community</b><br><br>A surprising number of founders said what surprised them most about
starting a startup was the value of community.  Some meant the
micro-community of YC founders:
<blockquote>
    The immense value of the peer group of YC companies, and facing
    similar obstacles at similar times.
</blockquote>
which shouldn't be that surprising, because that's why it's structured
that way.  Others were surprised at the value of the startup community
in the larger sense:
<blockquote>
    How advantageous it is to live in Silicon Valley, where you
    can't help but hear all the cutting-edge tech and startup news,
    and run into useful people constantly.
</blockquote>
The specific thing that surprised them most was the general spirit
of benevolence:
<blockquote>
    One of the most surprising things I saw was the willingness of
    people to help us. Even people who had nothing to gain went out
    of their way to help our startup succeed.
</blockquote>
and particularly how it extended all the way to the top:
<blockquote>
    The surprise for me was how accessible important and interesting
    people are. It's amazing how easily you can reach out to people
    and get immediate feedback.
</blockquote>
This is one of the reasons I like being part of this world.  Creating
wealth is not a zero-sum game, so you don't have to stab people in
the back to win.<br><br>
<b>18. You Get No Respect</b><br><br>There was one surprise founders mentioned that I'd forgotten about:
that outside the startup world, startup founders get no respect.
<blockquote>
    In social settings, I found that I got a lot more respect when
    I said, "I worked on Microsoft Office" instead of "I work at a
    small startup you've never heard of called x."
</blockquote>
Partly this is because the rest of the world just doesn't get
startups, and partly it's yet another consequence of the fact that
most good startup ideas seem bad:
<blockquote>
    If you pitch your idea to a random person, 95% of the time
    you'll find the person instinctively thinks the idea will be a
    flop and you're wasting your time (although they probably won't
    say this directly).
</blockquote>
Unfortunately this extends even to dating:
<blockquote>
    It surprised me that being a startup founder does not get you
    more admiration from women.
</blockquote>
I did know about that, but I'd forgotten.<br><br>
<b>19. Things Change as You Grow</b><br><br>The last big surprise founders mentioned is how much things changed
as they grew.  The biggest change was that you got to program even
less:
<blockquote>
    Your job description as technical founder/CEO is completely
    rewritten every 6-12 months. Less coding, more
    managing/planning/company building, hiring, cleaning up messes,
    and generally getting things in place for what needs to happen
    a few months from now.
</blockquote>
In particular, you now have to deal with employees, who often have
different motivations:
<blockquote>
    I knew the founder equation and had been focused on it since I
    knew I wanted to start a startup as a 19 year old.  The employee
    equation is quite different so it took me a while to get it
    down.
</blockquote>
Fortunately, it can become a lot less stressful once you reach
cruising altitude:
<blockquote>
    I'd say 75% of the stress is gone now from when we first started.
    Running a business is so much more enjoyable now.  We're more
    confident. We're more patient. We fight less. We sleep more.
</blockquote>
I wish I could say it was this way for every startup that succeeded,
but 75% is probably on the high side.<br><br>
<b>The Super-Pattern</b><br><br>There were a few other patterns, but these were the biggest.  One's
first thought when looking at them all is to ask if there's a
super-pattern, a pattern to the patterns.<br><br>I saw it immediately, and so did a YC founder I read the list to.
These are supposed to be the surprises, the things I didn't tell
people.  What do they all have in common?  They're all things I
tell people.  If I wrote a new essay with the same outline as this
that wasn't summarizing the founders' responses, everyone would say
I'd run out of ideas and was just repeating myself.<br><br>What is going on here?<br><br>When I look at the responses, the common theme is that
starting a startup was like I said, but way more so.  People just
don't seem to get how different it is till they do it.  Why?  The
key to that mystery is to ask, how different <i>from what?</i>  Once you
phrase it that way, the answer is obvious: from a job.  Everyone's
model of work is a job.  It's completely pervasive.  Even if you've
never had a job, your parents probably did, along with practically
every other adult you've met.<br><br>Unconsciously, everyone expects a startup to be like a job, and
that explains most of the surprises.  It explains why people are
surprised how carefully you have to choose cofounders and how hard
you have to work to maintain your relationship.  You don't have to
do that with coworkers.  It explains why the ups and downs are
surprisingly extreme.  In a job there is much more damping.  But
it also explains why the good times are surprisingly good: most
people can't imagine such freedom.  As you go down the list, almost
all the surprises are surprising in how much a startup differs from
a job.<br><br>You probably can't overcome anything so pervasive as the model of
work you grew up with.  So the best solution is to be consciously
aware of that.  As you go into a startup, you'll be thinking "everyone
says it's really extreme."  Your next thought will probably be "but
I can't believe it will be that bad."  If you want to avoid being
surprised, the next thought after that should be: "and the reason
I can't believe it will be that bad is that my model of work is a
job."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The best way for a startup to engage with slow-moving
organizations is to fork off separate processes to deal with them.
It's when they're on the critical path that they kill you—when
you depend on closing a deal to move forward.  It's worth taking
extreme measures to avoid that.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]

<p>
November 2009<br><br>I don't think Apple realizes how badly the App Store approval process
is broken.  Or rather, I don't think they realize how much it matters
that it's broken.<br><br>The way Apple runs the App Store has harmed their reputation with
programmers more than anything else they've ever done. 
Their reputation with programmers used to be great.
It used to be the most common complaint you heard
about Apple was that their fans admired them too uncritically.
The App Store has changed that.  Now a lot of programmers
have started to see Apple as evil.<br><br>How much of the goodwill Apple once had with programmers have they
lost over the App Store?  A third?  Half?  And that's just so far.
The App Store is an ongoing karma leak.<br><br></p><center>* * *</center><br><br>How did Apple get into this mess?  Their fundamental problem is
that they don't understand software.<br><br>They treat iPhone apps the way they treat the music they sell through
iTunes.  Apple is the channel; they own the user; if you want to
reach users, you do it on their terms. The record labels agreed,
reluctantly.  But this model doesn't work for software.  It doesn't
work for an intermediary to own the user.  The software business
learned that in the early 1980s, when companies like VisiCorp showed
that although the words "software" and "publisher" fit together,
the underlying concepts don't.  Software isn't like music or books.
It's too complicated for a third party to act as an intermediary
between developer and user.   And yet that's what Apple is trying
to be with the App Store: a software publisher.  And a particularly
overreaching one at that, with fussy tastes and a rigidly enforced
house style.<br><br>If software publishing didn't work in 1980, it works even less now
that software development has evolved from a small number of big
releases to a constant stream of small ones.  But Apple doesn't
understand that either.  Their model of product development derives
from hardware.  They work on something till they think it's finished,
then they release it.  You have to do that with hardware, but because
software is so easy to change, its design can benefit from evolution.
The standard way to develop applications now is to launch fast and
iterate.  Which means it's a disaster to have long, random delays
each time you release a new version.<br><br>Apparently Apple's attitude is that developers should be more careful
when they submit a new version to the App Store.  They would say
that.  But powerful as they are, they're not powerful enough to
turn back the evolution of technology.  Programmers don't use
launch-fast-and-iterate out of laziness.  They use it because it
yields the best results.  By obstructing that process, Apple is
making them do bad work, and programmers hate that as much as Apple
would.<br><br>How would Apple like it if when they discovered a serious bug in
OS&nbsp;X, instead of releasing a software update immediately, they had
to submit their code to an intermediary who sat on it for a month
and then rejected it because it contained an icon they didn't like?<br><br>By breaking software development, Apple gets the opposite of what
they intended: the version of an app currently available in the App
Store tends to be an old and buggy one.  One developer told me:
<blockquote>
  As a result of their process, the App Store is full of half-baked
  applications. I make a new version almost every day that I release
  to beta users. The version on the App Store feels old and crappy.
  I'm sure that a lot of developers feel this way: One emotion is
  "I'm not really proud about what's in the App Store", and it's
  combined with the emotion "Really, it's Apple's fault."
</blockquote>
Another wrote:
<blockquote>
  I believe that they think their approval process helps users by
  ensuring quality.  In reality, bugs like ours get through all the
  time and then it can take 4-8 weeks to get that bug fix approved,
  leaving users to think that iPhone apps sometimes just don't work.
  Worse for Apple, these apps work just fine on other platforms
  that have immediate approval processes.
</blockquote>
Actually I suppose Apple has a third misconception: that all the
complaints about App Store approvals are not a serious problem.
They must hear developers complaining.  But partners and suppliers
are always complaining.  It would be a bad sign if they weren't;
it would mean you were being too easy on them.  Meanwhile the iPhone
is selling better than ever.  So why do they need to fix anything?<br><br>They get away with maltreating developers, in the short term, because
they make such great hardware.  I just bought a new 27" iMac a
couple days ago.  It's fabulous.  The screen's too shiny, and the
disk is surprisingly loud, but it's so beautiful that you can't
make yourself care.<br><br>So I bought it, but I bought it, for the first time, with misgivings.
I felt the way I'd feel buying something made in a country with a
bad human rights record.  That was new.  In the past when I bought
things from Apple it was an unalloyed pleasure.  Oh boy!  They make
such great stuff.  This time it felt like a Faustian bargain.  They
make such great stuff, but they're such assholes.  Do I really want
to support this company?<br><br><center>* * *</center><br><br>Should Apple care what people like me think?  What difference does
it make if they alienate a small minority of their users?<br><br>There are a couple reasons they should care.  One is that these
users are the people they want as employees.  If your company seems
evil, the best programmers won't work for you.  That hurt Microsoft
a lot starting in the 90s.  Programmers started to feel sheepish
about working there.  It seemed like selling out.  When people from
Microsoft were talking to other programmers and they mentioned where
they worked, there were a lot of self-deprecating jokes about having
gone over to the dark side.  But the real problem for Microsoft
wasn't the embarrassment of the people they hired.  It was the
people they never got.  And you know who got them?  Google and
Apple.  If Microsoft was the Empire, they were the Rebel Alliance.
And it's largely because they got more of the best people that
Google and Apple are doing so much better than Microsoft today.<br><br>Why are programmers so fussy about their employers' morals?  Partly
because they can afford to be.  The best programmers can work
wherever they want.  They don't have to work for a company they
have qualms about.<br><br>But the other reason programmers are fussy, I think, is that evil
begets stupidity.  An organization that wins by exercising power
starts to lose the ability to win by doing better work.  And it's
not fun for a smart person to work in a place where the best ideas
aren't the ones that win.  I think the reason Google embraced "Don't
be evil" so eagerly was not so much to impress the outside world
as to inoculate themselves against arrogance.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>That has worked for Google so far.  They've become more
bureaucratic, but otherwise they seem to have held true to their
original principles. With Apple that seems less the case.  When you
look at the famous 
<a href="http://www.uriahcarpenter.info/1984.html">1984 ad</a> 
now, it's easier to imagine Apple as the
dictator on the screen than the woman with the hammer.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
In fact, if you read the dictator's speech it sounds uncannily like a
prophecy of the App Store.
<blockquote>
  We have triumphed over the unprincipled dissemination of facts.<br><br>We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of
  pure ideology, where each worker may bloom secure from the pests
  of contradictory and confusing truths.
</blockquote>
The other reason Apple should care what programmers think of them
is that when you sell a platform, developers make or break you.  If
anyone should know this, Apple should.  VisiCalc made the Apple II.<br><br>And programmers build applications for the platforms they use.  Most
applications—most startups, probably—grow out of personal projects.
Apple itself did.  Apple made microcomputers because that's what
Steve Wozniak wanted for himself.  He couldn't have afforded a
minicomputer. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
 Microsoft likewise started out making interpreters
for little microcomputers because
Bill Gates and Paul Allen were interested in using them.  It's a
rare startup that doesn't build something the founders use.<br><br>The main reason there are so many iPhone apps is that so many programmers
have iPhones.  They may know, because they read it in an article,
that Blackberry has such and such market share.  But in practice
it's as if RIM didn't exist. If they're going to build something,
they want to be able to use it themselves, and that means building
an iPhone app.<br><br>So programmers continue to develop iPhone apps, even though Apple
continues to maltreat them.  They're like someone stuck in an abusive
relationship.  They're so attracted to the iPhone that they can't
leave.  But they're looking for a way out.  One wrote:
<blockquote>
  While I did enjoy developing for the iPhone, the control they
  place on the App Store does not give me the drive to develop
  applications as I would like. In fact I don't intend to make any
  more iPhone applications unless absolutely necessary.

</blockquote>
Can anything break this cycle?  No device I've seen so far could.
Palm and RIM haven't a hope.  The only credible contender is Android.
But Android is an orphan; Google doesn't really care about it, not
the way Apple cares about the iPhone.  Apple cares about the iPhone
the way Google cares about search.<br><br><center>* * *</center><br><br>Is the future of handheld devices one locked down by Apple?  It's
a worrying prospect.  It would be a bummer to have another grim
monoculture like we had in the 1990s.  In 1995, writing software
for end users was effectively identical with writing Windows
applications.  Our horror at that prospect was the single biggest
thing that drove us to start building <a href="road.html">web apps</a>.<br><br>At least we know now what it would take to break Apple's lock.
You'd have to get iPhones out of programmers' hands.  If programmers
used some other device for mobile web access, they'd start to develop
apps for that instead.<br><br>How could you make a device programmers liked better than the iPhone?
It's unlikely you could make something better designed.  Apple
leaves no room there.  So this alternative device probably couldn't
win on general appeal.  It would have to win by virtue of some
appeal it had to programmers specifically.<br><br>One way to appeal to programmers is with software.  If you
could think of an application programmers had to have, but that
would be impossible in the circumscribed world of the iPhone, 
you could presumably get them to switch.<br><br>That would definitely happen if programmers started to use handhelds
as development machines—if handhelds displaced laptops the
way laptops displaced desktops.  You need more control of a development
machine than Apple will let you have over an iPhone.<br><br>Could anyone make a device that you'd carry around in your pocket
like a phone, and yet would also work as a development machine?
It's hard to imagine what it would look like.  But I've learned
never to say never about technology.  A phone-sized device that
would work as a development machine is no more miraculous by present
standards than the iPhone itself would have seemed by the standards
of 1995.<br><br>My current development machine is a MacBook Air, which I use with
an external monitor and keyboard in my office, and by itself when
traveling.  If there was a version half the size I'd prefer it.
That still wouldn't be small enough to carry around everywhere like
a phone, but we're within a factor of 4 or so.  Surely that gap is
bridgeable.  In fact, let's make it an

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
April 2010<br><br>The best way to come up with startup ideas is to ask yourself the
question: what do you wish someone would make for you?<br><br>There are two types of startup ideas: those that grow organically
out of your own life, and those that you decide, from afar, are
going to be necessary to some class of users other than you.  Apple
was the first type.  Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a
computer.  Unlike most people who wanted computers, he could design
one, so he did.  And since lots of other people wanted the same
thing, Apple was able to sell enough of them to get the company
rolling.  They still rely on this principle today, incidentally.
The iPhone is the phone Steve Jobs wants.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Our own startup, Viaweb, was of the second type.  We made software
for building online stores.  We didn't need this software ourselves.
We weren't direct marketers.  We didn't even know when we started
that our users were called "direct marketers."  But we were
comparatively old when we started the company (I was 30 and Robert
Morris was 29), so we'd seen enough to know users would need this
type of software.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>There is no sharp line between the two types of ideas, but
the most successful startups seem to be closer to the Apple type
than the Viaweb type.  When he was writing that first Basic interpreter
for the Altair, Bill Gates was writing something he would use, as
were Larry and Sergey when they wrote the first versions of Google.<br><br>Organic ideas are generally preferable to the made up kind, but
particularly so when the founders are young.  It takes experience
to predict what other people will want.  The worst ideas we see at
Y Combinator are from young founders making things they think other
people will want.<br><br>So if you want to start a startup and don't know yet what you're
going to do, I'd encourage you to focus initially on organic ideas.
What's missing or broken in your daily life?  Sometimes if you just
ask that question you'll get immediate answers.  It must have seemed
obviously broken to Bill Gates that you could only program the
Altair in machine language.<br><br>You may need to stand outside yourself a bit to see brokenness,
because you tend to get used to it and take it for granted.  You
can be sure it's there, though.  There are always great ideas sitting
right under our noses.  In 2004 it was ridiculous that Harvard
undergrads were still using a Facebook printed on paper.  Surely
that sort of thing should have been online.<br><br>There are ideas that obvious lying around now.  The reason you're
overlooking them is the same reason you'd have overlooked the idea
of building Facebook in 2004: organic startup ideas usually don't
seem like startup ideas at first.  We know now that Facebook was
very successful, but put yourself back in 2004.  Putting undergraduates'
profiles online wouldn't have seemed like much of a startup idea.
And in fact, it wasn't initially a startup idea.  When Mark spoke
at a YC dinner this winter he said he wasn't trying to start a
company when he wrote the first version of Facebook.  It was just
a project.  So was the Apple I when Woz first started working on
it.  He didn't think he was starting a company.  If these guys had
thought they were starting companies, they might have been tempted
to do something more "serious," and that would have been a mistake.<br><br>So if you want to come up with organic startup ideas, I'd encourage
you to focus more on the idea part and less on the startup part.
Just fix things that seem broken, regardless of whether it seems
like the problem is important enough to build a company on.  If you
keep pursuing such threads it would be hard not to end up making
something of value to a lot of people, and when you do, surprise,
you've got a company.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Don't be discouraged if what you produce initially is something
other people dismiss as a toy.  In fact, that's a good sign.
That's probably why everyone else has been overlooking the idea.  The first
microcomputers were dismissed as toys.  And the first planes, and
the first cars.  At this point, when someone comes to us with
something that users like but that we could envision forum trolls
dismissing as a toy, it makes us especially likely to invest.<br><br>While young founders are at a disadvantage when coming up with
made-up ideas, they're the best source of organic ones, because
they're at the forefront of technology.  They use the latest stuff.
They only just decided what to use, so why wouldn't they?  And
because they use the latest stuff, they're in a position to discover
valuable types of fixable brokenness first.<br><br>There's nothing more valuable than an unmet need that is just
becoming fixable.  If you find something broken that you can fix
for a lot of people, you've found a gold mine.  As with an actual
gold mine, you still have to work hard to get the gold out of it.
But at least you know where the seam is, and that's the hard part.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This suggests a way to predict areas where Apple will be weak:
things Steve Jobs doesn't use.  E.g. I doubt he is much into gaming.<br><br>
[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In retrospect, we should have <i>become</i> direct marketers.  If
I were doing Viaweb again, I'd open our own online store.  If we
had, we'd have understood users a lot better.  I'd encourage anyone
starting a startup to become one of its users, however unnatural it
seems.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Possible exception: It's hard to compete directly with open source software.
You can build things for programmers, but there has to be some part
you can charge for.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, and Jessica Livingston

I
now had to think about something I hadn't had to think about before:
how not to lose it.   I knew it was possible to go from rich to
poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich.  But while
I'd spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from
<a href="wealth.html">poor to rich</a>, 
I knew practically nothing about the paths from rich
to poor.  Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they
were.<br><br>So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost.  If you'd
asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I'd have said by
spending all their money.  That's how it happens in books and movies,
because that's the colorful way to do it.  But in fact the way most
fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through
bad investments.<br><br>It's hard to spend a fortune without noticing.  Someone with ordinary
tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of
thousands of dollars without thinking "wow, I'm spending a lot of
money."  Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a
million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an
eye.<br><br>In most people's minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms
that making investments doesn't.  Luxuries seem self-indulgent.
And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery,
you've already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads
to trouble.  Investing bypasses those alarms.  You're not spending
the money; you're just moving it from one asset to another.  Which
is why people trying to sell you expensive things say "it's an
investment."<br><br>The solution is to develop new alarms.  This can be a tricky business,
because while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are so
basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you
from making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes
fairly counterintuitive.<br><br>A few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with
time is much the same as with money.  The most dangerous way to
lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake
work.  When you spend time having fun, you know you're being
self-indulgent.  Alarms start to go off fairly quickly.  If I woke
up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I'd
feel like something was terribly wrong.  Just thinking about it
makes me wince.  I'd start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on
a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.<br><br>And yet I've definitely had days when I might as well have sat in
front of a TV all day — days at the end of which, if I asked myself
what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically,
nothing.  I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad
as I'd feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV.  If
I spent a whole day watching TV I'd feel like I was descending into
perdition.  But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get
nothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially,
like real work.  Dealing with email, for example.  You do it sitting
at a desk.  It's not fun.  So it must be work.<br><br>With time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to
protect you.  It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers,
and perhaps all pre-industrial societies.  So nature and nurture
combine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world has gotten
more complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors
that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more
virtuous types.  And the worst thing is, they're not even fun.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>
July 2010<br><br>I realized recently that what one thinks about in the shower in the
morning is more important than I'd thought.  I knew it was a good
time to have ideas.  Now I'd go further: now I'd say it's hard to
do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower.<br><br>Everyone who's worked on difficult problems is probably familiar
with the phenomenon of working hard to figure something out, failing,
and then suddenly seeing the answer a bit later while doing something
else. There's a kind of thinking you do without trying to.  I'm
increasingly convinced this type of thinking is not merely helpful
in solving hard problems, but necessary.  The tricky part is, you
can only control it indirectly.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>I think most people have one top idea in their mind at any given
time.  That's the idea their thoughts will drift toward when they're
allowed to drift freely.  And this idea will thus tend to get all
the benefit of that type of thinking, while others are starved of
it.  Which means it's a disaster to let the wrong idea become the
top one in your mind.<br><br>What made this clear to me was having an idea I didn't want as the
top one in my mind for two long stretches.<br><br>I'd noticed startups got way less done when they started raising
money, but it was not till we ourselves raised money that I understood
why.  The problem is not the actual time it takes to meet with
investors.  The problem is that once you start raising money, raising
money becomes the top idea in your mind.  That becomes what you
think about when you take a shower in the morning.  And that means
other questions aren't.<br><br>I'd hated raising money when I was running Viaweb, but I'd forgotten
why I hated it so much.  When we raised money for Y Combinator, I
remembered.  Money matters are particularly likely to become the
top idea in your mind.  The reason is that they have to be.  It's
hard to get money.  It's not the sort of thing that happens by
default.  It's not going to happen unless you let it become the
thing you think about in the shower.  And then you'll make little
progress on anything else you'd rather be working on.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>(I hear similar complaints from friends who are professors.  Professors
nowadays seem to have become professional fundraisers who do a
little research on the side.  It may be time to fix that.)<br><br>The reason this struck me so forcibly is that for most of the
preceding 10 years I'd been able to think about what I wanted.  So
the contrast when I couldn't was sharp.  But I don't think this
problem is unique to me, because just about every startup I've seen
grinds to a halt when they start raising money � or <a href="corpdev.html"><font color="#000099">talking
to acquirers</font></a>.<br><br>You can't directly control where your thoughts drift.  If you're
controlling them, they're not drifting.  But you can control them
indirectly, by controlling what situations you let yourself get
into.  That has been the lesson for me: be careful what you let
become critical to you.  Try to get yourself into situations where
the most urgent problems are ones you want to think about.<br><br>You don't have complete control, of course.  An emergency could
push other thoughts out of your head.  But barring emergencies you
have a good deal of indirect control over what becomes the top idea
in your mind.<br><br>I've found there are two types of thoughts especially worth
avoiding � thoughts like the Nile Perch in the way they push
out more interesting ideas.  One I've already mentioned: thoughts
about money. Getting money is almost by definition an attention
sink.
The other is disputes.  These too are engaging in the
wrong way: they have the same velcro-like shape as genuinely
interesting ideas, but without the substance.  So avoid disputes
if you want to get real work done.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Even Newton fell into this trap.  After publishing his theory of
colors in 1672 he found himself distracted by disputes for years,
finally concluding that the only solution was to stop publishing:
</p><blockquote>
  I see I have made myself a slave to Philosophy, but if I get free
  of Mr Linus's business I will resolutely bid adew to it eternally,
  excepting what I do for my privat satisfaction or leave to come
  out after me.  For I see a man must either resolve to put out
  nothing new or become a slave to defend it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
Linus and his students at Liege were among the more tenacious
critics.  Newton's biographer Westfall seems to feel he was
overreacting:
<blockquote>
  Recall that at the time he wrote, Newton's "slavery" consisted
  of five replies to Liege, totalling fourteen printed pages, over
  the course of a year.
</blockquote>
I'm more sympathetic to Newton. The problem was not the 14 pages,
but the pain of having this stupid controversy constantly reintroduced
as the top idea in a mind that wanted so eagerly to think about
other things.<br><br>Turning the other cheek turns out to have selfish advantages.
Someone who does you an injury hurts you twice: first by the injury
itself, and second by taking up your time afterward thinking about
it.  If you learn to ignore injuries you can at least avoid the
second half.  I've found I can to some extent avoid thinking about
nasty things people have done to me by telling myself: this doesn't
deserve space in my head.  I'm always delighted to find I've forgotten
the details of disputes, because that means I hadn't been thinking
about them.  My wife thinks I'm more forgiving than she is, but my
motives are purely selfish.<br><br>I suspect a lot of people aren't sure what's the top idea in their
mind at any given time.  I'm often mistaken about it.  I tend to
think it's the idea I'd want to be the top one, rather than the one
that is.  But it's easy to figure this out: just take a shower.
What topic do your thoughts keep returning to?  If it's not what
you want to be thinking about, you may want to change something.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
No doubt there are already names for this type of thinking, but
I call it "ambient thought."<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
This was made particularly clear in our case, because neither
of the funds we raised was difficult, and yet in both cases the
process dragged on for months.  Moving large amounts of money around
is never something people treat casually.  The attention required
increases with the amount—maybe not linearly, but definitely
monotonically.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Corollary: Avoid becoming an administrator, or your job will
consist of dealing with money and disputes.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]

that they're all more concentrated forms of less addictive predecessors.
Most if not all the things we describe as addictive are.  And the
scary thing is, the process that created them is accelerating.<br><br>We wouldn't want to stop it.  It's the same process that cures
diseases: technological progress.  Technological progress means
making things do more of what we want.  When the thing we want is
something we want to want, we consider technological progress good.
If some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, that
seems strictly better.  When progress concentrates something we
don't want to want — when it transforms opium into heroin — it seems
bad.  But it's the same process at work.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>No one doubts this process is accelerating, which means increasing
numbers of things we like will be transformed into things we like
too much.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>As far as I know there's no word for something we like too much.
The closest is the colloquial sense of "addictive." That usage has
become increasingly common during my lifetime. And it's clear why:
there are an increasing number of things we need it for. At the
extreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth. Food has been
transformed by a combination of factory farming and innovations in
food processing into something with way more immediate bang for the
buck, and you can see the results in any town in America. Checkers
and solitaire have been replaced by World of Warcraft and FarmVille.
TV has become much more engaging, and even so it <a href="convergence.html">can't compete</a> with Facebook.<br><br>The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago.   And unless
the forms of technological progress that produced these things are
subject to different laws than technological progress in general,
the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did
in the last 40.<br><br>The next 40 years will bring us some wonderful things.  I don't
mean to imply they're all to be avoided.  Alcohol is a dangerous
drug, but I'd rather live in a world with wine than one without.
Most people can coexist with alcohol; but you have to be careful.
More things we like will mean more things we have to be careful
about.<br><br>Most people won't, unfortunately.  Which means that as the world
becomes more addictive, the two senses in which one can live a
normal life will be driven ever further apart.  One sense of "normal"
is statistically normal: what everyone else does.  The other is the
sense we mean when we talk about the normal operating range of a
piece of machinery: what works best.<br><br>These two senses are already quite far apart.  Already someone
trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of
the US.  That phenomenon is only going to become more pronounced.
You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that if
people don't think you're weird, you're living badly.<br><br>Societies eventually develop antibodies to addictive new things.
I've seen that happen with cigarettes.  When cigarettes first
appeared, they spread the way an infectious disease spreads through
a previously isolated population.  Smoking rapidly became a
(statistically) normal thing.  There were ashtrays everywhere.  We
had ashtrays in our house when I was a kid, even though neither of
my parents smoked.  You had to for guests.<br><br>As knowledge spread about the dangers of smoking, customs changed.
In the last 20 years, smoking has been transformed from something
that seemed totally normal into a rather seedy habit: from something
movie stars did in publicity shots to something small huddles of
addicts do outside the doors of office buildings.  A lot of the
change was due to legislation, of course, but the legislation
couldn't have happened if customs hadn't already changed.<br><br>It took a while though—on the order of 100 years.  And unless the
rate at which social antibodies evolve can increase to match the
accelerating rate at which technological progress throws off new
addictions, we'll be increasingly unable to rely on customs to
protect us.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Unless we want to be canaries in the coal mine
of each new addiction—the people whose sad example becomes a
lesson to future generations—we'll have to figure out for ourselves
what to avoid and how.  It will actually become a reasonable strategy
(or a more reasonable strategy) to suspect 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet">everything new</a>.<br><br>In fact, even that won't be enough.  We'll have to worry not just
about new things, but also about existing things becoming more
addictive.  That's what bit me.  I've avoided most addictions, but
the Internet got me because it became addictive while I was using
it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Most people I know have problems with Internet addiction.  We're
all trying to figure out our own customs for getting free of it.
That's why I don't have an iPhone, for example; the last thing I
want is for the Internet to follow me out into the world.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
My latest trick is taking long hikes.  I used to think running was a
better form of exercise than hiking because it took less time.  Now
the slowness of hiking seems an advantage, because the longer I
spend on the trail, the longer I have to think without interruption.<br><br>Sounds pretty eccentric, doesn't it?  It always will when you're
trying to solve problems where there are no customs yet to guide
you.  Maybe I can't plead Occam's razor; maybe I'm simply eccentric.
But if I'm right about the acceleration of addictiveness, then this
kind of lonely squirming to avoid it will increasingly be the fate
of anyone who wants to get things done.  We'll increasingly be
defined by what we say no to.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Could you restrict technological progress to areas where you
wanted it?  Only in a limited way, without becoming a police state.
And even then your restrictions would have undesirable side effects.
"Good" and "bad" technological progress aren't sharply differentiated,
so you'd find you couldn't slow the latter without also slowing the
former.  And in any case, as Prohibition and the "war on drugs"
show, bans often do more harm than good.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Technology has always been accelerating.  By Paleolithic
standards, technology evolved at a blistering pace in the Neolithic
period.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Unless we mass produce social customs.  I suspect the recent
resurgence of evangelical Christianity in the US is partly a reaction
to drugs.  In desperation people reach for the sledgehammer; if
their kids won't listen to them, maybe they'll listen to God.  But
that solution has broader consequences than just getting kids to
say no to drugs.  You end up saying no to 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbXgsMxOPtI">science</a> as well.
<!-- "A rare look inside a bible belt classroom." --><br><br>I worry we may be heading for a future in which only a few people
plot their own itinerary through no-land, while everyone else books
a package tour.  Or worse still, has one booked for them by the
government.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
People commonly use the word "procrastination" to describe
what they do on the Internet.  It seems to me too mild to describe
what's happening as merely not-doing-work.  We don't call it
procrastination when someone gets drunk instead of working.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Several people have told me they like the iPad because it
lets them bring the Internet into situations where a laptop would
be too conspicuous.  In other words, it's a hip flask.  (This is
true of the iPhone too, of course, but this advantage isn't as
obvious because it reads as a phone, and everyone's used to those.)<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, and

<p>
August 2010<br><br>Two years ago I
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/googles.html#next">wrote</a> about what I called "<xa href="http://www.paulgraham.com/googles.html#next">a huge, unexploited
opportunity in startup funding:" the growing disconnect between
VCs, whose current business model requires them to invest large
amounts, and a large class of startups that need less than they
used to.  Increasingly, startups want a couple hundred thousand
dollars, not a couple million. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The opportunity is a lot less unexploited now.  Investors have
poured into this territory from both directions.  VCs are much more
likely to make angel-sized investments than they were a year ago.
And meanwhile the past year has seen a dramatic increase in a new
type of investor: the super-angel, who operates like an angel, but
using other people's money, like a VC.<br><br>Though a lot of investors are entering this territory, there is
still room for more.  The distribution of investors should mirror
the distribution of startups, which has the usual power law dropoff.
So there should be a lot more people investing tens or hundreds of
thousands than millions. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>In fact, it may be good for angels that there are more people doing
angel-sized deals, because if angel rounds become more legitimate,
then startups may start to opt for angel rounds even when they
could, if they wanted, raise series A rounds from VCs.  One reason
startups prefer series A rounds is that they're more prestigious.
But if angel investors become more active and better known, they'll
increasingly be able to compete with VCs in brand.<br><br>Of course, prestige isn't the main reason to prefer a series A
round.  A startup will probably get more attention from investors
in a series A round than an angel round.  So if a startup is choosing
between an angel round and an A round from a good VC fund, I usually
advise them to take the A round. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>But while series A rounds aren't going away, I think VCs should be
more worried about super-angels than vice versa.  Despite their
name, the super-angels are really mini VC funds, and they clearly
have existing VCs in their sights.<br><br>They would seem to have history on their side.  
The pattern here seems the same
one we see when startups and established companies enter a new
market.  Online video becomes possible, and YouTube plunges right
in, while existing media companies embrace it only half-willingly,
driven more by fear than hope, and aiming more to protect their
turf than to do great things for users.  Ditto for PayPal.  This
pattern is repeated over and over, and it's usually the invaders
who win. In this case the super-angels are the invaders.  Angel
rounds are their whole business, as online video was for YouTube.
Whereas VCs who make angel investments mostly do it as a way to
generate deal flow for series A rounds.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>On the other hand, startup investing is a very strange business.
Nearly all the returns are concentrated in a few big winners.  If
the super-angels merely fail to invest in (and to some extent
produce) the big winners, they'll be out of business, even if they
invest in all the others.<br><br><b>VCs</b><br><br>Why don't VCs start doing smaller series A rounds?  The sticking
point is board seats.  In a traditional series A round, the partner
whose deal it is takes a seat on the startup's board.  If we assume
the average startup runs for 6 years and a partner can bear to be
on 12 boards at once, then a VC fund can do 2 series A deals per
partner per year.<br><br>It has always seemed to me the solution is to take fewer board
seats.  You don't have to be on the board to help a startup.  Maybe
VCs feel they need the power that comes with board membership to
ensure their money isn't wasted.  But have they tested that theory?
Unless they've tried not taking board seats and found their returns
are lower, they're not bracketing the problem.<br><br>I'm not saying VCs don't help startups.  The good ones help them a
lot.  What I'm saying is that the kind of help that matters, you
may not have to be a board member to give.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>How will this all play out?  Some VCs will probably adapt, by doing
more, smaller deals.  I wouldn't be surprised if by streamlining
their selection process and taking fewer board seats, VC funds could
do 2 to 3 times as many series A rounds with no loss of quality.<br><br>But other VCs will make no more than superficial changes.  VCs are
conservative, and the threat to them isn't mortal.  The VC funds
that don't adapt won't be violently displaced.  They'll edge gradually
into a different business without realizing it.  They'll still do
what they will call series A rounds, but these will increasingly
be de facto series B rounds.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>In such rounds they won't get the 25 to 40% of the company they do
now.  You don't give up as much of the company in later rounds
unless something is seriously wrong.  Since the VCs who don't adapt
will be investing later, their returns from winners may be smaller.
But investing later should also mean they have fewer losers.  So
their ratio of risk to return may be the same or even better.
They'll just have become a different, more conservative, type of
investment.<br><br><b>Angels</b><br><br>In the big angel rounds that increasingly compete with series A
rounds, the investors won't take as much equity as VCs do now.  And
VCs who try to compete with angels by doing more, smaller deals
will probably find they have to take less equity to do it. Which
is good news for founders: they'll get to keep more of the company.<br><br>The deal terms of angel rounds will become less restrictive
too—not just less restrictive than series A terms, but less
restrictive than angel terms have traditionally been.<br><br>In the future, angel rounds will less often be for specific amounts
or have a lead investor.  In the old days, the standard m.o. for
startups was to find one angel to act as the lead investor.  You'd
negotiate a round size and valuation with the lead, who'd supply
some but not all of the money.  Then the startup and the lead would
cooperate to find the rest.<br><br>The future of angel rounds looks more like this: instead of a fixed
round size, startups will do a rolling close, where they take money
from investors one at a time till they feel they have enough.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
And though there's going to be one investor who gives them the first
check, and his or her help in recruiting other investors will
certainly be welcome, this initial investor will no longer be the
lead in the old sense of managing the round.  The startup will now
do that themselves.<br><br>There will continue to be lead investors in the sense of investors
who take the lead in <i>advising</i> a startup.  They may also make
the biggest investment.  But they won't always have to be the one
terms are negotiated with, or be the first money in, as they have
in the past.  Standardized paperwork will do away with the need to
negotiate anything except the valuation, and that will get easier
too.<br><br>If multiple investors have to share a valuation, it will be whatever
the startup can get from the first one to write a check, limited
by their guess at whether this will make later investors balk.  But
there may not have to be just one valuation.  Startups are increasingly
raising money on convertible notes, and convertible notes have not
valuations but at most valuation <i>caps</i>: caps on what the
effective valuation will be when the debt converts to equity (in a
later round, or upon acquisition if that happens first).  That's
an important difference because it means a startup could do multiple
notes at once with different caps.  This is now starting to happen,
and I predict it will become more common.<br><br><b>Sheep</b><br><br>The reason things are moving this way is that the old way sucked
for startups.  Leads could (and did) use a fixed size round as a
legitimate-seeming way of saying what all founders hate to hear:
I'll invest if other people will.  Most investors, unable to judge
startups for themselves, rely instead on the opinions of other
investors.  If everyone wants in, they want in too; if not, not.
Founders hate this because it's a recipe for deadlock, and delay
is the thing a startup can least afford.  Most investors know this
m.o. is lame, and few say openly that they're doing it.  But the
craftier ones achieve the same result by offering to lead rounds
of fixed size and supplying only part of the money.  If the startup
can't raise the rest, the lead is out too.  How could they go ahead
with the deal?  The startup would be underfunded!<br><br>In the future, investors will increasingly be unable to offer
investment subject to contingencies like other people investing.
Or rather, investors who do that will get last place in line.
Startups will go to them only to fill up rounds that are mostly
subscribed.  And since hot startups tend to have rounds that are
oversubscribed, being last in line means they'll probably miss the
hot deals.  Hot deals and successful startups are not identical,
but there is a significant correlation. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font>
So investors who won't invest unilaterally will have lower returns.<br><br>Investors will probably find they do better when deprived of this
crutch anyway.   Chasing hot deals doesn't make investors choose
better; it just makes them feel better about their choices.  I've
seen feeding frenzies both form and fall apart many times, and as
far as I can tell they're mostly random. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font>
If investors can
no longer rely on their herd instincts, they'll have to think more
about each startup before investing.  They may be surprised how
well this works.<br><br>Deadlock wasn't the only disadvantage of letting a lead investor
manage an angel round.  The investors would not infrequently collude
to push down the valuation.  And rounds took too long to close,
because however motivated the lead was to get the round closed, he
was not a tenth as motivated as the startup.<br><br>Increasingly, startups are taking charge of their own angel rounds.
Only a few do so far, but I think we can already declare the old
way dead, because those few are the best startups.  They're the
ones in a position to tell investors how the round is going to work.
And if the startups you want to invest in do things a certain way,
what difference does it make what the others do?<br><br><b>Traction</b><br><br>In fact, it may be slightly misleading to say that angel rounds
will increasingly take the place of series A rounds.  What's really
happening is that startup-controlled rounds are taking the place
of investor-controlled rounds.<br><br>This is an instance of a very important meta-trend, one that Y
Combinator itself has been based on from the beginning: founders
are becoming increasingly powerful relative to investors.  So if
you want to predict what the future of venture funding will be like,
just ask: how would founders like it to be?  One by one, all the
things founders dislike about raising money are going to get
eliminated. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>Using that heuristic, I'll predict a couple more things.  One is
that investors will increasingly be unable to wait for startups to
have "traction" before they put in significant money.  It's hard
to predict in advance which startups will succeed.  So most investors
prefer, if they can, to wait till the startup is already succeeding,
then jump in quickly with an offer.  Startups hate this as well,
partly because it tends to create deadlock, and partly because it
seems kind of slimy.  If you're a promising startup but don't yet
have significant growth, all the investors are your friends in
words, but few are in actions.  They all say they love you, but
they all wait to invest. Then when you start to see growth, they
claim they were your friend all along, and are aghast at the thought
you'd be so disloyal as to leave them out of your round.  If founders
become more powerful, they'll be able to make investors give them
more money upfront.<br><br>(The worst variant of this behavior is the tranched deal, where the
investor makes a small initial investment, with more to follow if
the startup does well.  In effect, this structure gives the investor
a free option on the next round, which they'll only take if it's
worse for the startup than they could get in the open market.
Tranched deals are an abuse.  They're increasingly rare, and they're
going to get rarer.) 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>Investors don't like trying to predict which startups will succeed,
but increasingly they'll have to.  Though the way that happens won't
necessarily be that the behavior of existing investors will change;
it may instead be that they'll be replaced by other investors with
different behavior—that investors who understand startups
well enough to take on the hard problem of predicting their trajectory
will tend to displace suits whose skills lie more in raising money
from LPs.<br><br><b>Speed</b><br><br>The other thing founders hate most about fundraising is how long
it takes.  So as founders become more powerful, rounds should start
to close faster.<br><br>Fundraising is still terribly distracting for startups. If you're
a founder in the middle of raising a round, the round is the <a href="top.html">top idea in your mind</a>, which means working on the
company isn't.  If a round takes 2 months to close, which is
reasonably fast by present standards, that means 2 months during
which the company is basically treading water.  That's the worst
thing a startup could do.<br><br>So if investors want to get the best deals, the way to do it will
be to close faster.   Investors don't need weeks to make up their
minds anyway.  We decide based on about 10 minutes of reading an
application plus 10 minutes of in person interview, and we only
regret about 10% of our decisions.  If we can decide in 20 minutes,
surely the next round of investors can decide in a couple days.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>There are a lot of institutionalized delays in startup funding: the
multi-week mating dance with investors; the distinction between
termsheets and deals; the fact that each series A has enormously
elaborate, custom paperwork.  Both founders and investors tend to
take these for granted.  It's the way things have always been.  But
ultimately the reason these delays exist is that they're to the
advantage of investors.  More time gives investors more information
about a startup's trajectory, and it also tends to make startups
more pliable in negotiations, since they're usually short of money.<br><br>These conventions weren't designed to drag out the funding process,
but that's why they're allowed to persist.  Slowness is to the
advantage of investors, who have in the past been the ones with the
most power.  But there is no need for rounds to take months or even
weeks to close, and once founders realize that, it's going to stop.
Not just in angel rounds, but in series A rounds too.  The future
is simple deals with standard terms, done quickly.<br><br>One minor abuse that will get corrected in the process is option
pools.  In a traditional series A round, before the VCs invest they
make the company set aside a block of stock for future hires—usually
between 10 and 30% of the company.  The point is to ensure this
dilution is borne by the existing shareholders.  The practice isn't
dishonest; founders know what's going on.  But it makes deals
unnecessarily complicated.  In effect the valuation is 2 numbers.
There's no need to keep doing this.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>The final thing founders want is to be able to sell some of
their own stock in later rounds.  This won't be a change, 
because the practice is now quite common.  A lot of investors
hated the idea, but the world hasn't exploded as a result,
so it will happen more, and more openly.<br><br><b>Surprise</b><br><br>I've talked here about a bunch of changes that will be forced on
investors as founders become more powerful.  Now the good news:
investors may actually make more money as a result.<br><br>A couple days ago an interviewer 
<a href="http://techcrunch.tv/watch?id=Q3amZtMTryrpiP80cbUtsV2ah92eZP2m">asked 
me</a> if founders having more
power would be better or worse for the world.  I was surprised,
because I'd never considered that question.  Better or worse, it's
happening.  But after a second's reflection, the answer seemed
obvious.  Founders understand their companies better than investors,
and it has to be better if the people with more knowledge have more
power.<br><br>One of the mistakes novice pilots make is overcontrolling the
aircraft: applying corrections too vigorously, so the aircraft
oscillates about the desired configuration instead of approaching
it asymptotically.  It seems probable that investors have till now
on average been overcontrolling their portfolio companies.  In a
lot of startups, the biggest source of stress for the founders is
not competitors but investors.  Certainly it was for us at Viaweb.
And this is not a new phenomenon: investors were James Watt's biggest
problem too.   If having less power prevents investors from
overcontrolling startups, it should be better not just for founders
but for investors too.<br><br>Investors may end up with less stock per startup, but startups will
probably do better with founders more in control, and there will
almost certainly be more of them.  Investors all compete with one
another for deals, but they aren't one another's main competitor.
Our main competitor is employers.  And so far that competitor is
crushing us.  Only a tiny fraction of people who could start a
startup do.  Nearly all customers choose the competing product, a
job.  Why?  Well, let's look at the product we're offering.  An
unbiased review would go something like this:
</xa></p><blockquote>
  Starting a startup gives you more freedom and the opportunity to
  make a lot more money than a job, but it's also hard work and at
  times very stressful.
</blockquote>
Much of the stress comes from dealing with investors.  If reforming
the investment process removed that stress, we'd make our product
much more attractive.  The kind of people who make good startup
founders don't mind dealing with technical problems—they enjoy
technical problems—but they hate the type of problems investors
cause.<br><br>Investors have no
idea that when they maltreat one startup, they're preventing 10
others from happening, but they are.  Indirectly, but they are.  So
when investors stop trying to squeeze a little more out of their
existing deals, they'll find they're net ahead, because so many
more new deals appear.<br><br>One of our axioms at Y Combinator is not to think of deal flow as
a zero-sum game.  Our main focus is to encourage more startups to happen,
not to win a larger share of the existing stream.  We've found this
principle very useful, and we think as it spreads outward it will
help later stage investors as well.<br><br>"Make something people want"
applies to us too.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
In this essay I'm talking mainly about software startups.
These points don't apply to types of startups that are still expensive
to start, e.g. in energy or biotech.<br><br>Even the cheap kinds of startups will generally raise large amounts
at some point, when they want to hire a lot of people.  What has
changed is how much they can get done before that.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
It's not the distribution of good startups that has a power
law dropoff, but the distribution of potentially good startups,
which is to say, good deals.  There are lots of potential winners,
from which a few actual winners emerge with superlinear certainty.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
As I was writing this, I asked some founders who'd taken
series A rounds from top VC funds whether it was worth it, and they
unanimously said yes.<br><br>The quality of investor is more important than the type of round,
though.  I'd take an angel round from good angels over a series A
from a mediocre VC.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Founders also worry that taking an angel investment from a
VC means they'll look bad if the VC declines to participate in the
next round.  The trend of VC angel investing is so new that it's
hard to say how justified this worry is.<br><br>Another danger, pointed out by Mitch Kapor, is that if VCs are only
doing angel deals to generate series A deal flow, then their
incentives aren't aligned with the founders'.  The founders want
the valuation of the next round to be high, and the VCs want it to
be low.  Again, hard to say yet how much of a problem this will be.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Josh Kopelman pointed out that another way to be on fewer
boards at once is to take board seats for shorter periods.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Google was in this respect as so many others the pattern for
the future.  It would be great for VCs if the similarity extended
to returns.  That's probably too much to hope for, but the returns
may be somewhat higher, as I explain later.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Doing a rolling close doesn't mean the company is always
raising money.  That would be a distraction.  The point of a rolling
close is to make fundraising take less time, not more.  With a
classic fixed sized round, you don't get any money till all the
investors agree, and that often creates a situation where they all
sit waiting for the others to act.  A rolling close usually prevents
this.<br><br><!-- [<a name="f8n"><font color=#000000>8</font></a>]
Jeff Clavier pointed out a tax disadvantage of convertible
notes: they don't start the long term capital gains clock.  So
perhaps the ultimate solution, after investors have been conditioned
to do simpler deals with multiple caps by convertible notes, is
eventually to do equity rounds that approach the same simplicity
and flexibility.
-->
[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
There are two (non-exclusive) causes of hot deals: the quality
of the company, and domino effects among investors.  The former is
obviously a better predictor of success.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Some of the randomness is concealed by the fact that investment
is a self fulfilling prophecy.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
The shift in power to founders is exaggerated now because
it's a seller's market.  On the next downtick it will seem like I
overstated the case.  But on the next uptick after that, founders
will seem more powerful than ever.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
More generally, it will become less common for the same
investor to invest in successive rounds, except when exercising an
option to maintain their percentage.  When the same investor invests
in successive rounds, it often means the startup isn't getting
market price.  They may not care; they may prefer to work with an
investor they already know; but as the investment market becomes
more efficient, it will become increasingly easy to get market price
if they want it.  Which in turn means the investment community will
tend to become more stratified.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
The two 10 minuteses have 3 weeks between them so founders
can get cheap plane tickets, but except for that they could be
adjacent.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
I'm not saying option pools themselves will go away.  They're
an administrative convenience.  What will go away is investors
requiring them.<br><br><br><br>

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
August 2010<br><br>When I went to work for Yahoo after they bought our startup in 1998,
it felt like the center of the world.  It was supposed to be the
next big thing.  It was supposed to be what Google turned out to
be.<br><br>What went wrong?  The problems that hosed Yahoo go back a long time,
practically to the beginning of the company.  They were already
very visible when I got there in 1998.  Yahoo had two problems
Google didn't: easy money, and ambivalence about being a technology
company.<br><br><b>Money</b><br><br>The first time I met Jerry Yang, we thought we were meeting for
different reasons.  He thought we were meeting so he could check
us out in person before buying us. I thought we were meeting so we
could show him our new technology, Revenue Loop.   It was a way of
sorting shopping search results.  Merchants bid a percentage of
sales for traffic, but the results were sorted not by the bid but
by the bid times the average amount a user would buy.  It was
like the algorithm Google uses now to sort ads, but this was in the
spring of 1998, before Google was founded.<br><br>Revenue Loop was the optimal sort for shopping search, in the sense
that it sorted in order of how much money Yahoo would make from
each link.  But it wasn't just optimal in that sense.  Ranking
search results by user behavior also makes search better.  Users
train the search: you can start out finding matches based on mere
textual similarity, and as users buy more stuff the search results
get better and better.<br><br>Jerry didn't seem to care.  I was confused.  I was showing him
technology that extracted the maximum value from search traffic,
and he didn't care?  I couldn't tell whether I was explaining it
badly, or he was just very poker faced.<br><br>I didn't realize the answer till later, after I went to work at
Yahoo.  It was neither of my guesses.  The reason Yahoo didn't care
about a technique that extracted the full value of traffic was that
advertisers were already overpaying for it.  If Yahoo merely extracted
the actual value, they'd have made less.<br><br>Hard as it is to believe now, the big money then was in banner ads.
Advertisers were willing to pay ridiculous amounts for banner ads.
So Yahoo's sales force had evolved to exploit this source of revenue.
Led by a large and terrifyingly formidable man called Anil Singh,
Yahoo's sales guys would fly out to Procter &amp; Gamble and come back
with million dollar orders for banner ad impressions.<br><br>The prices seemed cheap compared to print, which was what advertisers,
for lack of any other reference, compared them to.  But they were
expensive compared to what they were worth.  So these big, dumb
companies were a dangerous source of revenue to depend on.  But
there was another source even more dangerous: other Internet startups.<br><br>By 1998, Yahoo was the beneficiary of a de facto Ponzi scheme.
Investors were excited about the Internet.  One reason they were
excited was Yahoo's revenue growth.  So they invested in new Internet
startups.  The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to
get traffic.  Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and
further convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in.
When I realized this one day, sitting in my cubicle, I jumped up
like Archimedes in his bathtub, except instead of "Eureka!" I was
shouting "Sell!"<br><br>Both the Internet startups and the Procter &amp; Gambles were doing
brand advertising.  They didn't care about targeting.  They just
wanted lots of people to see their ads.  So traffic became the thing
to get at Yahoo.  It didn't matter what type.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>It wasn't just Yahoo.  All the search engines were doing it.  This
was why they were trying to get people to start calling them "portals"
instead of "search engines." Despite the actual meaning of the word
portal, what they meant by it was a site where users would find
what they wanted on the site itself, instead of just passing through
on their way to other destinations, as they did at a search engine.<br><br>I remember telling David Filo in late 1998 or early 1999 that Yahoo
should buy Google, because I and most of the other programmers in
the company were using it instead of Yahoo for search.  He told me
that it wasn't worth worrying about.  Search was only 6% of our
traffic, and we were growing at 10% a month.   It wasn't worth doing
better.<br><br>I didn't say "But search traffic is worth more than other traffic!"
I said "Oh, ok."  Because I didn't realize either how much search
traffic was worth.  I'm not sure even Larry and Sergey did then.
If they had, Google presumably wouldn't have expended any effort
on enterprise search.<br><br>If circumstances had been different, the people running Yahoo might
have realized sooner how important search was.  But they had the
most opaque obstacle in the world between them and the truth: money.
As long as customers were writing big checks for banner ads, it was
hard to take search seriously.  Google didn't have that to distract
them.<br><br><b>Hackers</b><br><br>But Yahoo also had another problem that made it hard to change
directions.  They'd been thrown off balance from the start by their
ambivalence about being a technology company.<br><br>One of the weirdest things about Yahoo when I went to work there
was the way they insisted on calling themselves a "media company."
If you walked around their offices, it seemed like a software
company.  The cubicles were full of programmers writing code, product
managers thinking about feature lists and ship dates, support people
(yes, there were actually support people) telling users to restart
their browsers, and so on, just like a software company.  So why
did they call themselves a media company?<br><br>One reason was the way they made money: by selling ads.  In 1995
it was hard to imagine a technology company making money that way.
Technology companies made money by selling their software to users.
Media companies sold ads.  So they must be a media company.<br><br>Another big factor was the fear of Microsoft.   If anyone at Yahoo
considered the idea that they should be a technology company, the
next thought would have been that Microsoft would crush them.<br><br>It's hard for anyone much younger than me to understand the fear
Microsoft still inspired in 1995.  Imagine a company with several
times the power Google has now, but way meaner.  It was perfectly
reasonable to be afraid of them.  Yahoo watched them crush the first
hot Internet company, Netscape.  It was reasonable to worry that
if they tried to be the next Netscape, they'd suffer the same fate.
How were they to know that Netscape would turn out to be Microsoft's
last victim?<br><br>It would have been a clever move to pretend to be a media company
to throw Microsoft off their scent.  But unfortunately Yahoo actually
tried to be one, sort of.  Project managers at Yahoo were called
"producers," for example, and the different parts of the company
were called "properties." But what Yahoo really needed to be was a
technology company, and by trying to be something else, they ended
up being something that was neither here nor there.  That's why
Yahoo as a company has never had a sharply defined identity.<br><br>The worst consequence of trying to be a media company was that they
didn't take programming seriously enough.  Microsoft (back in the
day), Google, and Facebook have all had hacker-centric cultures.
But Yahoo treated programming as a commodity.  At Yahoo, user-facing software
was controlled by product managers and designers.  The job of
programmers was just to take the work of the product managers and
designers the final step, by translating it into code.<br><br>One obvious result of this practice was that when Yahoo built things,
they often weren't very good. But that wasn't the worst problem.
The worst problem was that they hired bad programmers.<br><br>Microsoft (back in the day), Google, and Facebook have all been
obsessed with hiring the best programmers.  Yahoo wasn't.  They
preferred good programmers to bad ones, but they didn't have the
kind of single-minded, almost obnoxiously elitist focus on hiring
the smartest people that the big winners have had.  And when you
consider how much competition there was for programmers when they
were hiring, during the Bubble, it's not surprising that the quality
of their programmers was uneven.<br><br>In technology, once you have bad programmers, you're doomed.  I
can't think of an instance where a company has sunk into technical
mediocrity and recovered. Good programmers want to work with other
good programmers.  So once the quality of programmers at your company
starts to drop, you enter a death spiral from which there is no
recovery.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>At Yahoo this death spiral started early.  If there was ever a time when
Yahoo was a Google-style talent magnet, it was over by the time I
got there in 1998.<br><br>The company felt prematurely old.  Most technology companies
eventually get taken over by suits and middle managers.  At Yahoo
it felt as if they'd deliberately accelerated this process.  They
didn't want to be a bunch of hackers.  They wanted to be suits.  A
media company should be run by suits.<br><br>The first time I visited Google, they had about 500 people, the
same number Yahoo had when I went to work there.  But boy did things
seem different.  It was still very much a hacker-centric culture.
I remember talking to some programmers in the cafeteria about the
problem of gaming search results (now known as SEO), and they asked
"what should we do?"  Programmers at Yahoo wouldn't have asked that.
Theirs was not to reason why; theirs was to build what product
managers spec'd.  I remember coming away from Google thinking "Wow,
it's still a startup."<br><br>There's not much we can learn from Yahoo's first fatal flaw. It's
probably too much to hope any company could avoid being damaged by
depending on a bogus source of revenue.  But startups can learn an
important lesson from the second one.  In the software business,
you can't afford not to have a hacker-centric culture.<br><br>Probably the most impressive commitment I've heard to having a
hacker-centric culture came from Mark Zuckerberg, when he spoke at
Startup School in 2007.  He said that in the early days Facebook
made a point of hiring programmers even for jobs that would not
ordinarily consist of programming, like HR and marketing.<br><br>So which companies need to have a hacker-centric culture?  Which
companies are "in the software business" in this respect?  As Yahoo
discovered, the area covered by this rule is bigger than most people
realize.  The answer is: any company that needs to have good software.<br><br>Why would great programmers want to work for a company that didn't
have a hacker-centric culture, as long as there were others that
did?  I can imagine two reasons: if they were paid a huge amount,
or if the domain was interesting and none of the companies in it
were hacker-centric.  Otherwise you can't attract good programmers
to work in a suit-centric culture.  And without good programmers
you won't get good software, no matter how many people you put on
a task, or how many procedures you establish to ensure "quality."<br><br><a href="gba.html">Hacker culture</a> 
often seems kind of irresponsible.  That's why people
proposing to destroy it use phrases like "adult supervision." That
was the phrase they used at Yahoo.  But there are worse things than
seeming irresponsible.  Losing, for example.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
The closest we got to targeting when I was there was when we
created pets.yahoo.com in order to provoke a bidding war between 3
pet supply startups for the spot as top sponsor.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In theory you could beat the death spiral by buying good
programmers instead of hiring them.  You can get programmers
who would never have come to you as employees by buying their 
startups. But so far the only companies smart enough
to do this are companies smart enough not to need to.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
September 2010<br><br>The reason startups have been using 
<a href="http://twitter.com/paulg/status/22319113993">more convertible notes</a> in angel
rounds is that they make deals close faster.  By making it easier
for startups to give different prices to different investors, they
help them break the sort of deadlock that happens when investors
all wait to see who else is going to invest.<br><br>By far the biggest influence on investors' opinions of a startup
is the opinion of other investors.  There are very, very few who
simply decide for themselves.  Any startup founder can tell you the
most common question they hear from investors is not about the
founders or the product, but "who else is investing?"<br><br>That tends to produce deadlocks.  Raising an old-fashioned 
fixed-size equity round can take weeks, because all the angels sit around
waiting for the others to commit, like competitors in a bicycle
sprint who deliberately ride slowly at the start so they can follow
whoever breaks first.<br><br>Convertible notes let startups beat such deadlocks by rewarding
investors willing to move first with lower (effective) valuations.
Which they deserve because they're taking more risk.  It's much
safer to invest in a startup Ron Conway has already invested in;
someone who comes after him should pay a higher price.<br><br>The reason convertible notes allow more flexibility in price is
that valuation caps aren't actual valuations, and notes are cheap
and easy to do.  So you can do high-resolution fundraising: if you
wanted you could have a separate note with a different cap for each
investor.<br><br>That cap need not simply rise monotonically.  A startup could 
also give better deals to investors they expected to help
them most.  The point is simply that different investors, 
whether because of the help they offer or their willingness to
commit, have different values for
startups, and their terms should reflect that.<br><br>Different terms for different investors is
clearly the way of the future.  Markets always evolve toward higher
resolution.  You may not need to use convertible notes to do it.
With sufficiently lightweight standardized equity terms (and some
changes in investors' and lawyers' expectations about equity rounds)
you might be able to do the same thing with equity instead of debt.
Either would be fine with startups, so long as they can easily
change their valuation.<br><br>Deadlocks weren't the only problem with fixed-size equity rounds.
Another was that startups had to decide in advance how much to
raise.  I think it's a mistake for a startup to fix upon a specific
number. If investors are easily convinced, the startup should raise more
now, and if investors are skeptical, the startup should take a
smaller amount and use that to get the company to the point where
it's more convincing.<br><br>It's just not reasonable to expect startups to pick an optimal round
size in advance, because that depends on the reactions of investors,
and those are impossible to predict.<br><br>Fixed-size, multi-investor angel rounds are such a bad idea for
startups that one wonders why things were ever done that way.  One
possibility is that this custom reflects the way investors like to
collude when they can get away with it.  But I think the actual
explanation is less sinister.  I think angels (and their lawyers)
organized rounds this way in unthinking imitation of VC series A
rounds.  In a series A, a fixed-size equity round with a lead makes
sense, because there is usually just one big investor, who is
unequivocally the lead.  Fixed-size series A rounds already are
high res.  But the more investors you have in a round, the less
sense it makes for everyone to get the same price.<br><br>The most interesting question here may be what high res fundraising
will do to the world of investors.  Bolder investors will now get
rewarded with lower prices.  But more important, in a
hits-driven business, is that they'll be able to get into the deals
they want.  Whereas the "who else is investing?" type of investors
will not only pay higher prices, but may not be able to get into
the best deals at all.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Immad Akhund, Sam Altman, John Bautista, Pete Koomen,

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
October 2010<br><br>Silicon Valley proper is mostly suburban sprawl.  At first glance
it doesn't seem there's anything to see.  It's not the sort of place
that has conspicuous monuments.  But if you look, there are subtle
signs you're in a place that's different from other places.<br><br><b>1. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=stanford+university">Stanford
University</a></b><br><br>Stanford is a strange place.  Structurally it is to an ordinary
university what suburbia is to a city.  It's enormously spread out,
and feels surprisingly empty much of the time.  But notice the
weather.  It's probably perfect.  And notice the beautiful mountains
to the west.  And though you can't see it, cosmopolitan San Francisco
is 40 minutes to the north.  That combination is much of the reason
Silicon Valley grew up around this university and not some other
one.<br><br><b>2. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=university+and+ramona+palo+alto">University
Ave</a></b><br><br>A surprising amount of the work of the Valley is done in the cafes
on or just off University Ave in Palo Alto.  If you visit on a
weekday between 10 and 5, you'll often see founders pitching
investors.  In case you can't tell, the founders are the ones leaning
forward eagerly, and the investors are the ones sitting back with
slightly pained expressions.<br><br><b>3.  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=165+university+ave+palo+alto">The Lucky
Office</a></b><br><br>The office at 165 University Ave was Google's first.  Then it was
Paypal's.  (Now it's <a href="http://wepay.com">Wepay</a>'s.)  The interesting thing about it is
the location.  It's a smart move to put a startup in a place with
restaurants and people walking around instead of in an office park,
because then the people who work there want to stay there, instead
of fleeing as soon as conventional working hours end.  They go out
for dinner together, talk about ideas, and then come back and
implement them.<br><br>It's important to realize that Google's current location in an
office park is not where they started; it's just where they were
forced to move when they needed more space.  Facebook was till
recently across the street, till they too had to move because they
needed more space.<br><br><b>4. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=old+palo+alto">Old
Palo Alto</a></b><br><br>Palo Alto was not originally a suburb.  For the first 100 years or
so of its existence, it was a college town out in the countryside.
Then in the mid 1950s it was engulfed in a wave of suburbia that
raced down the peninsula.  But Palo Alto north of Oregon expressway
still feels noticeably different from the area around it.  It's one
of the nicest places in the Valley.  The buildings are old (though
increasingly they are being torn down and replaced with generic
McMansions) and the trees are tall.  But houses are very
expensive—around $1000 per square foot. This is post-exit
Silicon Valley.<br><br>
<b>5. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2900+sand+hill+road+menlo+park">Sand
Hill Road</a></b><br><br>It's interesting to see the VCs' offices on the north side of Sand
Hill Road precisely because they're so boringly uniform.  The
buildings are all more or less the same, their exteriors express
very little, and they are arranged in a confusing maze.  (I've been
visiting them for years and I still occasionally get lost.) It's
not a coincidence.  These buildings are a pretty accurate reflection
of the VC business.<br><br>If you go on a weekday you may see groups of founders there to meet
VCs. But mostly you won't see anyone; bustling is the last word
you'd use to describe the atmos.  Visiting Sand Hill Road reminds
you that the opposite of "down and dirty" would be "up and clean."<br><br><b>6.  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=castro+and+villa+mountain+view">Castro
Street</a></b><br><br>It's a tossup whether Castro Street or University Ave should be
considered the heart of the Valley now.  University Ave would have
been 10 years ago.  But Palo Alto is getting expensive.  Increasingly
startups are located in Mountain View, and Palo Alto is a place
they come to meet investors.  Palo Alto has a lot of different
cafes, but there is one that clearly dominates in Mountain View:
<a href="http://maps.google.com/places/us/ca/mountain-view/castro-st/201/-red-rock-coffee">Red
Rock</a>.<br><br><b>7. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=charleston+road+mountain+view">Google</a></b><br><br>Google spread out from its first building in Mountain View 
to a lot of the surrounding ones.  But because the
buildings were built at different times by different people,
the place doesn't have the sterile, walled-off feel that a typical
large company's headquarters have.  It definitely has a flavor of
its own though.  You sense there is something afoot.  The general
atmos is vaguely utopian; there are lots of Priuses, and people who
look like they drive them.<br><br>You can't get into Google unless you know someone there.  It's very
much worth seeing inside if you can, though.   Ditto for Facebook,
at the end of California Ave in Palo Alto, though there is nothing
to see outside.<br><br><b>8.  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=skylonda">Skyline
Drive</a></b><br><br>Skyline Drive runs along the crest of the Santa Cruz mountains.  On
one side is the Valley, and on the other is the sea—which
because it's cold and foggy and has few harbors, plays surprisingly
little role in the lives of people in the Valley, considering how
close it is.  Along some parts of Skyline the dominant trees are
huge redwoods, and in others they're live oaks.  Redwoods mean those
are the parts where the fog off the coast comes in at night; redwoods
condense rain out of fog.  The MROSD manages a collection of <a href="http://www.openspace.org/">great walking trails</a> off
Skyline.<br><br><b>9. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=interstate+280+san+mateo">280</a></b><br><br>Silicon Valley has two highways running the length of it: 101, which
is pretty ugly, and 280, which is one of the more beautiful highways
in the world.  I always take 280 when I have a choice.  Notice the
long narrow lake to the west? That's the San Andreas Fault.  It
runs along the base of the hills, then heads uphill through Portola
Valley.  One of the MROSD trails runs <a href="http://www.openspace.org/preserves/pr_los_trancos.asp">right along
the fault</a>.  A string of rich neighborhoods runs along the
foothills to the west of 280: Woodside, Portola Valley, Los Altos
Hills, Saratoga, Los Gatos.<br><br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/38037974@N00/3890299362/">SLAC</a> goes right under 280 a little bit south of Sand Hill Road.  And a couple miles south of that is the Valley's equivalent of the "Welcome to Las Vegas" sign: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulbarroga/3443486941/">The Dish</a>.<br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>I skipped the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/">Computer
History Museum</a> because this is a list of where to see the Valley
itself, not where to see artifacts from it.  I also skipped San
Jose.  San Jose calls itself the capital of Silicon Valley, but
when people in the Valley use the phrase "the city," they mean San
Francisco.  San Jose is a dotted line on a map.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, and Jessica Livingston

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
October 2010<br><br>After barely changing at all for decades, the startup funding
business is now in what could, at least by comparison, be called
turmoil.  At Y Combinator we've seen dramatic changes in the funding
environment for startups.  Fortunately one of them is much higher
valuations.<br><br>The trends we've been seeing are probably not YC-specific.  I wish
I could say they were, but the main cause is probably just that we
see trends first—partly because the startups we fund are very
plugged into the Valley and are quick to take advantage of anything
new, and partly because we fund so many that we have enough data
points to see patterns clearly.<br><br>What we're seeing now, everyone's probably going to be seeing in
the next couple years.  So I'm going to explain what we're seeing,
and what that will mean for you if you try to raise money.<br><br><b>Super-Angels</b><br><br>Let me start by describing what the world of startup funding used
to look like.  There used to be two sharply differentiated types
of investors: angels and venture capitalists.  Angels are individual
rich people who invest small amounts of their own money, while VCs
are employees of funds that invest large amounts of other people's.<br><br>For decades there were just those two types of investors, but now
a third type has appeared halfway between them: the so-called
super-angels. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
  And VCs have been provoked by their arrival
into making a lot of angel-style investments themselves.  So the
previously sharp line between angels and VCs has become hopelessly
blurred.<br><br>There used to be a no man's land between angels and VCs.  Angels
would invest $20k to $50k apiece, and VCs usually a million or more.
So an angel round meant a collection of angel investments that
combined to maybe $200k, and a VC round meant a series A round in
which a single VC fund (or occasionally two) invested $1-5 million.<br><br>The no man's land between angels and VCs was a very inconvenient
one for startups, because it coincided with the amount many wanted
to raise.  Most startups coming out of Demo Day wanted to raise
around $400k.  But it was a pain to stitch together that much out
of angel investments, and most VCs weren't interested in investments
so small.  That's the fundamental reason the super-angels have
appeared.  They're responding to the market.<br><br>The arrival of a new type of investor is big news for startups,
because there used to be only two and they rarely competed with one
another.  Super-angels compete with both angels and VCs.  That's
going to change the rules about how to raise money.  I don't know
yet what the new rules will be, but it looks like most of the changes
will be for the better.<br><br>A super-angel has some of the qualities of an angel, and some of
the qualities of a VC.  They're usually individuals, like angels.
In fact many of the current super-angels were initially angels of
the classic type.  But like VCs, they invest other people's money.
This allows them to invest larger amounts than angels:  a typical
super-angel investment is currently about $100k.  They make investment
decisions quickly, like angels.  And they make a lot more investments
per partner than VCs—up to 10 times as many.<br><br>The fact that super-angels invest other people's money makes them
doubly alarming to VCs. They don't just compete for startups; they
also compete for investors.  What super-angels really are is a new
form of fast-moving, lightweight VC fund.   And those of us in the
technology world know what usually happens when something comes
along that can be described in terms like that.  Usually it's the
replacement.<br><br>Will it be?  As of now, few of the startups that take money from
super-angels are ruling out taking VC money.  They're just postponing
it.  But that's still a problem for VCs.  Some of the startups that
postpone raising VC money may do so well on the angel money they
raise that they never bother to raise more.  And those who do raise
VC rounds will be able to get higher valuations when they do.  If
the best startups get 10x higher valuations when they raise series
A rounds, that would cut VCs' returns from winners at least tenfold.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>So I think VC funds are seriously threatened by the super-angels.
But one thing that may save them to some extent is the uneven
distribution of startup outcomes: practically all the returns are
concentrated in a few big successes.  The expected value of a startup
is the percentage chance it's Google.  So to the extent that winning
is a matter of absolute returns, the super-angels could win practically
all the battles for individual startups and yet lose the war, if
they merely failed to get those few big winners.  And there's a
chance that could happen, because the top VC funds have better
brands, and can also do more for their portfolio companies.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Because super-angels make more investments per partner, they have
less partner per investment.  They can't pay as much attention to
you as a VC on your board could.  How much is that extra attention
worth?  It will vary enormously from one partner to another.  There's
no consensus yet in the general case.  So for now this is something
startups are deciding individually.<br><br>Till now, VCs' claims about how much value they added were sort of
like the government's.  Maybe they made you feel better, but you
had no choice in the matter, if you needed money on the scale only
VCs could supply.  Now that VCs have competitors, that's going to
put a market price on the help they offer.  The interesting thing
is, no one knows yet what it will be.<br><br>Do startups that want to get really big need the sort of advice and
connections only the top VCs can supply?  Or would super-angel money
do just as well?  The VCs will say you need them, and the super-angels
will say you don't.  But the truth is, no one knows yet, not even
the VCs and super-angels themselves.   All the super-angels know
is that their new model seems promising enough to be worth trying,
and all the VCs know is that it seems promising enough to worry
about.<br><br><b>Rounds</b><br><br>Whatever the outcome, the conflict between VCs and super-angels is
good news for founders.  And not just for the obvious reason that
more competition for deals means better terms.  The whole shape of
deals is changing.<br><br>One of the biggest differences between angels and VCs is the amount
of your company they want.  VCs want a lot.  In a series A round
they want a third of your company, if they can get it.  They don't
care much how much they pay for it, but they want a lot because the
number of series A investments they can do is so small.  In a
traditional series A investment, at least one partner from the VC
fund takes a seat on your board.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
 Since board seats last about
5 years and each partner can't handle more than about 10 at once,
that means a VC fund can only do about 2 series A deals per partner
per year. And that means they need to get as much of the company
as they can in each one.  You'd have to be a very promising startup
indeed to get a VC to use up one of his 10 board seats for only a
few percent of you.<br><br>Since angels generally don't take board seats, they don't have this
constraint.  They're happy to buy only a few percent of you.  And
although the super-angels are in most respects mini VC funds, they've
retained this critical property of angels.  They don't take board
seats, so they don't need a big percentage of your company.<br><br>Though that means you'll get correspondingly less attention from
them, it's good news in other respects.  Founders never really liked
giving up as much equity as VCs wanted.  It was a lot of the company
to give up in one shot.  Most founders doing series A deals would
prefer to take half as much money for half as much stock, and then
see what valuation they could get for the second half of the stock
after using the first half of the money to increase its value.  But
VCs never offered that option.<br><br>Now startups have another alternative.  Now it's easy to raise angel
rounds about half the size of series A rounds.  Many of the startups
we fund are taking this route, and I predict that will be true of
startups in general.<br><br>A typical big angel round might be $600k on a convertible note with
a valuation cap of $4 million premoney.  Meaning that when the note
converts into stock (in a later round, or upon acquisition), the
investors in that round will get .6 / 4.6, or 13% of the company.
That's a lot less than the 30 to 40% of the company you usually
give up in a series A round if you do it so early.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>But the advantage of these medium-sized rounds is not just that
they cause less dilution.  You also lose less control.  After an
angel round, the founders almost always still have control of the
company, whereas after a series A round they often don't.  The
traditional board structure after a series A round is two founders,
two VCs, and a (supposedly) neutral fifth person.  Plus series A
terms usually give the investors a veto over various kinds of
important decisions, including selling the company.  Founders usually
have a lot of de facto control after a series A, as long as things
are going well.  But that's not the same as just being able to do
what you want, like you could before.<br><br>A third and quite significant advantage of angel rounds is that
they're less stressful to raise.  Raising a traditional series A
round has in the past taken weeks, if not months.  When a VC firm
can only do 2 deals per partner per year, they're careful about
which they do.  To get a traditional series A round you have to go
through a series of meetings, culminating in a full partner meeting
where the firm as a whole says yes or no.  That's the really scary
part for founders: not just that series A rounds take so long, but
at the end of this long process the VCs might still say no.  The
chance of getting rejected after the full partner meeting averages
about 25%.  At some firms it's over 50%.<br><br>Fortunately for founders, VCs have been getting a lot faster.
Nowadays Valley VCs are more likely to take 2 weeks than 2 months.
But they're still not as fast as angels and super-angels, the most
decisive of whom sometimes decide in hours.<br><br>Raising an angel round is not only quicker, but you get feedback
as it progresses.  An angel round is not an all or nothing thing
like a series A.  It's composed of multiple investors with varying
degrees of seriousness, ranging from the upstanding ones who commit
unequivocally to the jerks who give you lines like "come back to
me to fill out the round." You usually start collecting money from
the most committed investors and work your way out toward the
ambivalent ones, whose interest increases as the round fills up.<br><br>But at each point you know how you're doing.  If investors turn
cold you may have to raise less, but when investors in an angel
round turn cold the process at least degrades gracefully, instead
of blowing up in your face and leaving you with nothing, as happens
if you get rejected by a VC fund after a full partner meeting.
Whereas if investors seem hot, you can not only close the round
faster, but now that convertible notes are becoming the norm,
actually <a href="hiresfund.html">raise the price</a> to reflect demand.<br><br><b>Valuation</b><br><br>However, the VCs have a weapon they can use against the super-angels,
and they have started to use it.   VCs have started making angel-sized
investments too.  The term "angel round" doesn't mean that all the
investors in it are angels; it just describes the structure of the
round.  Increasingly the participants include VCs making investments
of a hundred thousand or two.  And when VCs invest in angel rounds
they can do things that super-angels don't like.  VCs are quite
valuation-insensitive in angel rounds—partly because they are
in general, and partly because they don't care that much about the
returns on angel rounds, which they still view mostly as a way to
recruit startups for series A rounds later.  So VCs who invest in
angel rounds can blow up the valuations for angels and super-angels
who invest in them. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Some super-angels seem to care about valuations.  Several turned
down YC-funded startups after Demo Day because their valuations
were too high.  This was not a problem for the startups; by definition
a high valuation means enough investors were willing to accept it.
But it was mysterious to me that the super-angels would quibble
about valuations.  Did they not understand that the big returns
come from a few big successes, and that it therefore mattered far
more which startups you picked than how much you paid for them?<br><br>After thinking about it for a while and observing certain other
signs, I have a theory that explains why the super-angels may be
smarter than they seem.  It would make sense for super-angels to
want low valuations if they're hoping to invest in startups that
get bought early.  If you're hoping to hit the next Google, you
shouldn't care if the valuation is 20 million.  But if you're looking
for companies that are going to get bought for 30 million, you care.
If you invest at 20 and the company gets bought for 30, you only
get 1.5x.  You might as well buy Apple.<br><br>So if some of the super-angels were looking for companies that could
get acquired quickly, that would explain why they'd care about
valuations.  But why would they be looking for those?   Because
depending on the meaning of "quickly," it could actually be very
profitable.  A company that gets acquired for 30 million is a failure
to a VC, but it could be a 10x return for an angel, and moreover,
a <i>quick</i> 10x return.  Rate of return is what matters in
investing—not the multiple you get, but the multiple per year.
If a super-angel gets 10x in one year, that's a higher rate of
return than a VC could ever hope to get from a company that took 6
years to go public.  To get the same rate of return, the VC would
have to get a multiple of 10^6—one million x.  Even Google
didn't come close to that.<br><br>So I think at least some super-angels are looking for companies
that will get bought.  That's the only rational explanation for
focusing on getting the right valuations, instead of the right
companies.  And if so they'll be different to deal with than VCs.
They'll be tougher on valuations, but more accommodating if you want
to sell early.<br><br><b>Prognosis</b><br><br>Who will win, the super-angels or the VCs?  I think the answer to
that is, some of each.  They'll each become more like one another.
The super-angels will start to invest larger amounts, and the VCs
will gradually figure out ways to make more, smaller investments
faster.  A decade from now the players will be hard to tell apart,
and there will probably be survivors from each group.<br><br>What does that mean for founders?  One thing it means is that the
high valuations startups are presently getting may not last forever.
To the extent that valuations are being driven up by price-insensitive
VCs, they'll fall again if VCs become more like super-angels and
start to become more miserly about valuations.  Fortunately if this
does happen it will take years.<br><br>The short term forecast is more competition between investors, which
is good news for you.  The super-angels will try to undermine the
VCs by acting faster, and the VCs will try to undermine the
super-angels by driving up valuations.  Which for founders will
result in the perfect combination: funding rounds that close fast,
with high valuations.<br><br>But remember that to get that combination, your startup will have
to appeal to both super-angels and VCs.  If you don't seem like you
have the potential to go public, you won't be able to use VCs to
drive up the valuation of an angel round.<br><br>There is a danger of having VCs in an angel round: the so-called
signalling risk.  If VCs are only doing it in the hope of investing
more later, what happens if they don't?  That's a signal to everyone
else that they think you're lame.<br><br>How much should you worry about that?  The seriousness of signalling
risk depends on how far along you are.  If by the next time you
need to raise money, you have graphs showing rising revenue or
traffic month after month, you don't have to worry about any signals
your existing investors are sending.  Your results will speak for
themselves.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Whereas if the next time you need to raise money you won't yet have
concrete results, you may need to think more about the message your
investors might send if they don't invest more.  I'm not sure yet
how much you have to worry, because this whole phenomenon of VCs
doing angel investments is so new. But my instincts tell me you
don't have to worry much.  Signalling risk smells like one of those
things founders worry about that's not a real problem.  As a rule,
the only thing that can kill a good startup is the startup itself.
Startups hurt themselves way more often than competitors hurt them,
for example.  I suspect signalling risk is in this category too.<br><br>One thing YC-funded startups have been doing to mitigate the risk
of taking money from VCs in angel rounds is not to take too much
from any one VC.  Maybe that will help, if you have the luxury of
turning down money.<br><br>Fortunately, more and more startups will.  After decades of competition
that could best be described as intramural, the startup funding
business is finally getting some real competition.  That should
last several years at least, and maybe a lot longer. Unless there's
some huge market crash, the next couple years are going to be a
good time for startups to raise money.  And that's exciting because
it means lots more startups will happen.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I've also heard them called "Mini-VCs" and "Micro-VCs." I
don't know which name will stick.<br><br>There were a couple predecessors.  Ron Conway had angel funds
starting in the 1990s, and in some ways First Round Capital is closer to a
super-angel than a VC fund.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
It wouldn't cut their overall returns tenfold, because investing
later would probably (a) cause them to lose less on investments
that failed, and (b) not allow them to get as large a percentage
of startups as they do now.  So it's hard to predict precisely what
would happen to their returns.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The brand of an investor derives mostly from the success of
their portfolio companies.  The top VCs thus have a big brand
advantage over the super-angels.  They could make it self-perpetuating
if they used it to get all the best new startups.  But I don't think
they'll be able to.  To get all the best startups, you have to do
more than make them want you.  You also have to want them; you have
to recognize them when you see them, and that's much harder.
Super-angels will snap up stars that VCs miss.  And that will cause
the brand gap between the top VCs and the super-angels gradually
to erode.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Though in a traditional series A round VCs put two partners
on your board, there are signs now that VCs may begin to conserve
board seats by switching to what used to be considered an angel-round
board, consisting of two founders and one VC.  Which is also to the
founders' advantage if it means they still control the company.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
In a series A round, you usually have to give up more than
the actual amount of stock the VCs buy, because they insist you
dilute yourselves to set aside an "option pool" as well.  I predict
this practice will gradually disappear though.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
The best thing for founders, if they can get it, is a convertible
note with no valuation cap at all.  In that case the money invested
in the angel round just converts into stock at the valuation of the
next round, no matter how large.  Angels and super-angels tend not
to like uncapped notes. They have no idea how much of the company
they're buying.  If the company does well and the valuation of the
next round is high, they may end up with only a sliver of it.  So
by agreeing to uncapped notes, VCs who don't care about valuations
in angel rounds can make offers that super-angels hate to match.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Obviously signalling risk is also not a problem if you'll
never need to raise more money.  But startups are often mistaken
about that.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, John Bautista, Patrick Collison, James

<p>
October 2010
</p></font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
<i>(I wrote this for Forbes, who asked me to write something
about the qualities we look for in founders.  In print they had to cut
the last item because they didn't have room.)</i><br><br><b>1. Determination</b><br><br>This has turned out to be the most important quality in startup
founders.  We thought when we started Y Combinator that the most
important quality would be intelligence.  That's the myth in the
Valley. And certainly you don't want founders to be stupid.  But
as long as you're over a certain threshold of intelligence, what
matters most is determination.  You're going to hit a lot of
obstacles.  You can't be the sort of person who gets <a href="die.html">demoralized</a>
easily.<br><br>Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman of <a href="http://wepay.com">WePay</a> 
are a good example.  They're
doing a finance startup, which means endless negotiations with big,
bureaucratic companies.  When you're starting a startup that depends
on deals with big companies to exist, it often feels like they're
trying to ignore you out of existence.  But when Bill Clerico starts
calling you, you may as well do what he asks, because he is not
going away.<br><br>
<b>2. Flexibility</b><br><br>You do not however want the sort of determination implied by phrases
like "don't give up on your dreams."  The world of startups is so
unpredictable that you need to be able to modify your dreams on the
fly.  The best metaphor I've found for the combination of determination
and flexibility you need is a <a href="relres.html">running back</a>.  
He's determined to get
downfield, but at any given moment he may need to go sideways or
even backwards to get there.<br><br>The current record holder for flexibility may be Daniel Gross of
<a href="http://greplin.com">Greplin</a>.  He applied to YC with 
some bad ecommerce idea.  We told
him we'd fund him if he did something else.  He thought for a second,
and said ok.  He then went through two more ideas before settling
on Greplin.  He'd only been working on it for a couple days when
he presented to investors at Demo Day, but he got a lot of interest.
He always seems to land on his feet.<br><br>
<b>3. Imagination</b><br><br>Intelligence does matter a lot of course.  It seems like the type
that matters most is imagination.  It's not so important to be able
to solve predefined problems quickly as to be able to come up with
surprising new ideas.  In the startup world, most good ideas 
<a href="googles.html">seem
bad</a> initially.  If they were obviously good, someone would already
be doing them.  So you need the kind of intelligence that produces
ideas with just the right level of craziness.<br><br><a href="http://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a> is that kind of idea.  
In fact, when we funded Airbnb, we
thought it was too crazy.  We couldn't believe large numbers of
people would want to stay in other people's places.  We funded them
because we liked the founders so much.  As soon as we heard they'd
been supporting themselves by selling Obama and McCain branded
breakfast cereal, they were in.  And it turned out the idea was on
the right side of crazy after all.<br><br>
<b>4. Naughtiness</b><br><br>Though the most successful founders are usually good people, they
tend to have a piratical gleam in their eye.  They're not Goody
Two-Shoes type good.  Morally, they care about getting the big
questions right, but not about observing proprieties.  That's why
I'd use the word naughty rather than evil.  They delight in 
<a href="gba.html">breaking
rules</a>, but not rules that matter.  This quality may be redundant
though; it may be implied by imagination.<br><br>Sam Altman of <a href="http://loopt.com">Loopt</a> 
is one of the most successful alumni, so we
asked him what question we could put on the Y Combinator application
that would help us discover more people like him.  He said to ask
about a time when they'd hacked something to their advantage—hacked in the sense of beating the system, not breaking into
computers.  It has become one of the questions we pay most attention
to when judging applications.<br><br>
<b>5. Friendship</b><br><br>Empirically it seems to be hard to start a startup with just 
<a href="startupmistakes.html">one
founder</a>.  Most of the big successes have two or three.  And the
relationship between the founders has to be strong.  They must
genuinely like one another, and work well together.  Startups do
to the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock:
if it can be pulled apart, it will be.<br><br>Emmett Shear and Justin Kan of <a href="http://justin.tv">Justin.tv</a> 
are a good example of close
friends who work well together.  They've known each other since
second grade.  They can practically read one another's minds.  I'm
sure they argue, like all founders, but I have never once sensed
any unresolved tension between them.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston and Chris Steiner for reading drafts of this.<br><br></font></p></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

term for iPhones, iPads, and the corresponding things running
Android.  The closest to a general term seems to be "mobile devices,"
but that (a) applies to any mobile phone, and (b) doesn't really
capture what's distinctive about the iPad.<br><br>After a few seconds it struck me that what we'll end up calling
these things is tablets.  The only reason we even consider calling
them "mobile devices" is that the iPhone preceded the iPad.  If the
iPad had come first, we wouldn't think of the iPhone as a phone;
we'd think of it as a tablet small enough to hold up to your ear.<br><br>The iPhone isn't so much a phone as a replacement for a phone.
That's an important distinction, because it's an early instance of
what will become a common pattern.  Many if not most of the
special-purpose objects around us are going to be replaced by apps
running on tablets.<br><br>This is already clear in cases like GPSes, music players, and
cameras.  But I think it will surprise people how many things are
going to get replaced.  We funded one startup that's 
<a href="http://lockitron.com/">replacing keys</a>.
The fact that you can change font sizes easily means the iPad
effectively replaces reading glasses.  I wouldn't be surprised if
by playing some clever tricks with the accelerometer you could even
replace the bathroom scale.<br><br>The advantages of doing things in software on a single device are
so great that everything that can get turned into software will.
So for the next couple years, a good <a href="http://ycombinator.com/rfs8.html">recipe for startups</a>
will be to look around you for things that people haven't realized
yet can be made unnecessary by a tablet app.<br><br>In 1938 Buckminster Fuller coined the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeralization">ephemeralization</a> to
describe the increasing tendency of physical machinery to be replaced
by what we would now call software.  The reason tablets are going
to take over the world is not (just) that Steve Jobs and Co are
industrial design wizards, but because they have this force behind
them.  The iPhone and the iPad have effectively drilled a hole that
will allow ephemeralization to flow into a lot of new areas.  No one
who has studied the history of technology would want to underestimate
the power of that force.<br><br>I worry about the power Apple could have with this force behind
them.  I don't want to see another era of client monoculture like
the Microsoft one in the 80s and 90s.  But if ephemeralization is
one of the main forces driving the spread of tablets, that suggests
a way to compete with Apple: be a better platform for it.<br><br>It has turned out to be a great thing that Apple tablets have
accelerometers in them.  Developers have used the accelerometer in
ways Apple could never have imagined.  That's the nature of platforms.
The more versatile the tool, the less you can predict how people
will use it.  So tablet makers should be thinking: what else can
we put in there?  Not merely hardware, but software too.  What else
can we give developers access to?  Give hackers an inch and they'll
take you a mile.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, and
Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.<br><br><!-- <b>Note:</b> The original version of this essay used the term
"etherealization" instead of "ephemeralization," but apparently
the former was an alternative name suggested to Fuller by 
someone else; he preferred the latter. --><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
December 2010<br><br>Someone we funded is talking to VCs now, and asked me how common
it was for a startup's founders to retain control of the board after
a series A round.  He said VCs told him this almost never happened.<br><br>Ten years ago that was true.  In the past, founders rarely kept
control of the board through a series A.  The traditional series A
board consisted of two founders, two VCs, and one independent member.
More recently the recipe is often one founder, one VC, and one
independent.  In either case the founders lose their majority.<br><br>But not always.  Mark Zuckerberg kept control of Facebook's board
through the series A and still has it today.  Mark Pincus has kept
control of Zynga's too.  But are these just outliers?  How common
is it for founders to keep control after an A round?  I'd heard of
several cases among the companies we've funded, but I wasn't sure
how many there were, so I emailed the ycfounders list.<br><br>The replies surprised me.  In a dozen companies we've funded, the
founders still had a majority of the board seats after the series
A round.<br><br>I feel like we're at a tipping point here.  A lot of VCs still act
as if founders retaining board control after a series A is unheard-of.
A lot of them try to make you feel bad if you even ask — as if
you're a noob or a control freak for wanting such a thing.  But the
founders I heard from aren't noobs or control freaks.  Or if they
are, they are, like Mark Zuckerberg, the kind of noobs and control
freaks VCs should be trying to fund more of.<br><br>Founders retaining control after a series A is clearly heard-of.
And barring financial catastrophe, I think in the coming year it
will become the norm.<br><br>Control of a company is a more complicated matter than simply
outvoting other parties in board meetings.  Investors usually get
vetos over certain big decisions, like selling the company, regardless
of how many board seats they have.  And board votes are rarely
split.  Matters are decided in the discussion preceding the vote,
not in the vote itself, which is usually unanimous.  But if opinion
is divided in such discussions, the side that knows it would lose
in a vote will tend to be less insistent.  That's what board control
means in practice.  You don't simply get to do whatever you want;
the board still has to act in the interest of the shareholders; but
if you have a majority of board seats, then your opinion about
what's in the interest of the shareholders will tend to prevail.<br><br>So while board control is not total control, it's not imaginary
either.  There's inevitably a difference in how things feel within
the company.  Which means if it becomes the norm for founders to
retain board control after a series A, that will change the way
things feel in the whole startup world.<br><br>The switch to the new norm may be surprisingly fast, because the
startups that can retain control tend to be the best ones.  They're
the ones that set the trends, both for other startups and for VCs.<br><br>A lot of the reason VCs are harsh when negotiating with startups
is that they're embarrassed to go back to their partners looking
like they got beaten.  When they sign a termsheet, they want to be
able to brag about the good terms they got.  A lot of them don't
care that much personally about whether founders keep board control.
They just don't want to seem like they had to make concessions.
Which means if letting the founders keep control stops being perceived
as a concession, it will rapidly become much more common.<br><br>Like a lot of changes that have been forced on VCs, this change
won't turn out to be as big a problem as they might think. VCs will
still be able to convince; they just won't be able to compel.  And
the startups where they have to resort to compulsion are not the
ones that matter anyway.  VCs make most of their money from a few
big hits, and those aren't them.<br><br>Knowing that founders will keep control of the board may even help
VCs pick better.  If they know they can't fire the founders, they'll
have to choose founders they can trust.  And that's who they should
have been choosing all along.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, John Bautista, Trevor Blackwell, Paul

<a href="http://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>.   VCs miss good startups all the time, but it's extraordinarily
rare for one to talk about it publicly till long afterward.  So
that post is further evidence what a rare bird Fred is.  He's
probably the nicest VC I know.<br><br>Reading Fred's post made me go back and look at the emails I exchanged
with him at the time, trying to convince him to invest in Airbnb.
It was quite interesting to read.  You can see Fred's mind at work 
as he circles the deal.<br><br>Fred and the Airbnb founders have generously agreed to let me publish
this email exchange (with one sentence redacted about something
that's strategically important to Airbnb and not an important part
of the conversation).  It's an interesting illustration of an element
of the startup ecosystem that few except the participants ever see:
investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio
companies.  Hundreds if not thousands of conversations of this type
are happening now, but if one has ever been published, I haven't
seen it.  The Airbnbs themselves never even saw these emails at the
time.<br><br>We do a lot of this behind the scenes stuff at YC, because we invest
in such a large number of companies, and we invest so early that
investors sometimes need a lot of convincing to see their merits.
I don't always try as hard as this though.  Fred must 
have found me quite annoying.<br><br><br><br>

protected inventors from having their ideas stolen by big companies.
Maybe that was truer in the past, when more things were physical.
But regardless of whether patents are in general a good thing, there
do seem to be bad ways of using them.  And since bad uses of patents
seem to be increasing, there is an increasing call for patent reform.<br><br>The problem with patent reform is that it has to go through the
government.  That tends to be slow.  But recently I realized we can
also attack the problem downstream.  As well as pinching off the
stream of patents at the point where they're issued, we may in some
cases be able to pinch it off at the point where they're used.<br><br>One way of using patents that clearly does not encourage innovation
is when established companies with bad products use patents to
suppress small competitors with good products.  This is the type
of abuse we may be able to decrease without having to go through
the government.<br><br>The way to do it is to get the companies that are above pulling
this sort of trick to pledge publicly not to.  Then the ones that
won't make such a pledge will be very conspicuous.  Potential
employees won't want to work for them.  And investors, too, will
be able to see that they're the sort of company that competes by
litigation rather than by making good products.<br><br>Here's the pledge:
<blockquote>
    No first use of software patents against companies with less 
    than 25 people.
</blockquote>
I've deliberately traded precision for brevity.  The patent pledge
is not legally binding.  It's like Google's "Don't be evil." They
don't define what evil is, but by publicly saying that, they're
saying they're willing to be held to a standard that, say, Altria
is not.  And though constraining, "Don't be evil" has been good for
Google. Technology companies win by attracting the most productive
people, and the most productive people are attracted to employers
who hold themselves to a higher standard than the law requires.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The patent pledge is in effect a narrower but open source "Don't
be evil."  I encourage every technology company to adopt it.  If
you want to help fix patents, encourage your employer to.<br><br>Already most technology companies wouldn't sink to using patents
on startups.  You don't see Google or Facebook suing startups for
patent infringement. They don't need to.  So for the better technology
companies, the patent pledge requires no change in behavior.  They're
just promising to do what they'd do anyway.  And when all the
companies that won't use patents on startups have said so, the
holdouts will be very conspicuous.<br><br>The patent pledge doesn't fix every problem with patents.  It won't
stop patent trolls, for example; they're already pariahs.  But the
problem the patent pledge does fix may be more serious than the
problem of patent trolls.  Patent trolls are just parasites.  A
clumsy parasite may occasionally kill the host, but that's not its
goal.  Whereas companies that sue startups for patent infringement
generally do it with explicit goal of keeping their product off the
market.<br><br>Companies that use patents on startups are attacking innovation at
the root.  Now there's something any individual can do about this
problem, without waiting for the government: ask companies where
they stand.<br><br><br><br>
<a href="http://thepatentpledge.org">Patent Pledge Site</a><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes:</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Because the pledge is deliberately vague, we're going to need
common sense when intepreting it.  And even more vice versa: the
pledge is vague in order to make people use common sense when
interpreting it.<br><br>So for example I've deliberately avoided saying whether the 25
people have to be employees, or whether contractors count too.  If
a company has to split hairs that fine about whether a suit would
violate the patent pledge, it's probably still a dick move.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="http://k9ventures.com/blog/2011/04/27/modista/">The Investment That Didn't Happen</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
October 2011<br><br>If you look at a list of US cities sorted by population, the number
of successful startups per capita varies by orders of magnitude.
Somehow it's as if most places were sprayed with startupicide.<br><br>I wondered about this for years.  I could see the average town was
like a roach motel for startup ambitions: smart, ambitious people
went in, but no startups came out.  But I was never able to figure
out exactly what happened inside the motel—exactly what was
killing all the potential startups.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>A couple weeks ago I finally figured it out. I was framing the
question wrong.  The problem is not that most towns kill startups.
It's that death is the <a href="die.html">default</a> for startups,
and most towns don't save them.  Instead of thinking of most places
as being sprayed with startupicide, it's more accurate to think of
startups as all being poisoned, and a few places being sprayed with
the antidote.<br><br>Startups in other places are just doing what startups naturally do:
fail.  The real question is, what's <i>saving</i> startups in places
like Silicon Valley?
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Environment</b><br><br>I think there are two components to the antidote: being in a place
where startups are the cool thing to do, and chance meetings with
people who can help you.  And what drives them both is the number
of startup people around you.<br><br>The first component is particularly helpful in the first stage of
a startup's life, when you go from merely having an interest in
starting a company to actually doing it.  It's quite a leap to start
a startup.  It's an unusual thing to do. But in Silicon Valley it
seems normal.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>In most places, if you start a startup, people treat you as if
you're unemployed.  People in the Valley aren't automatically
impressed with you just because you're starting a company, but they
pay attention.  Anyone who's been here any amount of time knows not
to default to skepticism, no matter how inexperienced you seem or
how unpromising your idea sounds at first, because they've all seen
inexperienced founders with unpromising sounding ideas who a few
years later were billionaires.<br><br>Having people around you care about what you're doing is an
extraordinarily <a href="cities.html">powerful</a> force.  Even the
most willful people are susceptible to it.  About a year after we
started Y Combinator I said something to a partner at a well known
VC firm that gave him the (mistaken) impression I was considering
starting another startup.  He responded so eagerly that for about
half a second I found myself considering doing it.<br><br>In most other cities, the prospect of starting a startup just doesn't
seem real.  In the Valley it's not only real but fashionable.  That
no doubt causes a lot of people to start startups who shouldn't.
But I think that's ok.  Few people are suited to running a startup,
and it's very hard to predict beforehand which are (as I know all
too well from being in the business of trying to predict beforehand),
so lots of people starting startups who shouldn't is probably the
optimal state of affairs.  As long as you're at a point in your
life when you can bear the risk of failure, the best way to find
out if you're suited to running a startup is to <a href="notnot.html">try
it</a>.<br><br><b>Chance</b><br><br>The second component of the antidote is chance meetings with people
who can help you.  This force works in both phases: both in the
transition from the desire to start a startup to starting one, and
the transition from starting a company to succeeding.  The power
of chance meetings is more variable than people around you caring
about startups, which is like a sort of background radiation that
affects everyone equally, but at its strongest it is far stronger.<br><br>Chance meetings produce miracles to compensate for the disasters
that characteristically befall startups.  In the Valley, terrible
things happen to startups all the time, just like they do to startups
everywhere.  The reason startups are more likely to make it here
is that great things happen to them too.  In the Valley, lightning
has a sign bit.<br><br>For example, you start a site for college students and you decide
to move to the Valley for the summer to work on it.  And then on a
random suburban street in Palo Alto you happen to run into Sean
Parker, who understands the domain really well because he started
a similar startup himself, and also knows all the investors.  And
moreover has advanced views, for 2004, on founders retaining <a href="control.html">control</a> of their companies.<br><br>You can't say precisely what the miracle will be, or even for sure
that one will happen.  The best one can say is: if you're in a
startup hub, unexpected good things will probably happen to you,
especially if you deserve them.<br><br>I bet this is true even for startups we fund.  Even with us working
to make things happen for them on purpose rather than by accident,
the frequency of helpful chance meetings in the Valley is so high
that it's still a significant increment on what we can deliver.<br><br>Chance meetings play a role like the role relaxation plays in having
ideas.  Most people have had the experience of working hard on some
problem, not being able to solve it, giving up and going to bed,
and then thinking of the answer in the shower in the morning.  What
makes the answer appear is letting your thoughts <a href="top.html">drift</a> a bit—and thus drift off the wrong
path you'd been pursuing last night and onto the right one adjacent
to it.<br><br>Chance meetings let your acquaintance drift in the same way taking
a shower lets your thoughts drift. The critical thing in both cases
is that they drift just the right amount.  The meeting between Larry
Page and Sergey Brin was a good example.  They let their acquaintance
drift, but only a little; they were both meeting someone they had
a lot in common with.<br><br>For Larry Page the most important component of the antidote was
Sergey Brin, and vice versa.  The antidote is 
<a href="siliconvalley.html">people</a>.  It's not the
physical infrastructure of Silicon Valley that makes it work, or
the weather, or anything like that.  Those helped get it started,
but now that the reaction is self-sustaining what drives it is the
people.<br><br>Many observers have noticed that one of the most distinctive things
about startup hubs is the degree to which people help one another
out, with no expectation of getting anything in return.  I'm not
sure why this is so.  Perhaps it's because startups are less of a
zero sum game than most types of business; they are rarely killed
by competitors.  Or perhaps it's because so many startup founders
have backgrounds in the sciences, where collaboration is encouraged.<br><br>A large part of YC's function is to accelerate that process.  We're
a sort of Valley within the Valley, where the density of people
working on startups and their willingness to help one another are
both artificially amplified.<br><br><b>Numbers</b><br><br>Both components of the antidote—an environment that encourages
startups, and chance meetings with people who help you—are
driven by the same underlying cause: the number of startup people
around you.  To make a startup hub, you need a <i>lot</i> of people
interested in startups.<br><br>There are three reasons. The first, obviously, is that if you don't
have enough density, the chance meetings don't happen.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
The second is that different startups need such different things, so
you need a lot of people to supply each startup with what they need
most.  Sean Parker was exactly what Facebook needed in 2004.  Another
startup might have needed a database guy, or someone with connections
in the movie business.<br><br>This is one of the reasons we fund such a large number of companies,
incidentally.  The bigger the community, the greater the chance it
will contain the person who has that one thing you need most.<br><br>The third reason you need a lot of people to make a startup hub is
that once you have enough people interested in the same problem,
they start to set the social norms.  And it is a particularly
valuable thing when the atmosphere around you encourages you to do
something that would otherwise seem too ambitious.  In most places
the atmosphere pulls you back toward the mean.<br><br>I flew into the Bay Area a few days ago.  I notice this every time
I fly over the Valley: somehow you can sense something is going on.  
Obviously you can sense prosperity in how well kept a
place looks.  But there are different kinds of prosperity.  Silicon
Valley doesn't look like Boston, or New York, or LA, or DC.  I tried
asking myself what word I'd use to describe the feeling the Valley
radiated, and the word that came to mind was optimism.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I'm not saying it's impossible to succeed in a city with few
other startups, just harder.  If you're sufficiently good at
generating your own morale, you can survive without external
encouragement.  Wufoo was based in Tampa and they succeeded.  But
the Wufoos are exceptionally disciplined.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Incidentally, this phenomenon is not limited to startups.  Most
unusual ambitions fail, unless the person who has them manages to
find the right sort of community.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Starting a company is common, but starting a startup is rare.
I've talked about the distinction between the two elsewhere, but
essentially a startup is a new business designed for scale.  Most
new businesses are service businesses and except in rare cases those
don't scale.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
As I was writing this, I had a demonstration of the density of
startup people in the Valley.  Jessica and I bicycled to University
Ave in Palo Alto to have lunch at the fabulous Oren's Hummus.  As
we walked in, we met Charlie Cheever sitting near the door.  Selina
Tobaccowala stopped to say hello on her way out.  Then Josh Wilson
came in to pick up a take out order.  After lunch we went to get
frozen yogurt.  On the way we met Rajat Suri.  When we got to the
yogurt place, we found Dave Shen there, and as we walked out we ran
into Yuri Sagalov.  We walked with him for a block or so and we ran
into Muzzammil Zaveri, and then a block later we met Aydin Senkut.
This is everyday life in Palo Alto.  I wasn't trying to meet people;
I was just having lunch.  And I'm sure for every startup founder
or investor I saw that I knew, there were 5 more I didn't.  If Ron
Conway had been with us he would have met 30 people he knew.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, and

were a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage
used to just fit in the size window people typically used then.<br><br>Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts
and they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that
looked good, you had to render display text as images.<br><br>You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> logos.  We did that
as an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red
circle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how
few other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized
<a href="zero.html">why</a>.<br><br>On the <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/com.html">Company

Robert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm">Worm</a> that he
didn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree
to a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has
since <a href="http://ycombinator.com/people.html">relaxed</a> a bit
on that point.<br><br>Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the
course of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire
PhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases
was one <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/trevor.html">celebrating
his graduation</a>, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during
a meeting.<br><br>(Trevor also appears as <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/tlbwebdesign.html">Trevino

comparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes
were so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/cybercash.html">talk merchants
out of doing real time authorizations</a>.<br><br>The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the
<a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/tesdriv.html">test drive</a>.
It was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put
cgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our
software worked.<br><br>We had some <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/us.html">well
known users</a>.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the
most traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,
so it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.
I once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,
and it was about $300/month.<br><br>Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just
over 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what
at the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)
coming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even
colocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things
went wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or
more precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique
privilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to
share it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed
the Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his
stack of window air conditioners could keep up.<br><br>For describing pages, we had a template language called <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/rtml.html">RTML</a>, which
supposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after
Rtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,
and concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it
had syntax.<br><br>Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have
versions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so
we made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made
the version number <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/rel4.html">an
integer</a>.  That "version 4.0" icon was generated by our own
button generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made
with our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because
we wanted to experience what our users did.<br><br>At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search
engine called <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/shoprel.html">Shopfind</a>.  It
was pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler
that could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out
the products.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
January 2012<br><br>There are great startup ideas lying around unexploited right under
our noses.  One reason we don't see them is a phenomenon I call
<i>schlep blindness</i>.  Schlep was originally a Yiddish word but has
passed into general use in the US.  It means a tedious, unpleasant
task.<br><br>No one likes schleps, but hackers especially dislike them.  
Most hackers who start startups wish they could do it by just writing
some clever software, putting it on a server somewhere, and watching
the money roll in—without ever having to talk to users, or negotiate
with other companies, or deal with other people's broken code.
Maybe that's possible, but I haven't seen it.<br><br>One of the many things we do at Y Combinator is teach hackers about
the inevitability of schleps.  No, you can't start a startup by
just writing code.  I remember going through this realization myself.
There was a point in 1995 when I was still trying to convince myself
I could start a company by just writing code.  But I soon learned
from experience that schleps are not merely inevitable, but pretty
much what business consists of.  A company is defined by the schleps
it will undertake.  And schleps should be dealt with the same way
you'd deal with a cold swimming pool: just jump in.  Which is not
to say you should seek out unpleasant work per se, but that you
should never shrink from it if it's on the path to something great.<br><br>The most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps is that much
of it is unconscious.  Your unconscious won't even let you see ideas
that involve painful schleps.  That's schlep blindness.<br><br>The phenomenon isn't limited to startups.  Most people don't
consciously decide not to be in as good physical shape as Olympic
athletes, for example.  Their unconscious mind decides for them,
shrinking from the work involved.<br><br>The most striking example I know of schlep blindness is 
<a href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, or
rather Stripe's idea.  For over a decade, every hacker who'd ever
had to process payments online knew how painful the experience was.
Thousands of people must have known about this problem.  And yet
when they started startups, they decided to build recipe sites, or
aggregators for local events.  Why?  Why work on problems few care
much about and no one will pay for, when you could fix one of the
most important components of the world's infrastructure?  Because
schlep blindness prevented people from even considering the idea
of fixing payments.<br><br>Probably no one who applied to Y Combinator to work on a recipe
site began by asking "should we fix payments, or build a recipe
site?" and chose the recipe site.  Though the idea of fixing payments
was right there in plain sight, they never saw it, because their
unconscious mind shrank from the complications involved.  You'd
have to make deals with banks.  How do you do that?  Plus you're
moving money, so you're going to have to deal with fraud, and people
trying to break into your servers.  Plus there are probably all
sorts of regulations to comply with.  It's a lot more intimidating
to start a startup like this than a recipe site.<br><br>That scariness makes ambitious ideas doubly valuable.  In addition
to their intrinsic value, they're like undervalued stocks in the
sense that there's less demand for them among founders.  If you
pick an ambitious idea, you'll have less competition, because
everyone else will have been frightened off by the challenges
involved.  (This is also true of starting a startup generally.)<br><br>How do you overcome schlep blindness?  Frankly, the most valuable
antidote to schlep blindness is probably ignorance.  Most successful
founders would probably say that if they'd known when they were
starting their company about the obstacles they'd have to overcome,
they might never have started it.  Maybe that's one reason the most
successful startups of all so often have young founders.<br><br>In practice the founders grow with the problems.  But no one seems
able to foresee that, not even older, more experienced founders.
So the reason younger founders have an advantage is that they make
two mistakes that cancel each other out.  They don't know how much
they can grow, but they also don't know how much they'll need to.
Older founders only make the first mistake.<br><br>Ignorance can't solve everything though.  Some ideas so obviously
entail alarming schleps that anyone can see them.  How do you see
ideas like that?  The trick I recommend is to take yourself out of
the picture.  Instead of asking "what problem should I solve?" ask
"what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?"  If someone
who had to process payments before Stripe had tried asking that,
Stripe would have been one of the first things they wished for.<br><br>It's too late now to be Stripe, but there's plenty still broken in
the world, if you know how to see it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison,

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
January 2012<br><br>A year ago I noticed a pattern in the least successful startups
we'd funded: they all seemed hard to talk to.  It felt as if there
was some kind of wall between us.  I could never quite tell if they
understood what I was saying.<br><br>This caught my attention because earlier we'd noticed a pattern
among the most successful startups, and it seemed to hinge on a
different quality.  We found the startups that did best were the
ones with the sort of founders about whom we'd say "they can take
care of themselves."  The startups that do best are fire-and-forget
in the sense that all you have to do is give them a lead, and they'll
close it, whatever type of lead it is.  When they're raising money,
for example, you can do the initial intros knowing that if you
wanted to you could stop thinking about it at that point.  You won't
have to babysit the round to make sure it happens.  That type of
founder is going to come back with the money; the only question is
how much on what terms.<br><br>It seemed odd that the outliers at the two ends of the spectrum
could be detected by what appeared to be unrelated tests.  You'd
expect that if the founders at one end were distinguished by the
presence of quality x, at the other end they'd be distinguished by
lack of x.  Was there some kind of inverse relation between
<a href="relres.html">resourcefulness</a> and being hard to talk to?<br><br>It turns out there is, and the key to the mystery is the old adage
"a word to the wise is sufficient."   Because this phrase is not
only overused, but overused in an indirect way (by prepending the
subject to some advice), most people who've heard it don't know
what it means.  What it means is that if someone is wise, all you
have to do is say one word to them, and they'll understand immediately.
You don't have to explain in detail; they'll chase down all the
implications.<br><br>In much the same way that all you have to do is give the right sort
of founder a one line intro to a VC, and he'll chase down the money.
That's the connection.  Understanding all the implications — even the
inconvenient implications — of what someone tells you is a subset of
resourcefulness.  It's conversational resourcefulness.<br><br>Like real world resourcefulness, conversational resourcefulness
often means doing things you don't want to.  Chasing down all the
implications of what's said to you can sometimes lead to uncomfortable
conclusions.  The best word to describe the failure to do so is
probably "denial," though that seems a bit too narrow.  A better
way to describe the situation would be to say that the unsuccessful
founders had the sort of conservatism that comes from weakness.
They traversed idea space as gingerly as a very old person
traverses the physical world.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The unsuccessful founders weren't stupid.  Intellectually they
were as capable as
the successful founders of following all the implications of what
one said to them.  They just weren't eager to.<br><br>So being hard to talk to was not what was killing the
unsuccessful startups.  It
was a sign of an underlying lack of resourcefulness.  That's what
was killing them.  As well as
failing to chase down the implications of what was said to them,
the unsuccessful founders would also fail to chase down funding,
and users, and sources of new ideas.  But the most immediate evidence
I had that something was amiss was that I couldn't talk to them.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
A YC partner wrote:<br><br>My feeling with the bad groups is that coming into office hours,
they've already decided what they're going to do and everything I
say is being put through an internal process in their heads, which
either desperately tries to munge what I've said into something
that conforms with their decision or just outright dismisses it and
creates a rationalization for doing so. They may not even be conscious
of this process but that's what I think is happening when you say
something to bad groups and they have that glazed over look. I don't
think it's confusion or lack of understanding per se, it's this
internal process at work.<br><br>With the good groups, you can tell that everything you say is being
looked at with fresh eyes and even if it's dismissed, it's because
of some logical reason e.g. "we already tried that" or "from speaking
to our users that isn't what they'd like," etc. Those groups never
have that glazed over look.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, Aaron Iba, Jessica Livingston,

<p>
March 2012<br><br>One of the more surprising things I've noticed while working
on Y Combinator is how frightening the most ambitious startup
ideas are.  In this essay I'm going to demonstrate
this phenomenon by describing some.  Any one of them
could make you a billionaire.  That might sound like an attractive
prospect, and yet when I describe these ideas you may
notice you find yourself shrinking away from them.<br><br>Don't worry, it's not a sign of weakness.  Arguably it's a sign of
sanity.  The biggest startup ideas are terrifying.  And not just
because they'd be a lot of work.  The biggest ideas seem to threaten
your identity: you wonder if you'd have enough ambition to carry
them through.<br><br>There's a scene in <i>Being John Malkovich</i> where the nerdy hero
encounters a very attractive, sophisticated woman.  She says to
him:
</p><blockquote>
  Here's the thing: If you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue
  what to do with me.
</blockquote>
That's what these ideas say to us.<br><br>This phenomenon is one of the most important things you can understand
about startups.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
You'd expect big startup ideas to be
attractive, but actually they tend to repel you.  And that has a
bunch of consequences.  It means these ideas are invisible to most
people who try to think of startup ideas, because their subconscious
filters them out.  Even the most ambitious people are probably best
off approaching them obliquely.<br><br><b>1. A New Search Engine</b><br><br>The best ideas are just on the right side of impossible.  I don't
know if this one is possible, but there are signs it might be.
Making a new search engine means competing with Google, and recently
I've noticed some cracks in their fortress.<br><br>The point when it became clear to me that Microsoft had lost their
way was when they decided to get into the search business.  That
was not a natural move for Microsoft.  They did it because they
were afraid of Google, and Google was in the search business.  But
this meant (a) Google was now setting Microsoft's agenda, and (b)
Microsoft's agenda consisted of stuff they weren't good at.<br><br>Microsoft : Google :: Google : Facebook.<br><br>That does not by itself mean
there's room for a new search engine, but lately when using Google
search I've found myself nostalgic for the old days, when
Google was true to its own slightly aspy self.  Google used to give
me a page of the right answers, fast, with no clutter.  Now the
results seem inspired by the Scientologist principle that what's
true is what's true for you.  And the pages don't have the
clean, sparse feel they used to.  Google search results used to
look like the output of a Unix utility.  Now if I accidentally put
the cursor in the wrong place, anything might happen.<br><br>The way to win here is to build the search engine all the hackers
use.  A search engine whose users consisted of the top 10,000 hackers
and no one else would be in a very powerful position despite its
small size, just as Google was when it was that search engine.  And
for the first time in over a decade the idea of switching seems
thinkable to me.<br><br>Since anyone capable of starting this company is one of those 10,000
hackers, the route is at least straightforward: make the search
engine you yourself want.  Feel free to make it excessively hackerish.
Make it really good for code search, for example.  Would you like
search queries to be Turing complete?  Anything that gets you those
10,000 users is ipso facto good.<br><br>Don't worry if something you want to do will constrain you in the
long term, because if you don't get that initial core of users,
there won't be a long term.  If you can just build something that
you and your friends genuinely prefer to Google, you're already
about 10% of the way to an IPO, just as Facebook was (though they
probably didn't realize it) when they got all the Harvard undergrads.<br><br><b>2. Replace Email</b><br><br>Email was not designed to be used the way we use it now.  Email is
not a messaging protocol.  It's a todo list.  Or rather, my inbox
is a todo list, and email is the way things get onto it.  But it
is a disastrously bad todo list.<br><br>I'm open to different types of solutions to this problem, but I
suspect that tweaking the inbox is not enough, and that email has
to be replaced with a new protocol. 
This new protocol should be a todo list protocol, not
a messaging protocol, although there is a degenerate case where
what someone wants you to do is: read the following text.<br><br>As a todo list protocol, the new protocol should give more power
to the recipient than email does.  I want there to be more restrictions
on what someone can put on my todo list.  And when someone can put
something on my todo list, I want them to tell me more about what
they want from me.  Do they want me to do something beyond just
reading some text?  How important is it?  (There obviously has to
be some mechanism to prevent people from saying everything is
important.)  When does it have to be done?<br><br>This is one of those ideas that's like an irresistible force meeting
an immovable object.  On one hand, entrenched protocols are impossible
to replace.  On the other, it seems unlikely that people in
100 years will still be living in the same email hell we do now.
And if email is going to get replaced eventually, why not now?<br><br>If you do it right, you may be able to avoid the usual chicken 
and egg problem new protocols face, because some of the most powerful
people in the world will be among the first to switch to it.  
They're all at the mercy of email too.<br><br>Whatever you build, make it fast.  GMail has become painfully slow.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
If you made something no better than GMail, but fast, that
alone would let you start to pull users away from GMail.<br><br>GMail is slow because Google can't afford to spend a lot on it.
But people will pay for this.  I'd have no problem paying $50 a month.
Considering how much time I spend in email, it's kind of scary to
think how much I'd be justified in paying.  At least $1000 a month.
If I spend several hours a day reading and writing email, that would
be a cheap way to make my life better.<br><br><b>3. Replace Universities</b><br><br>People are all over this idea lately, and I think they're onto
something.  I'm reluctant to suggest that an institution that's
been around for a millennium is finished just because of some mistakes
they made in the last few decades, but certainly in the last few
decades US universities seem to have been headed down the wrong
path.  One could do a lot better for a lot less money.<br><br>I don't think universities will disappear.  They won't be replaced
wholesale.  They'll just lose the de facto monopoly on certain types
of learning that they once had.  There will be many different ways
to learn different things, and some may look quite different from
universities.   Y Combinator itself is arguably one of them.<br><br>Learning is such a big problem that changing the way people do it
will have a wave of secondary effects.  For example, the name of
the university one went to is treated by a lot of people (correctly
or not) as a credential in its own right.  If learning breaks up
into many little pieces, credentialling may separate from it.  There
may even need to be replacements for campus social life (and oddly
enough, YC even has aspects of that).<br><br>You could replace high schools too, but there you face bureaucratic
obstacles that would slow down a startup.  Universities seem the
place to start.<br><br><b>4. Internet Drama</b><br><br>Hollywood has been slow to embrace the Internet.  That was a 
mistake, because I think we can now call a winner in the race between
delivery mechanisms, and it is the Internet, not cable.<br><br>A lot of the reason is the horribleness of cable clients, also known
as TVs.  Our family didn't wait for Apple TV.  We hated our last
TV so much that a few months ago we replaced it with an iMac bolted
to the wall.  It's a little inconvenient to control it with a
wireless mouse, but the overall experience is much better than the
nightmare UI we had to deal with before.<br><br>Some of the attention people currently devote to watching
movies and TV can be stolen by things that seem completely unrelated,
like social networking apps.  More can be stolen by things that are
a little more closely related, like games.  But there will probably
always remain some residual demand for conventional drama, where
you sit passively and watch as a plot happens.  So how do you deliver
drama via the Internet?  Whatever you make will have to be on a
larger scale than Youtube clips.  When people sit down to watch a
show, they want to know what they're going to get: either part
of a series with familiar characters, or a single longer "movie"
whose basic premise they know in advance.<br><br>There are two ways delivery and payment could play out.  Either
some company like Netflix or Apple will be the app store for
entertainment, and you'll reach audiences through them.  Or the
would-be app stores will be too overreaching, or too technically
inflexible, and companies will arise to supply payment and streaming
a la carte to the producers of drama.  If that's the way things
play out, there will also be a need for such infrastructure companies.<br><br><b>5. The Next Steve Jobs</b><br><br>I was talking recently to someone who knew Apple well, and I asked
him if the people now running the company would be able to keep
creating new things the way Apple had under Steve Jobs.  His answer
was simply "no."  I already feared that would be the answer.  I
asked more to see how he'd qualify it.  But he didn't qualify it
at all.  No, there will be no more great new stuff beyond whatever's
currently in the pipeline.  Apple's
revenues may continue to rise for a long time, but as Microsoft
shows, revenue is a lagging indicator in the technology business.<br><br>So if Apple's not going to make the next iPad, who is?  None of the
existing players.  None of them are run by product visionaries, and
empirically you can't seem to get those by hiring them.  Empirically
the way you get a product visionary as CEO is for him to found the
company and not get fired.  So the company that creates the next
wave of hardware is probably going to have to be a startup.<br><br>I realize it sounds preposterously ambitious for a startup to try
to become as big as Apple.  But no more ambitious than it was for
Apple to become as big as Apple, and they did it.  Plus a startup
taking on this problem now has an advantage the original Apple
didn't: the example of Apple.  Steve Jobs has shown us what's
possible.  That helps would-be successors both directly, as Roger
Bannister did, by showing how much better you can do than people
did before, and indirectly, as Augustus did, by lodging the idea
in users' minds that a single person could unroll the future 
for them. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Now Steve is gone there's a vacuum we can all feel.  If a new company
led boldly into the future of hardware, users would follow.  The
CEO of that company, the "next Steve Jobs," might not measure up
to Steve Jobs. But he wouldn't have to.  He'd just have to do a
better job than Samsung and HP and Nokia, and that seems pretty
doable.<br><br><b>6. Bring Back Moore's Law</b><br><br>The last 10 years have reminded us what Moore's Law actually says.
Till about 2002 you could safely misinterpret it as promising that
clock speeds would double every 18 months.  Actually what it says
is that circuit densities will double every 18 months.  It used to
seem pedantic to point that out.  Not any more.  Intel can no longer
give us faster CPUs, just more of them.<br><br>This Moore's Law is not as good as the old one.  Moore's Law used
to mean that if your software was slow, all you had to do was wait,
and the inexorable progress of hardware would solve your problems.
Now if your software is slow you have to rewrite it to do more
things in parallel, which is a lot more work than waiting.<br><br>It would be great if a startup could give us something of the old
Moore's Law back, by writing software that could make a large number
of CPUs look to the developer like one very fast CPU.  There are
several ways to approach this problem.  The most ambitious is to
try to do it automatically: to write a compiler that will parallelize
our code for us.  There's a name for this compiler, <i>the sufficiently
smart compiler,</i> and it is a byword for impossibility.  But is
it really impossible?  Is there no configuration of the bits in
memory of a present day computer that is this compiler?  If you
really think so, you should try to prove it, because that would be
an interesting result.  And if it's not impossible but simply very
hard, it might be worth trying to write it.  The expected value
would be high even if the chance of succeeding was low.<br><br>The reason the expected value is so high is web services.  If you
could write software that gave programmers the convenience of the
way things were in the old days, you could offer it to them as a
web service.  And that would in turn mean that you got practically
all the users.<br><br>Imagine there was another processor manufacturer that could still translate
increased circuit densities into increased clock speeds. They'd
take most of Intel's business.  And since web services mean that
no one sees their processors anymore, by writing the sufficiently
smart compiler you could create a situation indistinguishable from
you being that manufacturer, at least for the server market.<br><br>The least ambitious way of approaching the problem is to start from
the other end, and offer programmers more parallelizable Lego blocks
to build programs out of, like Hadoop and MapReduce.   Then the
programmer still does much of the work of optimization.<br><br>There's an intriguing middle ground where you build a semi-automatic
weapon—where there's a human in the loop.  You make something
that looks to the user like the sufficiently smart compiler, but
inside has people, using highly developed optimization tools to
find and eliminate bottlenecks in users' programs.   These people
might be your employees, or you might create a marketplace for
optimization.<br><br>An optimization marketplace would be a way to generate the sufficiently
smart compiler piecemeal, because participants would immediately
start writing bots.  It would be a curious state of affairs if you
could get to the point where everything could be done by bots,
because then you'd have made the sufficiently smart compiler, but
no one person would have a complete copy of it.<br><br>I realize how crazy all this sounds.  In fact, what I like about
this idea is all the different ways in which it's wrong.  The whole
idea of focusing on optimization is counter to the general trend
in software development for the last several decades.  Trying to
write the sufficiently smart compiler is by definition a mistake.
And even if it weren't, compilers are the sort of software that's
supposed to be created by open source projects, not companies.  Plus
if this works it will deprive all the programmers who take pleasure
in making multithreaded apps of so much amusing complexity. The
forum troll I have by now internalized doesn't even know where to
begin in raising objections to this project.  Now that's what I
call a startup idea.<br><br><b>7. Ongoing Diagnosis</b><br><br>But wait, here's another that could face even greater resistance:
ongoing, automatic medical diagnosis.<br><br>One of my tricks for generating startup ideas is to imagine the
ways in which we'll seem backward to future generations.  And I'm
pretty sure that to people 50 or 100 years in the future, it will
seem barbaric that people in our era waited till they had symptoms
to be diagnosed with conditions like heart disease and cancer.<br><br>For example, in 2004 Bill Clinton found he was feeling short of
breath.  Doctors discovered that several of his arteries were over
90% blocked and 3 days later he had a quadruple bypass.  It seems
reasonable to assume Bill Clinton has the best medical care available.
And yet even he had to wait till his arteries were over 90% blocked
to learn that the number was over 90%.  Surely at some point in the
future we'll know these numbers the way we now know something like
our weight.  Ditto for cancer.  It will seem preposterous to future
generations that we wait till patients have physical symptoms to
be diagnosed with cancer.  Cancer will show up on some sort of radar
screen immediately.<br><br>(Of course, what shows up on the radar screen may be different from
what we think of now as cancer.  I wouldn't be surprised if at any
given time we have ten or even hundreds of microcancers going at
once, none of which normally amount to anything.)<br><br>A lot of the obstacles to ongoing diagnosis will come from the fact
that it's going against the grain of the medical profession.  The
way medicine has always worked is that patients come to doctors
with problems, and the doctors figure out what's wrong.  A lot of
doctors don't like the idea of going on the medical equivalent of
what lawyers call a "fishing expedition," where you go looking for
problems without knowing what you're looking for.  They call the
things that get discovered this way "incidentalomas," and they are
something of a nuisance.<br><br>For example, a friend of mine once had her brain scanned as part
of a study.  She was horrified when the doctors running the study
discovered what appeared to be a large tumor.  After further testing,
it turned out to be a harmless cyst.  But it cost her a few days
of terror. A lot of doctors worry that if you start scanning people
with no symptoms, you'll get this on a giant scale: a huge number
of false alarms that make patients panic and require expensive and
perhaps even dangerous tests to resolve.  But I think that's just
an artifact of current limitations.  If people were scanned all the
time and we got better at deciding what was a real problem, my
friend would have known about this cyst her whole life and known
it was harmless, just as we do a birthmark.<br><br>There is room for a lot of startups here.  
In addition to the technical obstacles all
startups face, and the bureaucratic obstacles all medical startups
face, they'll be going against thousands of years of medical
tradition.  But it will happen, and it will be a great thing—so
great that people in the future will feel as sorry for us as we do
for the generations that lived before anaesthesia and antibiotics.<br><br><b>Tactics</b><br><br>Let me conclude with some tactical advice.  If you want to take on
a problem as big as the ones I've discussed, don't make a direct
frontal attack on it.  Don't say, for example, that you're going
to replace email.  If you do that you raise too many expectations.
Your employees and investors will constantly be asking "are we there
yet?" and you'll have an army of haters waiting to see you fail.
Just say you're building todo-list software.  That sounds harmless.
People can notice you've replaced email when it's a <i>fait accompli</i>.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Empirically, the way to do really big things seems to be to start
with deceptively small things.  Want to dominate microcomputer
software?  Start by writing a Basic interpreter for a machine with
a few thousand users.  Want to make the universal web site?  Start
by building a site for Harvard undergrads to stalk one another.<br><br>Empirically, it's not just for other people that you need to start
small.  You need to for your own sake.  Neither Bill Gates nor Mark
Zuckerberg knew at first how big their companies were going to get.
All they knew was that they were onto something.  Maybe it's a bad
idea to have really big ambitions initially, because the bigger
your ambition, the longer it's going to take, and the further you
project into the future, the more likely you'll get it wrong.<br><br>I think the way to use these big ideas is not to try to identify a
precise point in the future and then ask yourself how to get from
here to there, like the popular image of a visionary.  You'll be
better off if you operate like Columbus and just head in a general
westerly direction.  Don't try to construct the future like a
building, because your current blueprint is almost certainly mistaken.
Start with something you know works, and when you expand, expand
westward.<br><br>The popular image of the visionary is someone with a clear view of
the future, but empirically it may be better to have a blurry one.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
It's also one of the most important things VCs fail to
understand about startups.  Most expect founders to walk in with a
clear plan for the future, and judge them based on that.  Few
consciously realize that in the biggest successes there is the least
correlation between the initial plan and what the startup eventually
becomes.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]

Roger Bannister is famous as the first person to run a mile
in under 4 minutes.  But his world record only lasted 46 days.  Once
he showed it could be done, lots of others followed.  Ten years
later Jim Ryun ran a 3:59 mile as a high school junior.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
If you want to be the next Apple, maybe you don't even want to start
with consumer electronics.  Maybe at first you make something hackers
use.  Or you make something popular but apparently unimportant,
like a headset or router.  All you need is a bridgehead.<br><br>

century Japan called Ooka Tadasuke.  One of the cases he decided
was brought by the owner of a food shop.  A poor student who could
afford only rice was eating his rice while enjoying the delicious
cooking smells coming from the food shop.  The owner wanted the
student to pay for the smells he was enjoying.<br><br>The student was
stealing his smells!<br><br>This story often comes to mind when I hear the RIAA and MPAA accusing
people of stealing music and movies.<br><br>It sounds ridiculous to us to treat smells as property.  But I can
imagine scenarios in which one could charge for smells.  Imagine
we were living on a moon base where we had to buy air by the
liter.  I could imagine air suppliers adding scents at an extra
charge.<br><br>The reason it seems ridiculous to us to treat smells as property
is that it wouldn't work to.  It would work on a moon base, though.<br><br>What counts as property depends on what works to treat as property.
And that not only can change, but has changed.  Humans may always
(for some definition of human and always) have treated small items
carried on one's person as property.  But hunter gatherers didn't
treat land, for example, as property in the way we do.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The reason so many people think of property as having a single
unchanging definition is that its definition changes very slowly.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
But we are in the midst of such a change now.  The record
labels and movie studios used to distribute what they made like air
shipped through tubes on a moon base.  But with the arrival of
networks, it's as if we've moved to a planet with a breathable
atmosphere.  Data moves like smells now.  And through a combination
of wishful thinking and short-term greed, the labels and studios
have put themselves in the position of the food shop owner, accusing
us all of stealing their smells.<br><br>(The reason I say short-term greed is that the underlying problem
with the labels and studios is that the people who run them are
driven by bonuses rather than equity.  If they were driven by equity
they'd be looking for ways to take advantage of technological change
instead of fighting it.  But building new things takes too long.
Their bonuses depend on this year's revenues, and the best way to
increase those is to extract more money from stuff they do already.)<br><br>So what does this mean?  Should people not be able to charge for
content?  There's not a single yes or no answer to that question.
People should be able to charge for content when it works to charge
for content.<br><br>But by "works" I mean something more subtle than "when they can get
away with it."  I mean when people can charge for content without
warping society in order to do it.  After all, the companies selling
smells on the moon base could continue to sell them on the Earth,
if they lobbied successfully for laws requiring us all to continue
to breathe through tubes down here too, even though we no longer
needed to.<br><br>The crazy legal measures that the labels and studios have been
taking have a lot of that flavor.  Newspapers and magazines are
just as screwed, but they are at least declining gracefully.  The
RIAA and MPAA would make us breathe through tubes if they could.<br><br>Ultimately it comes down to common sense.  When you're abusing the
legal system by trying to use mass lawsuits against randomly chosen
people as a form of exemplary punishment, or lobbying for laws
that would break the Internet if they passed, that's ipso facto
evidence you're using a definition of property that doesn't work.<br><br>This is where it's helpful to have working democracies and multiple
sovereign countries.  If the world had a single, autocratic government,
the labels and studios could buy laws making the definition of
property be whatever they wanted.  But fortunately there are still
some countries that are not copyright colonies of the US, and even
in the US, <a href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/congress-on-sopa-done.png">politicians</a>
still seem to be afraid of actual voters, in sufficient numbers.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The people running the US may not like it when voters or other
countries refuse to bend to their will, but ultimately it's in all
our interest that there's not a single point of attack for people
trying to warp the law to serve their own purposes.  Private property
is an extremely useful idea — arguably one of our greatest inventions.
So far, each new definition of it has brought us increasing material
wealth.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
It seems reasonable to suppose the newest one will
too.  It would be a disaster if we all had to keep running an
obsolete version just because a few powerful people were too lazy
to upgrade.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
If you want to learn more about hunter gatherers I strongly
recommend Elizabeth Marshall Thomas's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harmless-People-Elizabeth-Marshall-Thomas/dp/0394427793"><i>The
Harmless People</i></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Old-Way-Story-First-People/dp/0374225524"><i>The
Old Way</i></a>.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Change in the definition of property is driven mostly by
technological progress, however, and since technological progress
is accelerating, so presumably will the rate of change in the
definition of property.  Which means it's all the more important
for societies to be able to respond gracefully to such changes,
because they will come at an ever increasing rate.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
As far as I know, the term "copyright colony" was first used
by <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/australia-us-copyright-colony-or-just-a-good-friend-120121/">Myles
Peterson</a>.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
The state of technology isn't simply a function of
the definition of property.  They each constrain the other.  But
that being so, you can't mess with the definition of property without
affecting (and probably harming) the state of technology.  The
history of the USSR offers a vivid illustration of that.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts

As usual we were so
busy we didn't notice till a few days after.  I don't think we've
ever managed to remember our birthday on our birthday.
<p>
On March 11 2005, Jessica and I were walking home from dinner in
Harvard Square.  Jessica was working at an investment bank at the
time, but she didn't like it much, so she had interviewed for a job
as director of marketing at a Boston VC fund.  The VC fund was doing
what now seems a comically familiar thing for a VC fund to do:
taking a long time to make up their mind.  Meanwhile I had been
telling Jessica all the things they should change about the VC
business � essentially the ideas now underlying Y&nbsp;Combinator:
investors
should be making more, smaller investments, they should be funding
hackers instead of suits, they should be willing to fund younger
founders, etc.
</p><p>
At the time I had been thinking about doing some angel investing.  I
had just given a talk to the undergraduate computer club at Harvard
about
<a href="start.html"><font color="#000099">how to start a
startup</font></a>, and it
hit me afterward that although I had always
meant to do angel investing, 7 years had now passed since I got
enough money to do it, and I still hadn't started.  I had also
been thinking about ways to work with Robert Morris and Trevor
Blackwell again.  A few hours before I had
sent them an email trying to figure out what we could do together.
</p><p>
Between Harvard Square and my house the idea gelled.  We'd start
our own investment firm and Jessica could work for that instead.
As we turned onto Walker Street we decided to do it.  I agreed to
put $100k into the new fund and Jessica agreed to quit her job to
work for it.  Over the next couple days I recruited Robert
and Trevor, who put in another $50k each.  So YC
started with $200k.
</p><p>
Jessica was so happy to be able to quit her job and start her own
company that I took her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609055553/http://www.ycombinator.com/yc05.html">picture</a>
 when we got home.
</p><p>
The company wasn't called Y Combinator yet. At first we called it
Cambridge Seed.  But that name never saw the light of day, because
by the time we announced it a few days later, we'd changed the name
to Y Combinator.  We realized early on that what we were doing could
be national in scope and we didn't want a name that tied us to one
place.
</p><p>
Initially we only had part of the idea. We were going to do
seed funding with standardized terms.  Before YC, seed funding was
very haphazard. You'd get that first $10k from your friend's rich
uncle. The deal terms were often a disaster; often neither the
investor nor the founders nor the lawyer knew what the documents
should look like.  Facebook's early history as a Florida LLC shows
how random things could be in those days.  We were going to be
something there had not been before: a standard source of seed
funding.
</p><p>
We modelled YC on the seed funding we ourselves had taken
when we started Viaweb.  We started Viaweb with $10k we got from
our friend <a href="julian.html"><font color="#000099">Julian Weber</font></a>,
the husband of Idelle Weber, whose
painting class I took as a grad student at Harvard.  Julian knew
about business, but you would not describe him as a suit.  Among
other things he'd been president of the <i>National Lampoon</i>.  He was
also a lawyer, and got all our paperwork set up properly.  In return
for $10k, getting us set up as a company, teaching us what
business was about, and remaining calm in times of crisis, Julian
got 10% of Viaweb.  I remember thinking once what a good deal
Julian got.  And then a second later I realized that without
Julian, Viaweb would never have made it.  So even though it was a
good deal for him, it was a good deal for us too.  That's why I
knew there was room for something like Y Combinator.
</p><p>
Initially we didn't have what turned out to be the most important
idea: funding startups synchronously, instead of asynchronously as
it had always been done before.  Or rather we had the idea, but we
didn't realize its significance.  We decided very early 
that the first thing we'd do would
be to fund a bunch of startups over the coming summer.  But we
didn't realize initially that this would be the way we'd do all our
investing.  The reason we began by funding a bunch of startups at
once was not that we thought it would be a better way to fund
startups, but simply because we wanted to learn how to be angel
investors, and a summer program for undergrads seemed the fastest
way to do it.  No one takes summer jobs that seriously.  The
opportunity cost for a bunch of undergrads to spend a summer working
on startups was low enough that we wouldn't feel guilty encouraging
them to do it.
</p><p>
We knew students would already be making plans for the summer, so
we did what we're always telling startups to do: we launched fast.
Here are the
initial <a href="summerfounder.html"><font color="#000099">announcement</font></a>
and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609055553/http://ycombinator.com/old/sfp.html">description</a> of what
was at the time called the Summer Founders Program.
</p><p>
We got lucky in that the length and structure of a summer program
turns out to be perfect for what we do.
The structure of the YC cycle is still almost identical to what
it was that first summer.
</p><p>
We also got lucky in who the first batch of founders were.  We never
expected to make any money from that first batch.  We thought of
the money we were investing as a combination of an educational expense
and a charitable donation.  But the
founders in the first batch turned out to be surprisingly good.
And great people too.  We're still friends with a lot of them today.
</p><p>
It's hard for people to realize now how inconsequential YC seemed at the
time.  I can't blame people who didn't take us seriously, because
we ourselves didn't take that first summer program seriously in the
very beginning.  But as the summer progressed we were increasingly
impressed by how well the startups were doing.  Other people started
to be impressed too.  Jessica and I invented a term, "the Y Combinator
effect," to describe the moment when the realization hit someone
that YC was not totally lame.  When people came to YC to speak
at the dinners that first summer, they came in the spirit of someone
coming to address a Boy Scout troop.  By the time they left the
building they were all saying some variant of "Wow, these
companies might actually succeed."
</p><p>
Now YC is well enough known that people are no longer surprised
when the companies we fund are legit, but it took a
while for reputation to catch up with reality.  That's one of the
reasons we especially like funding ideas that might be dismissed
as "toys" � because YC itself was dismissed as one initially.
</p><p>
When we saw how well it worked to fund companies synchronously,
we decided we'd keep doing that.  We'd fund two batches of
startups a year.
</p><p>
We funded the second batch in Silicon Valley.  That was
a last minute decision.  In retrospect I think what pushed me over
the edge was going to Foo Camp that fall.  The density of startup
people in the Bay Area was so much greater than in Boston, and the
weather was so nice.  I remembered that from living there in the
90s.  Plus I didn't want someone else to copy us and describe it
as the Y Combinator of Silicon Valley.  I wanted YC to be the Y&nbsp;Combinator 
of Silicon Valley.  So doing the winter batch in California
seemed like one of those rare cases where the self-indulgent choice
and the ambitious one were the same.
</p></font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
If we'd had enough time to do what we wanted, Y Combinator would
have been in Berkeley.  That was our favorite part of the Bay Area.
But we didn't have time to get a building in Berkeley.  We didn't
have time to get our own building anywhere. The only way to get
enough space in time was to convince Trevor to let us take over
part of his (as it then seemed) giant building in Mountain View.
Yet again we lucked out, because Mountain View turned out to be the
ideal place to put something like YC.  But even then we barely made
it.  The first dinner in California, we had to warn all the founders
not to touch the walls, because the paint was still wet.<br><br></font></p></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

I say "um" a lot. Sometimes I have
to pause when I lose my train of thought.  I wish I were a better
speaker.  But I don't wish I were a better speaker like I wish I
were a better writer.  What I really want is to have good ideas,
and that's a much bigger part of being a good writer than being a
good speaker.<br><br>Having good ideas is most of writing well.  If you know what you're
talking about, you can say it in the plainest words and you'll be
perceived as having a good style.  With speaking it's the opposite:
having good ideas is an alarmingly small component of being a good
speaker.<br><br>I first noticed this at a conference several years ago.
There was another speaker who was much better than me.
He had all of us roaring with laughter.  I seemed awkward and
halting by comparison.  Afterward I put my talk online like I usually
do.  As I was doing it I tried to imagine what a transcript of the
other guy's talk would be like, and it was only then I realized he
hadn't said very much.<br><br>Maybe this would have been obvious to someone who knew more about
speaking, but it was a revelation to me how much less ideas mattered
in speaking than writing.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>A few years later I heard a talk by someone who was not merely a
better speaker than me, but a famous speaker.  Boy was he good.  So
I decided I'd pay close attention to what he said, to learn how he
did it.  After about ten sentences I found myself thinking "I don't
want to be a good speaker."<br><br>Being a really good speaker is not merely orthogonal to having good ideas,
but in many ways pushes you in the opposite direction.  For example,
when I give a talk, I usually write it out beforehand.  I know that's
a mistake; I know delivering a 
<nota href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc">prewritten 
talk makes it harder to
engage with an audience.  The way to get the attention of an audience
is to give them <i>your</i> full attention, and when you're delivering
a prewritten talk, your attention is always divided between the
audience and the talk — even if you've memorized it.  If you want
to engage an audience, it's better to start with no more than an outline
of what you want to say and 
<nota href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmG9jzCHtSQ">ad lib the individual sentences.  But
if you do that, you might spend no more time thinking about each
sentence than it takes to say it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Occasionally the stimulation
of talking to a live audience makes you think of new things, but
in general this is not going to generate ideas as well as writing
does, where you can spend as long on each sentence as you want.<br><br>If you rehearse a prewritten speech enough, you can get
asymptotically close to the sort of engagement you get when speaking
ad lib.  Actors do.  But here again there's a tradeoff between
smoothness and ideas.  All the time you spend practicing a talk,
you could instead spend making it better.  Actors don't face
that temptation, except in the rare cases where they've written the
script, but any speaker does.  Before I give a talk I can usually
be found sitting in a corner somewhere with a copy printed out on
paper, trying to rehearse it in my head.  But I always end up
spending most of the time rewriting it instead.  Every talk I give
ends up being given from a manuscript full of things crossed out
and rewritten.  Which of course makes me um even more, because I
haven't had any time to practice the new bits.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Depending on your audience, there are even worse tradeoffs than
these.  Audiences like to be flattered; they like jokes; they like
to be swept off their feet by a vigorous stream of words.  As you
decrease the intelligence of the audience, being a good speaker is
increasingly a matter of being a good bullshitter.  That's true in
writing too of course, but the descent is steeper with talks.  Any
given person is dumber as a member of an audience than as a reader.
Just as a speaker ad libbing can only spend as long thinking about
each sentence as it takes to say it, a person hearing a talk can
only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to hear
it.  Plus people in an audience are always affected by the reactions
of those around them, and the reactions that spread from person to
person in an audience are disproportionately the more brutish sort,
just as low notes travel through walls better than high ones.  Every
audience is an incipient mob, and a good speaker uses that.  Part
of the reason I laughed so much at the talk by the good speaker at
that conference was that everyone else did.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>So are talks useless?  They're certainly inferior to the written
word as a source of ideas.  But that's not all talks are good for.
When I go to a talk, it's usually because I'm interested in the
speaker.  Listening to a talk is the closest most of us can get to
having a conversation with someone like the president, who doesn't
have time to meet individually with all the people who want to meet
him.<br><br>Talks are also good at motivating me to do things.  It's probably
no coincidence that so many famous speakers are described as
motivational speakers.  That may be what public speaking is really
for.  It's probably what it was originally for.  The emotional
reactions you can elicit with a talk can be a powerful force.
I wish I could say that this force was more often used for good than
ill, but I'm not sure.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I'm not talking here about academic talks, which are a 
different type of thing.  While the
audience at an academic talk might appreciate a joke, they will (or
at least should) make a conscious effort to see what new ideas
you're presenting.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
That's the lower bound.  In practice you can often do better,
because talks are usually about things you've written or talked
about before, and when you ad lib, you end up reproducing some of
those sentences.  Like early medieval architecture, impromptu talks
are made of spolia.  Which feels a bit dishonest, incidentally,
because you have to deliver these sentences as if you'd just thought
of them.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Robert Morris points out that there is a way in which practicing
talks makes them better: reading a talk out loud can expose awkward
parts.  I agree and in fact I read most things I write out loud at
least once for that reason.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
For sufficiently small audiences, it may not be true that being
part of an audience makes people dumber.  The real decline seems
to set in when the audience gets too big for the talk to feel like
a conversation — maybe around 10 people.<br><br>

biggest <a href="http://bronnieware.com/regrets-of-the-dying/">regrets
of the dying</a>.  Her list seems plausible.  I could see
myself — <i>can</i> see myself — making at least 4 of these
5 mistakes.<br><br>If you had to compress them into a single piece of advice, it might
be: don't be a cog.  The 5 regrets paint a portrait of post-industrial
man, who shrinks himself into a shape that fits his circumstances,
then turns dutifully till he stops.<br><br>The alarming thing is, the mistakes that produce these regrets are
all errors of omission.  You forget your dreams, ignore your family,
suppress your feelings, neglect your friends, and forget to be
happy.  Errors of omission are a particularly dangerous type of
mistake, because you make them by default.<br><br>I would like to avoid making these mistakes.  But how do you avoid
mistakes you make by default?  Ideally you transform your life so
it has other defaults.  But it may not be possible to do that
completely. As long as these mistakes happen by default, you probably
have to be reminded not to make them.  So I inverted the 5 regrets,
yielding a list of 5 commands
<blockquote>
   Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you
   think; cultivate friendships; be happy.
</blockquote>
which I then put at the top of the file I use as a todo list.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://note.com/tokyojack/n/n2e6a78d2e1e3">Japanese Translation</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
September 2012<br><br>I've done several types of work over the years but I don't know
another as counterintuitive as startup investing.<br><br>The two most important things to understand about startup investing,
as a business, are (1) that effectively all the returns are
concentrated in a few big winners, and (2) that the best ideas look
initially like bad ideas.<br><br>The first rule I knew intellectually, but didn't really grasp till
it happened to us.  The total value of the companies we've funded
is around 10 billion, give or take a few.  But just two companies,
Dropbox and Airbnb, account for about three quarters of it.<br><br>In startups, the big winners are big to a degree that violates our
expectations about variation.  I don't know whether these expectations
are innate or learned, but whatever the cause, we are just not
prepared for the 1000x variation in outcomes that one finds in
startup investing.<br><br>That yields all sorts of strange consequences.  For example, in
purely financial terms, there is probably at most one company in
each YC batch that will have a significant effect on our returns,
and the rest are just a cost of doing business.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
I haven't
really assimilated that fact, partly because it's so counterintuitive,
and partly because we're not doing this just for financial reasons;
YC would be a pretty lonely place if we only had one company per
batch.  And yet it's true.<br><br>To succeed in a domain that violates your intuitions, you need to
be able to turn them off the way a pilot does when flying through
clouds. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
  You need to do what you know intellectually to be
right, even though it feels wrong.<br><br>It's a constant battle for us.  It's hard to make ourselves take
enough risks. When you interview a startup and think "they seem
likely to succeed," it's hard not to fund them.  And yet, financially
at least, there is only one kind of success: they're either going
to be one of the really big winners or not, and if not it doesn't
matter whether you fund them, because even if they succeed the
effect on your returns will be insignificant.  In the same day of
interviews you might meet some smart 19 year olds who aren't even
sure what they want to work on. Their chances of succeeding seem
small.  But again, it's not their chances of succeeding that matter
but their chances of succeeding really big.  The probability that
any group will succeed really big is microscopically small, but the
probability that those 19 year olds will might be higher than that
of the other, safer group.<br><br>The probability that a startup will make it big is not simply a
constant fraction of the probability that they will succeed at all.
If it were, you could fund everyone who seemed likely to succeed
at all, and you'd get that fraction of big hits.  Unfortunately
picking winners is harder than that.  You have to ignore the elephant
in front of you, the likelihood they'll succeed, and focus instead
on the separate and almost invisibly intangible question of whether
they'll succeed really big.<br><br><b>Harder</b><br><br>That's made harder by the fact that the best startup ideas seem at
first like bad ideas.  I've written about this before: if a good
idea were obviously good, someone else would already have done it.
So the most successful founders tend to work on ideas that few
beside them realize are good.  Which is not that far from a description
of insanity, till you reach the point where you see results.<br><br>The first time Peter Thiel spoke at YC he drew a Venn diagram that
illustrates the situation perfectly.  He drew two intersecting
circles, one labelled "seems like a bad idea" and the other "is a
good idea."  The intersection is the sweet spot for startups.<br><br>This concept is a simple one and yet seeing it as a Venn diagram
is illuminating.  It reminds you that there is an intersection—that
there are good ideas that seem bad.  It also reminds you that the
vast majority of ideas that seem bad are bad.<br><br>The fact that the best ideas seem like bad ideas makes it even
harder to recognize the big winners.  It means the probability of
a startup making it really big is not merely not a constant fraction
of the probability that it will succeed, but that the startups with
a high probability of the former will seem to have a disproportionately
low probability of the latter.<br><br>History tends to get rewritten by big successes, so that in retrospect
it seems obvious they were going to make it big.  For that reason
one of my most valuable memories is how lame Facebook sounded to
me when I first heard about it.  A site for college students to
waste time?  It seemed the perfect bad idea: a site (1) for a niche
market (2) with no money (3) to do something that didn't matter.<br><br>One could have described Microsoft and Apple in exactly the same
terms.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Harder Still</b><br><br>Wait, it gets worse.  You not only have to solve this hard problem,
but you have to do it with no indication of whether you're succeeding.
When you pick a big winner, you won't know it for two years.<br><br>Meanwhile, the one thing you <i>can</i> measure is dangerously
misleading.  The one thing we can track precisely is how well the
startups in each batch do at fundraising after Demo Day.  But we
know that's the wrong metric.  There's no correlation between the
percentage of startups that raise money and the metric that does
matter financially, whether that batch of startups contains a big
winner or not.<br><br>Except an inverse one.  That's the scary thing: fundraising is not
merely a useless metric, but positively misleading.  We're in a
business where we need to pick unpromising-looking outliers, and
the huge scale of the successes means we can afford to spread our
net very widely.  The big winners could generate 10,000x returns.
That means for each big winner we could pick a thousand companies
that returned nothing and still end up 10x ahead.<br><br>If we ever got to the point where 100% of the startups we funded
were able to raise money after Demo Day, it would almost certainly
mean we were being too conservative.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>It takes a conscious effort not to do that too.  After 15 cycles
of preparing startups for investors and then watching how they do,
I can now look at a group we're interviewing through Demo Day
investors' eyes.  But those are the wrong eyes to look through!<br><br>We can afford to take at least 10x as much risk as Demo Day investors.
And since risk is usually proportionate to reward, if you can afford
to take more risk you should.  What would it mean to take 10x more
risk than Demo Day investors?  We'd have to be willing to fund 10x
more startups than they would.  Which means that even if we're
generous to ourselves and assume that YC can on average triple a
startup's expected value, we'd be taking the right amount of risk
if only 30% of the startups were able to raise significant funding
after Demo Day.<br><br>I don't know what fraction of them currently raise more after Demo
Day.  I deliberately avoid calculating that number, because if you
start measuring something you start optimizing it, and I know it's
the wrong thing to optimize.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
But the percentage is certainly
way over 30%.  And frankly the thought of a 30% success rate at
fundraising makes my stomach clench.  A Demo Day where only 30% of
the startups were fundable would be a shambles.  Everyone would
agree that YC had jumped the shark. We ourselves would feel that
YC had jumped the shark.  And yet we'd all be wrong.<br><br>For better or worse that's never going to be more than a thought
experiment.  We could never stand it.  How about that for
counterintuitive?  I can lay out what I know to be the right thing
to do, and still not do it.  I can make up all sorts of plausible
justifications.  It would hurt YC's brand (at least among the
innumerate) if we invested in huge numbers of risky startups that
flamed out.  It might dilute the value of the alumni network.
Perhaps most convincingly, it would be demoralizing for us to be
up to our chins in failure all the time.  But I know the real reason
we're so conservative is that we just haven't assimilated the fact
of 1000x variation in returns.<br><br>We'll probably never be able to bring ourselves to take risks
proportionate to the returns in this business.  The best we can
hope for is that when we interview a group and find ourselves
thinking "they seem like good founders, but what are investors going
to think of this crazy idea?" we'll continue to be able to say "who
cares what investors think?"  That's what we thought about Airbnb,
and if we want to fund more Airbnbs we have to stay good at thinking
it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I'm not saying that the big winners are all that matters, just
that they're all that matters financially for investors.  Since
we're not doing YC mainly for financial reasons, the big winners
aren't all that matters to us.  We're delighted to have funded
Reddit, for example. Even though we made comparatively little from
it, Reddit has had a big effect on the world, and it introduced us
to Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, both of whom have become good
friends.<br><br>Nor do we push founders to try to become one of the big winners if
they don't want to. We didn't "swing for the fences" in our own
startup (Viaweb, which was acquired for $50 million), and it would
feel pretty bogus to press founders to do something we didn't do.
Our rule is that it's up to the founders.  Some want to take over
the world, and some just want that first few million.  But we invest
in so many companies that we don't have to sweat any one outcome.
In fact, we don't have to sweat whether startups have exits at all.
The biggest exits are the only ones that matter financially, and
those are guaranteed in the sense that if a company becomes big
enough, a market for its shares will inevitably arise.  Since the
remaining outcomes don't have a significant effect on returns, it's
cool with us if the founders want to sell early for a small amount,
or grow slowly and never sell (i.e. become a so-called lifestyle
business), or even shut the company down.  We're sometimes disappointed
when a startup we had high hopes for doesn't do well, but this
disappointment is mostly the ordinary variety that anyone feels
when that happens.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Without visual cues (e.g. the horizon) you can't distinguish
between gravity and acceleration.  Which means if you're flying
through clouds you can't tell what the attitude of
the aircraft is.  You could feel like you're flying straight and
level while in fact you're descending in a spiral.  The solution
is to ignore what your body is telling you and listen only to your
instruments.  But it turns out to be very hard to ignore what your
body is telling you.  Every pilot knows about this 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation">problem</a> and yet
it is still a leading cause of accidents.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Not all big hits follow this pattern though. The reason Google
seemed a bad idea was that there were already lots of search engines
and there didn't seem to be room for another.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
A startup's success at fundraising is a function of two things:
what they're selling and how good they are at selling it.  And while
we can teach startups a lot about how to appeal to investors, even
the most convincing pitch can't sell an idea that investors don't
like.  I was genuinely worried that Airbnb, for example, would not
be able to raise money after Demo Day.  I couldn't convince <a href="airbnb.html">Fred Wilson</a> to fund them.  They might not
have raised money at all but for the coincidence that Greg McAdoo,
our contact at Sequoia, was one of a handful of VCs who understood
the vacation rental business, having spent much of the previous two
years investigating it.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
I calculated it once for the last batch before a consortium of
investors started offering investment automatically to every startup
we funded, summer 2010.  At the time it was 94% (33 of 35 companies
that tried to raise money succeeded, and one didn't try because
they were already profitable).  Presumably it's lower now because
of that investment; in the old days it was raise after Demo Day or
die.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, Jessica

<p>
September 2012<br><br>A startup is a company designed to grow fast.  Being newly founded
does not in itself make a company a startup.  Nor is it necessary
for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or
have some sort of "exit."  The only essential thing is growth.
Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.<br><br>If you want to start one it's important to understand that. Startups
are so hard that you can't be pointed off to the side and hope to
succeed.  You have to know that growth is what you're after.  The
good news is, if you get growth, everything else tends to fall into
place.  Which means you can use growth like a compass to make almost
every decision you face.<br><br>
<b>Redwoods</b><br><br>Let's start with a distinction that should be obvious but is often
overlooked: not every newly founded company is a startup.  Millions
of companies are started every year in the US.  Only a tiny fraction
are startups.  Most are service businesses — restaurants, barbershops,
plumbers, and so on.  These are not startups, except in a few unusual
cases.  A barbershop isn't designed to grow fast.  Whereas a search
engine, for example, is.<br><br>When I say startups are designed to grow fast, I mean it in two
senses.  Partly I mean designed in the sense of intended, because
most startups fail.  But I also mean startups are different by
nature, in the same way a redwood seedling has a different destiny
from a bean sprout.<br><br>That difference is why there's a distinct word, "startup," for
companies designed to grow fast.  If all companies were essentially
similar, but some through luck or the efforts of their founders
ended up growing very fast, we wouldn't need a separate word.  We
could just talk about super-successful companies and less successful
ones.  But in fact startups do have a different sort of DNA from
other businesses.  Google is not just a barbershop whose founders
were unusually lucky and hard-working.  Google was different from
the beginning.<br><br>To grow rapidly, you need to make something you can sell to a big
market.  That's the difference between Google and a barbershop.  A
barbershop doesn't scale.<br><br>For a company to grow really big, it must (a) make something lots
of people want, and (b) reach and serve all those people.  Barbershops
are doing fine in the (a) department.  Almost everyone needs their
hair cut.  The problem for a barbershop, as for any retail
establishment, is (b).  A barbershop serves customers in person,
and few will travel far for a haircut.  And even if they did, the
barbershop couldn't accomodate them. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Writing software is a great way to solve (b), but you can still end
up constrained in (a).  If you write software to teach Tibetan to
Hungarian speakers, you'll be able to reach most of the people who
want it, but there won't be many of them.   If you make software
to teach English to Chinese speakers, however, you're in startup
territory.<br><br>Most businesses are tightly constrained in (a) or (b).  The distinctive
feature of successful startups is that they're not.<br><br>
<b>Ideas</b><br><br>It might seem that it would always be better to start a startup
than an ordinary business.  If you're going to start a company, why
not start the type with the most potential?  The catch is that this
is a (fairly) efficient market.   If you write software to teach
Tibetan to Hungarians, you won't have much competition.  If you
write software to teach English to Chinese speakers, you'll face
ferocious competition, precisely because that's such a larger prize.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The constraints that limit ordinary companies also protect them.
That's the tradeoff.  If you start a barbershop, you only have to
compete with other local barbers.  If you start a search engine you
have to compete with the whole world.<br><br>The most important thing that the constraints on a normal business
protect it from is not competition, however, but the difficulty of
coming up with new ideas.  If you open a bar in a particular
neighborhood, as well as limiting your potential and protecting you
from competitors, that geographic constraint also helps define your
company.  Bar + neighborhood is a sufficient idea for a small
business.  Similarly for companies constrained in (a).  Your niche
both protects and defines you.<br><br>Whereas if you want to start a startup, you're probably going to
have to think of something fairly novel.  A startup has to make
something it can deliver to a large market, and ideas of that type
are so valuable that all the obvious ones are already taken.<br><br>That space of ideas has been so thoroughly picked over that a startup
generally has to work on something everyone else has overlooked.
I was going to write that one has to make a conscious effort to
find ideas everyone else has overlooked.  But that's not how most
startups get started.  Usually successful startups happen because
the founders are sufficiently different from other people that ideas
few others can see seem obvious to them.  Perhaps later they step
back and notice they've found an idea in everyone else's blind spot,
and from that point make a deliberate effort to stay there. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
But at the moment when successful startups get started, much of the
innovation is unconscious.<br><br>What's different about successful founders is that they can see
different problems.  It's a particularly good combination both to
be good at technology and to face problems that can be solved by
it, because technology changes so rapidly that formerly bad ideas
often become good without anyone noticing.  Steve Wozniak's problem
was that he wanted his own computer.  That was an unusual problem
to have in 1975.  But technological change was about to make it a
much more common one.  Because he not only wanted a computer but
knew how to build them, Wozniak was able to make himself one.  And
the problem he solved for himself became one that Apple solved for
millions of people in the coming years.  But by the time it was
obvious to ordinary people that this was a big market, Apple was
already established.<br><br>Google has similar origins.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted to
search the web.  But unlike most people they had the technical
expertise both to notice that existing search engines were not as
good as they could be, and to know how to improve them.  Over the
next few years their problem became everyone's problem, as the web
grew to a size where you didn't have to be a picky search expert
to notice the old algorithms weren't good enough.  But as happened
with Apple, by the time everyone else realized how important search
was, Google was entrenched.<br><br>That's one connection between startup ideas and technology.  Rapid
change in one area uncovers big, soluble problems in other areas.
Sometimes the changes are advances, and what they change is solubility.
That was the kind of change that yielded Apple; advances in chip
technology finally let Steve Wozniak design a computer he could
afford.  But in Google's case the most important change was the
growth of the web. What changed there was not solubility but bigness.<br><br>The other connection between startups and technology is that startups
create new ways of doing things, and new ways of doing things are,
in the broader sense of the word, new technology.  
When a startup both begins with an
idea exposed by technological change and makes a product consisting
of technology in the narrower sense (what used to be called "high
technology"), it's easy to conflate the two.  But the two connections
are distinct and in principle one could start a startup that was
neither driven by technological change, nor whose product consisted
of technology except in the broader sense. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Rate</b><br><br>How fast does a company have to grow to be considered a startup?
There's no precise answer to that.  "Startup" is a pole, not a
threshold.  Starting one is at first no more than a declaration of
one's ambitions.  You're committing not just to starting a company,
but to starting a fast growing one, and you're thus committing to
search for one of the rare ideas of that type.  But at first you
have no more than commitment.  Starting a startup is like being an
actor in that respect.  "Actor" too is a pole rather than a threshold.
At the beginning of his career, an actor is a waiter who goes to
auditions.  Getting work makes him a successful actor, but he doesn't
only become an actor when he's successful.<br><br>So the real question is not what growth rate makes a company a
startup, but what growth rate successful startups tend to have.
For founders that's more than a theoretical question, because it's
equivalent to asking if they're on the right path.<br><br>The growth of a successful startup usually has three phases:
</p><ol>
<li> There's an initial period of slow or no growth while the startup
  tries to figure out what it's doing.<br><br></li><li> As the startup figures out how to make something lots of people
  want and how to reach those people, there's a period of rapid
  growth.<br><br></li><li> Eventually a successful startup will grow into a big company.
  Growth will slow, partly due to internal limits and partly because
  the company is starting to bump up against the limits of the
  markets it serves.  
  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
</li></ol>
Together these three phases produce an S-curve.  The phase whose
growth defines the startup is the second one, the ascent.  Its
length and slope determine how big the company will be.<br><br>The slope is the company's growth rate.  If there's one number every
founder should always know, it's the company's growth rate.  That's
the measure of a startup.  If you don't know that number, you don't
even know if you're doing well or badly.<br><br>When I first meet founders and ask what their growth rate is,
sometimes they tell me "we get about a hundred new customers a
month."  That's not a rate.  What matters is not the absolute number
of new customers, but the ratio of new customers to existing ones.
If you're really getting a constant number of new customers every
month, you're in trouble, because that means your growth rate is
decreasing.<br><br>During Y Combinator we measure growth rate per week, partly because
there is so little time before Demo Day, and partly because startups
early on need frequent feedback from their users to tweak what
they're doing. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>A good growth rate during YC is 5-7% a week.  If you can hit 10% a
week you're doing exceptionally well.  If you can only manage 1%,
it's a sign you haven't yet figured out what you're doing.<br><br>The best thing to measure the growth rate of is revenue.  The next
best, for startups that aren't charging initially, is active users.
That's a reasonable proxy for revenue growth because whenever the
startup does start trying to make money, their revenues will probably
be a constant multiple of active users. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Compass</b><br><br>We usually advise startups to pick a growth rate they think they
can hit, and then just try to hit it every week.  The key word here
is "just." If they decide to grow at 7% a week and they hit that
number, they're successful for that week.  There's nothing more
they need to do.  But if they don't hit it, they've failed in the
only thing that mattered, and should be correspondingly alarmed.<br><br>Programmers will recognize what we're doing here.  We're turning
starting a startup into an optimization problem.  And anyone who
has tried optimizing code knows how wonderfully effective that sort
of narrow focus can be.  Optimizing code means taking an existing
program and changing it to use less of something, usually time or
memory.  You don't have to think about what the program should do,
just make it faster.  For most programmers this is very satisfying
work.  The narrow focus makes it a sort of puzzle, and you're
generally surprised how fast you can solve it.<br><br>Focusing on hitting a growth rate reduces the otherwise bewilderingly
multifarious problem of starting a startup to a single problem.
You can use that target growth rate to make all your decisions for
you; anything that gets you the growth you need is ipso facto right.
Should you spend two days at a conference?  Should you hire another
programmer?  Should you focus more on marketing?  Should you spend
time courting some big customer?  Should you add x feature? Whatever
gets you your target growth rate. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>Judging yourself by weekly growth doesn't mean you can look no more
than a week ahead.  Once you experience the pain of missing your
target one week (it was the only thing that mattered, and you failed
at it), you become interested in anything that could spare you such
pain in the future.  So you'll be willing for example to hire another
programmer, who won't contribute to this week's growth but perhaps
in a month will have implemented some new feature that will get you
more users.   But only if (a) the distraction of hiring someone
won't make you miss your numbers in the short term, and (b) you're
sufficiently worried about whether you can keep hitting your numbers
without hiring someone new.<br><br>It's not that you don't think about the future, just that you think
about it no more than necessary.<br><br>In theory this sort of hill-climbing could get a startup into
trouble.  They could end up on a local maximum.  But in practice
that never happens.  Having to hit a growth number every week forces
founders to act, and acting versus not acting is the high bit of
succeeding.  Nine times out of ten, sitting around strategizing is
just a form of procrastination.  Whereas founders' intuitions about
which hill to climb are usually better than they realize.  Plus the
maxima in the space of startup ideas are not spiky and isolated.
Most fairly good ideas are adjacent to even better ones.<br><br>The fascinating thing about optimizing for growth is that it can
actually discover startup ideas.  You can use the need for growth
as a form of evolutionary pressure.  If you start out with some
initial plan and modify it as necessary to keep hitting, say, 10%
weekly growth, you may end up with a quite different company than
you meant to start.  But anything that grows consistently at 10% a
week is almost certainly a better idea than you started with.<br><br>There's a parallel here to small businesses.  Just as the constraint
of being located in a particular neighborhood helps define a bar,
the constraint of growing at a certain rate can help define a
startup.<br><br>You'll generally do best to follow that constraint wherever it leads
rather than being influenced by some initial vision, just as a
scientist is better off following the truth wherever it leads rather
than being influenced by what he wishes were the case.  When Richard
Feynman said that the imagination of nature was greater than the
imagination of man, he meant that if you just keep following the
truth you'll discover cooler things than you could ever have made
up. For startups, growth is a constraint much like truth. Every
successful startup is at least partly a product of the imagination
of growth.

<b>Value</b><br><br>It's hard to find something that grows consistently at several
percent a week, but if you do you may have found something surprisingly
valuable.  If we project forward we see why.<br><br><center>

A company that grows at 1% a week will grow 1.7x a year, whereas a
company that grows at 5% a week will grow 12.6x.  A company making
$1000 a month (a typical number early in YC) and growing at 1% a
week will 4 years later be making $7900 a month, which is less than
a good programmer makes in salary in Silicon Valley.  A startup
that grows at 5% a week will in 4 years be making $25 million a
month. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>Our ancestors must rarely have encountered cases of exponential
growth, because our intuitions are no guide here.  What happens
to fast growing startups tends to surprise even the founders.<br><br>Small variations in growth rate produce qualitatively different
outcomes.  That's why there's a separate word for startups, and why
startups do things that ordinary companies don't, like raising money
and getting acquired.  And, strangely enough, it's also why they
fail so frequently.<br><br>Considering how valuable a successful startup can become, anyone
familiar with the concept of expected value would be surprised if
the failure rate weren't high.  If a successful startup could make
a founder $100 million, then even if the chance of succeeding were
only 1%, the expected value of starting one would be $1 million.
And the probability of a group of sufficiently smart and determined
founders succeeding on that scale might be significantly over 1%.
For the right people — e.g. the young Bill Gates — the probability
might be 20% or even 50%.  So it's not surprising that so many want
to take a shot at it.  In an efficient market, the number of failed
startups should be proportionate to the size of the successes.  And
since the latter is huge the former should be too. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>What this means is that at any given time, the great majority of
startups will be working on something that's never going to go
anywhere, and yet glorifying their doomed efforts with the grandiose
title of "startup."<br><br>This doesn't bother me.  It's the same with other high-beta vocations,
like being an actor or a novelist.  I've long since gotten used to
it.  But it seems to bother a lot of people, particularly those
who've started ordinary businesses.  Many are annoyed that these
so-called startups get all the attention, when hardly any of them
will amount to anything.<br><br>If they stepped back and looked at the whole picture they might be
less indignant.  The mistake they're making is that by basing their
opinions on anecdotal evidence they're implicitly judging by the
median rather than the average.  If you judge by the median startup,
the whole concept of a startup seems like a fraud.  You have to
invent a bubble to explain why founders want to start them or
investors want to fund them.  But it's a mistake to use the median
in a domain with so much variation.  If you look at the average
outcome rather than the median, you can understand why investors
like them, and why, if they aren't median people, it's a rational
choice for founders to start them.<br><br>
<b>Deals</b><br><br>Why do investors like startups so much?  Why are they so hot to
invest in photo-sharing apps, rather than solid money-making
businesses?  Not only for the obvious reason.<br><br>The test of any investment is the ratio of return to risk.  Startups
pass that test because although they're appallingly risky, the
returns when they do succeed are so high.  But that's not the only
reason investors like startups.  An ordinary slower-growing business
might have just as good a ratio of return to risk, if both were
lower.  So why are VCs interested only in high-growth companies?
The reason is that they get paid by getting their capital back,
ideally after the startup IPOs, or failing that when it's acquired.<br><br>The other way to get returns from an investment is in the form of
dividends.  Why isn't there a parallel VC industry that invests in
ordinary companies in return for a percentage of their profits?
Because it's too easy for people who control a private company to
funnel its revenues to themselves (e.g. by buying overpriced
components from a supplier they control) while making it look like
the company is making little profit.  Anyone who invested in private
companies in return for dividends would have to pay close attention
to their books.<br><br>The reason VCs like to invest in startups is not simply the returns,
but also because such investments are so easy to oversee.  The
founders can't enrich themselves without also enriching the investors.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>Why do founders want to take the VCs' money?  Growth, again.  The
constraint between good ideas and growth operates in both directions.
It's not merely that you need a scalable idea to grow.  If you have
such an idea and don't grow fast enough, competitors will.  Growing
too slowly is particularly dangerous in a business with network
effects, which the best startups usually have to some degree.<br><br>Almost every company needs some amount of funding to get started.
But startups often raise money even when they are or could be
profitable.  It might seem foolish to sell stock in a profitable
company for less than you think it will later be worth, but it's
no more foolish than buying insurance.  Fundamentally that's how
the most successful startups view fundraising.  They could grow the
company on its own revenues, but the extra money and help supplied
by VCs will let them grow even faster.  Raising money lets you
<i>choose</i> your growth rate.<br><br>Money to grow faster is always at the command of the most successful
startups, because the VCs need them more than they need the VCs.
A profitable startup could if it wanted just grow on its own revenues.
Growing slower might be slightly dangerous, but chances are it
wouldn't kill them.  Whereas VCs need to invest in startups, and
in particular the most successful startups, or they'll be out of
business.  Which means that any sufficiently promising startup will
be offered money on terms they'd be crazy to refuse.  And yet because
of the scale of the successes in the startup business, VCs can still
make money from such investments.  You'd have to be crazy to believe
your company was going to become as valuable as a high growth rate
can make it, but some do.<br><br>Pretty much every successful startup will get acquisition offers
too.  Why?  What is it about startups that makes other companies
want to buy them? 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>Fundamentally the same thing that makes everyone else want the stock
of successful startups: a rapidly growing company is valuable.  It's
a good thing eBay bought Paypal, for example, because Paypal is now
responsible for 43% of their sales and probably more of their growth.<br><br>But acquirers have an additional reason to want startups.  A rapidly
growing company is not merely valuable, but dangerous.  If it keeps
expanding, it might expand into the acquirer's own territory.  Most
product acquisitions have some component of fear.  Even if an
acquirer isn't threatened by the startup itself, they might be
alarmed at the thought of what a competitor could do with it.  And
because startups are in this sense doubly valuable to acquirers,
acquirers will often pay more than an ordinary investor would. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#999999">14</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Understand</b><br><br>The combination of founders, investors, and acquirers forms a natural
ecosystem.  It works so well that those who don't understand it are
driven to invent conspiracy theories to explain how neatly things
sometimes turn out.  Just as our ancestors did to explain the
apparently too neat workings of the natural world.  But there is
no secret cabal making it all work.<br><br>If you start from the mistaken assumption that Instagram was
worthless, you have to invent a secret boss to force Mark Zuckerberg
to buy it.  To anyone who knows Mark Zuckerberg, that is the reductio
ad absurdum of the initial assumption.  The reason he bought Instagram
was that it was valuable and dangerous, and what made it so was
growth.<br><br>If you want to understand startups, understand growth.  Growth
drives everything in this world.  Growth is why startups usually
work on technology — because ideas for fast growing companies are
so rare that the best way to find new ones is to discover those
recently made viable by change, and technology is the best source
of rapid change.  Growth is why it's a rational choice economically
for so many founders to try starting a startup: growth makes the
successful companies so valuable that the expected value is high
even though the risk is too.  Growth is why VCs want to invest in
startups: not just because the returns are high but also because
generating returns from capital gains is easier to manage than
generating returns from dividends.  Growth explains why the most
successful startups take VC money even if they don't need to: it
lets them choose their growth rate.  And growth explains why
successful startups almost invariably get acquisition offers.  To
acquirers a fast-growing company is not merely valuable but dangerous
too.<br><br>It's not just that if you want to succeed in some domain, you have
to understand the forces driving it.  Understanding growth is what
starting a startup <i>consists</i> of.  What you're really doing (and
to the dismay of some observers, all you're really doing) when you
start a startup is committing to solve a harder type of problem
than ordinary businesses do.  You're committing to search for one
of the rare ideas that generates rapid growth.  Because these ideas
are so valuable, finding one is hard.  The startup is the embodiment
of your discoveries so far.  Starting a startup is thus very much
like deciding to be a research scientist: you're not committing to
solve any specific problem; you don't know for sure which problems
are soluble; but you're committing to try to discover something no
one knew before.  A startup founder is in effect an economic research
scientist.  Most don't discover anything that remarkable, but some
discover relativity.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Strictly speaking it's not lots of customers you need but a big
market, meaning a high product of number of customers times how
much they'll pay.  But it's dangerous to have too few customers
even if they pay a lot, or the power that individual customers have
over you could turn you into a de facto consulting firm.  So whatever
market you're in, you'll usually do best to err on the side of
making the broadest type of product for it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
One year at Startup School David Heinemeier Hansson encouraged
programmers who wanted to start businesses to use a restaurant as
a model.  What he meant, I believe, is that it's fine to start
software companies constrained in (a) in the same way a restaurant
is constrained in (b).  I agree.  Most people should not try to
start startups.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
That sort of stepping back is one of the things we focus on at
Y Combinator.  It's common for founders to have discovered something
intuitively without understanding all its implications.  That's
probably true of the biggest discoveries in any field.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
I got it wrong in <a href="wealth.html">"How to Make Wealth"</a> when I said that a
startup was a small company that takes on a hard technical
problem.  That is the most common recipe but not the only one.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
In principle companies aren't limited by the size of the markets
they serve, because they could just expand into new markets.  But
there seem to be limits on the ability of big companies to do that.
Which means the slowdown that comes from bumping up against the
limits of one's markets is ultimately just another way in which
internal limits are expressed.<br><br>It may be that some of these limits could be overcome by changing
the shape of the organization — specifically by sharding it.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
This is, obviously, only for startups that have already launched
or can launch during YC.  A startup building a new database will
probably not do that.  On the other hand, launching something small
and then using growth rate as evolutionary pressure is such a
valuable technique that any company that could start this way
probably should.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
If the startup is taking the Facebook/Twitter route and building
something they hope will be very popular but from which they don't
yet have a definite plan to make money, the growth rate has to be
higher, even though it's a proxy for revenue growth, because such
companies need huge numbers of users to succeed at all.<br><br>Beware too of the edge case where something spreads rapidly but the
churn is high as well, so that you have good net growth till you run
through all the potential users, at which point it suddenly stops.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Within YC when we say it's ipso facto right to do whatever gets
you growth, it's implicit that this excludes trickery like buying
users for more than their lifetime value, counting users as active
when they're really not, bleeding out invites at a regularly
increasing rate to manufacture a perfect growth curve, etc.  Even
if you were able to fool investors with such tricks, you'd ultimately
be hurting yourself, because you're throwing off your own compass.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Which is why it's such a dangerous mistake to believe that
successful startups are simply the embodiment of some brilliant
initial idea.  What you're looking for initially is not so much a
great idea as an idea that could evolve into a great one.   The
danger is that promising ideas are not merely blurry versions of
great ones.  They're often different in kind, because the early
adopters you evolve the idea upon have different needs from the
rest of the market.  For example, the idea that evolves into Facebook
isn't merely a subset of Facebook; the idea that evolves into
Facebook is a site for Harvard undergrads.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
What if a company grew at 1.7x a year for a really long time?
Could it not grow just as big as any successful startup?  In principle
yes, of course. If our hypothetical company making $1000 a month
grew at 1% a week for 19 years, it would grow as big as a company
growing at 5% a week for 4 years.  But while such trajectories may
be common in, say, real estate development, you don't see them much
in the technology business.  In technology, companies that grow
slowly tend not to grow as big.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
Any expected value calculation varies from person to person
depending on their utility function for money.  I.e. the first
million is worth more to most people than subsequent millions.  How
much more depends on the person.  For founders who are younger or
more ambitious the utility function is flatter.  Which is probably
part of the reason the founders of the most successful startups of
all tend to be on the young side.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
More precisely, this is the case in the biggest winners, which
is where all the returns come from.  A startup founder could pull
the same trick of enriching himself at the company's expense by
selling them overpriced components.  But it wouldn't be worth it
for the founders of Google to do that.  Only founders of failing
startups would even be tempted, but those are writeoffs from the
VCs' point of view anyway.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
Acquisitions fall into two categories: those where the acquirer
wants the business, and those where the acquirer just wants the
employees.  The latter type is sometimes called an HR acquisition.
Though nominally acquisitions and sometimes on a scale that has a
significant effect on the expected value calculation for potential
founders, HR acquisitions are viewed by acquirers as more akin to
hiring bonuses.<br><br>[<a name="f14n"><font color="#000000">14</font></a>]
I once explained this to some founders who had recently arrived
from Russia.  They found it novel that if you threatened a company
they'd pay a premium for you.  "In Russia they just kill you," they
said, and they were only partly joking.  Economically, the fact
that established companies can't simply eliminate new competitors
may be one of the most valuable aspects of the rule of law.  And
so to the extent we see incumbents suppressing competitors via
regulations or patent suits, we should worry, not because it's a
departure from the rule of law per se but from what the rule of law
is aiming at.<br><br>

October 2012<br><br>One advantage of Y Combinator's early, broad focus is that we
see trends before most other people.  And one of the most conspicuous
trends in the last batch was the large number of hardware startups.
Out of 84 companies, 7 were making hardware.  On the whole
they've done better than the companies that weren't.<br><br>They've faced resistance from investors of course.  Investors have
a deep-seated bias against hardware.  But investors' opinions are
a trailing indicator.  The best founders are better at seeing the
future than the best investors, because the best founders are making
it.<br><br>There is no one single force driving this trend.  Hardware <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/pebble-smartwatch-tops-out-at-10-million-on-kickstarter/">does
well</a> on crowdfunding sites.  The spread of <a href="http://paulgraham.com/tablets.html">tablets</a> makes it
possible to build new things <a href="http://lockitron.com">controlled
by</a> and even <a href="http://doublerobotics.com">incorporating</a>
them.  <a href="http://www.boostedboards.com/">Electric motors</a>
 have improved.
Wireless connectivity of various types can now be taken for granted.
It's getting more straightforward to get things manufactured.
Arduinos, 3D printing, laser cutters, and more accessible CNC milling are making hardware easier to prototype.
Retailers are less of a bottleneck as customers increasingly buy
online.<br><br>One question I can answer is why hardware is suddenly cool.
It always was cool.
Physical things are great.  They just haven't
been as great a way to start a <a href="growth.html">rapidly growing</a> business
as software.  But that rule may not be permanent.  It's not even
that old; it only dates from about 1990.  Maybe the advantage
of software will turn out to have been temporary.  Hackers love to
build hardware, and customers love to buy it.  So if the ease of
shipping hardware even approached the ease of shipping software,
we'd see a lot more hardware startups.<br><br>It wouldn't be the first time something was a bad idea till it
wasn't.  And it wouldn't be the first time investors learned that
lesson from founders.<br><br>So if you want to work on hardware, don't be deterred from doing
it because you worry investors will discriminate against you.  And
in particular, don't be deterred from <a href="http://ycombinator.com/apply.html">applying</a> to Y Combinator
with a hardware idea, because we're especially interested in hardware
startups.<br><br>We know there's room for the <a href="ambitious.html">next Steve Jobs</a>.
But there's almost certainly also room for the first

<p>
November 2012<br><br>The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup
ideas.  It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have
yourself.<br><br>The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common:
they're something the founders themselves want, that they themselves
can build, and that few others realize are worth doing.  Microsoft,
Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began this way.<br><br>
<b>Problems</b><br><br>Why is it so important to work on a problem you have?  Among other
things, it ensures the problem really exists.  It sounds obvious
to say you should only work on problems that exist.  And yet by far
the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one
has.<br><br>I made it myself.  In 1995 I started a company to put art galleries
online.  But galleries didn't want to be online.  It's not how the
art business works.  So why did I spend 6 months working on this
stupid idea?  Because I didn't pay attention to users.  I invented
a model of the world that didn't correspond to reality, and worked
from that.  I didn't notice my model was wrong until I tried
to convince users to pay for what we'd built.  Even then I took
embarrassingly long to catch on.  I was attached to my model of the
world, and I'd spent a lot of time on the software.  They had to
want it!<br><br>Why do so many founders build things no one wants?  Because they
begin by trying to think of startup ideas.  That m.o. is doubly
dangerous: it doesn't merely yield few good ideas; it yields bad
ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them.<br><br>At YC we call these "made-up" or "sitcom" startup ideas.  Imagine
one of the characters on a TV show was starting a startup.  The
writers would have to invent something for it to do.  But coming
up with good startup ideas is hard.  It's not something you can do
for the asking.  So (unless they got amazingly lucky) the writers
would come up with an idea that sounded plausible, but was actually
bad.<br><br>For example, a social network for pet owners.  It doesn't sound
obviously mistaken.  Millions of people have pets.  Often they care
a lot about their pets and spend a lot of money on them.  Surely
many of these people would like a site where they could talk to
other pet owners.  Not all of them perhaps, but if just 2 or 3
percent were regular visitors, you could have millions of users.
You could serve them targeted offers, and maybe charge for premium
features. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by your
friends with pets, they don't say "I would <i>never</i> use this." They
say "Yeah, maybe I could see using something like that." Even when
the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people.
They don't want to use it themselves, at least not right now, but
they could imagine other people wanting it.  Sum that reaction
across the entire population, and you have zero users. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Well</b><br><br>When a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who
really need what they're making — not just people who could see
themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently.  Usually
this initial group of users is small, for the simple reason that
if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed
and that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usually
puts into a version one, it would probably already exist.  Which
means you have to compromise on one dimension: you can either build
something a large number of people want a small amount, or something
a small number of people want a large amount.  Choose the latter.
Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all
good startup ideas are of that type.<br><br>Imagine a graph whose x axis represents all the people who might
want what you're making and whose y axis represents how much they
want it.  If you invert the scale on the y axis, you can envision
companies as holes.  Google is an immense crater: hundreds of
millions of people use it, and they need it a lot.  A startup just
starting out can't expect to excavate that much volume.  So you
have two choices about the shape of hole you start with.  You can
either dig a hole that's broad but shallow, or one that's narrow
and deep, like a well.<br><br>Made-up startup ideas are usually of the first type.  Lots of people
are mildly interested in a social network for pet owners.<br><br>Nearly all good startup ideas are of the second type.  Microsoft
was a well when they made Altair Basic.  There were only a couple
thousand Altair owners, but without this software they were programming
in machine language.  Thirty years later Facebook had the same
shape.  Their first site was exclusively for Harvard students, of
which there are only a few thousand, but those few thousand users
wanted it a lot.<br><br>When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this
right now?  Who wants this so much that they'll use it even when
it's a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they've never
heard of?  If you can't answer that, the idea is probably bad. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>You don't need the narrowness of the well per se.  It's depth you
need; you get narrowness as a byproduct of optimizing for depth
(and speed).  But you almost always do get it.  In practice the
link between depth and narrowness is so strong that it's a good
sign when you know that an idea will appeal strongly to a specific
group or type of user.<br><br>But while demand shaped like a well is almost a necessary condition
for a good startup idea, it's not a sufficient one.  If Mark
Zuckerberg had built something that could only ever have appealed
to Harvard students, it would not have been a good startup idea.
Facebook was a good idea because it started with a small market
there was a fast path out of.  Colleges are similar enough that if
you build a facebook that works at Harvard, it will work at any
college. So you spread rapidly through all the colleges.  Once you
have all the college students, you get everyone else simply by
letting them in.<br><br>Similarly for Microsoft: Basic for the Altair; Basic for other
machines; other languages besides Basic; operating systems;
applications; IPO.<br><br>
<b>Self</b><br><br>How do you tell whether there's a path out of an idea?  How do you
tell whether something is the germ of a giant company, or just a
niche product?  Often you can't. The founders of Airbnb didn't
realize at first how big a market they were tapping.  Initially
they had a much narrower idea.  They were going to let hosts rent
out space on their floors during conventions.  They didn't foresee
the expansion of this idea; it forced itself upon them gradually.
All they knew at first is that they were onto something.  That's
probably as much as Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg knew at first.<br><br>Occasionally it's obvious from the beginning when there's a path
out of the initial niche.  And sometimes I can see a path that's
not immediately obvious; that's one of our specialties at YC.  But
there are limits to how well this can be done, no matter how much
experience you have.  The most important thing to understand about
paths out of the initial idea is the meta-fact that these are hard
to see.<br><br>So if you can't predict whether there's a path out of an idea, how
do you choose between ideas?  The truth is disappointing but
interesting: if you're the right sort of person, you have the right
sort of hunches.  If you're at the leading edge of a field that's
changing fast, when you have a hunch that something is worth doing,
you're more likely to be right.<br><br>In <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>, Robert Pirsig says:
</p><blockquote>
  You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It's easy.  Make
  yourself perfect and then just paint naturally.
</blockquote>
I've wondered about that passage since I read it in high school.
I'm not sure how useful his advice is for painting specifically,
but it fits this situation well.  Empirically, the way to have good
startup ideas is to become the sort of person who has them.<br><br>Being at the leading edge of a field doesn't mean you have to be
one of the people pushing it forward.  You can also be at the leading
edge as a user.  It was not so much because he was a programmer
that Facebook seemed a good idea to Mark Zuckerberg as because he
used computers so much.  If you'd asked most 40 year olds in 2004
whether they'd like to publish their lives semi-publicly on the
Internet, they'd have been horrified at the idea.  But Mark already
lived online; to him it seemed natural.<br><br>Paul Buchheit says that people at the leading edge of a rapidly
changing field "live in the future."  Combine that with Pirsig and
you get:
<blockquote>
  Live in the future, then build what's missing.
</blockquote>
That describes the way many if not most of the biggest startups got
started.  Neither Apple nor Yahoo nor Google nor Facebook were even
supposed to be companies at first.  They grew out of things their
founders built because there seemed a gap in the world.<br><br>If you look at the way successful founders have had their ideas,
it's generally the result of some external stimulus hitting a
prepared mind.  Bill Gates and Paul Allen hear about the Altair and
think "I bet we could write a Basic interpreter for it." Drew Houston
realizes he's forgotten his USB stick and thinks "I really need to
make my files live online." Lots of people heard about the Altair.
Lots forgot USB sticks.  The reason those stimuli caused those
founders to start companies was that their experiences had prepared
them to notice the opportunities they represented.<br><br>The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not
"think up" but "notice." At YC we call ideas that grow naturally
out of the founders' own experiences "organic" startup ideas.  The
most successful startups almost all begin this way.<br><br>That may not have been what you wanted to hear.  You may have
expected recipes for coming up with startup ideas, and instead I'm
telling you that the key is to have a mind that's prepared in the
right way.  But disappointing though it may be, this is the truth.
And it is a recipe of a sort, just one that in the worst case takes
a year rather than a weekend.<br><br>If you're not at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field,
you can get to one.  For example, anyone reasonably smart can
probably get to an edge of programming (e.g. building mobile apps)
in a year.  Since a successful startup will consume at least 3-5
years of your life, a year's preparation would be a reasonable
investment.  Especially if you're also looking for a cofounder.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>You don't have to learn programming to be at the leading edge of a
domain that's changing fast.  Other domains change fast.  But while
learning to hack is not necessary, it is for the forseeable future
sufficient. As Marc Andreessen put it, software is eating the world,
and this trend has decades left to run.<br><br>Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you'll be
able to implement them.  That's not absolutely necessary (Jeff Bezos
couldn't) but it's an advantage.  It's a big advantage, when you're
considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if
instead of merely thinking "That's an interesting idea," you can
think instead "That's an interesting idea.  I'll try building an
initial version tonight."  It's even better when you're both a
programmer and the target user, because then the cycle of generating
new versions and testing them on users can happen inside one head.<br><br>
<b>Noticing</b><br><br>Once you're living in the future in some respect, the way to notice
startup ideas is to look for things that seem to be missing.  If
you're really at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field, there
will be things that are obviously missing.  What won't be obvious
is that they're startup ideas.  So if you want to find startup
ideas, don't merely turn on the filter "What's missing?" Also turn
off every other filter, particularly "Could this be a big company?"
There's plenty of time to apply that test later.  But if you're
thinking about that initially, it may not only filter out lots
of good ideas, but also cause you to focus on bad ones.<br><br>Most things that are missing will take some time to see.  You almost
have to trick yourself into seeing the ideas around you.<br><br>But you <i>know</i> the ideas are out there.  This is not one of those
problems where there might not be an answer.  It's impossibly
unlikely that this is the exact moment when technological progress
stops.  You can be sure people are going to build things in the
next few years that will make you think "What did I do before x?"<br><br>And when these problems get solved, they will probably seem flamingly
obvious in retrospect.  What you need to do is turn off the filters
that usually prevent you from seeing them.  The most powerful is
simply taking the current state of the world for granted.  Even the
most radically open-minded of us mostly do that.  You couldn't get
from your bed to the front door if you stopped to question everything.<br><br>But if you're looking for startup ideas you can sacrifice some of
the efficiency of taking the status quo for granted and start to
question things.  Why is your inbox overflowing?  Because you get
a lot of email, or because it's hard to get email out of your inbox?
Why do you get so much email?  What problems are people trying to
solve by sending you email?  Are there better ways to solve them?
And why is it hard to get emails out of your inbox?  Why do you
keep emails around after you've read them?  Is an inbox the optimal
tool for that?<br><br>Pay particular attention to things that chafe you.  The advantage
of taking the status quo for granted is not just that it makes life
(locally) more efficient, but also that it makes life more tolerable.
If you knew about all the things we'll get in the next 50 years but
don't have yet, you'd find present day life pretty constraining,
just as someone from the present would if they were sent back 50
years in a time machine.  When something annoys you, it could be
because you're living in the future.<br><br>When you find the right sort of problem, you should probably be
able to describe it as <i>obvious</i>, at least to you.  When we started
Viaweb, all the online stores were built by hand, by web designers
making individual HTML pages.  It was obvious to us as programmers
that these sites would have to be generated by software.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Which means, strangely enough, that coming up with startup ideas
is a question of seeing the obvious.  That suggests how weird this
process is: you're trying to see things that are obvious, and yet
that you hadn't seen.<br><br>Since what you need to do here is loosen up your own mind, it may
be best not to make too much of a direct frontal attack on the
problem — i.e. to sit down and try to think of ideas.  The best
plan may be just to keep a background process running, looking for
things that seem to be missing.  Work on hard problems, driven
mainly by curiosity, but have a second self watching over your
shoulder, taking note of gaps and anomalies.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Give yourself some time.  You have a lot of control over the rate
at which you turn yours into a prepared mind, but you have less
control over the stimuli that spark ideas when they hit it.  If
Bill Gates and Paul Allen had constrained themselves to come up
with a startup idea in one month, what if they'd chosen a month
before the Altair appeared?  They probably would have worked on a
less promising idea.  Drew Houston did work on a less promising
idea before Dropbox: an SAT prep startup.  But Dropbox was a much
better idea, both in the absolute sense and also as a match for his
skills.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>A good way to trick yourself into noticing ideas is to work on
projects that seem like they'd be cool.  If you do that, you'll
naturally tend to build things that are missing.  It wouldn't seem
as interesting to build something that already existed.<br><br>Just as trying to think up startup ideas tends to produce bad ones,
working on things that could be dismissed as "toys" often produces
good ones.  When something is described as a toy, that means it has
everything an idea needs except being important.  It's cool; users
love it; it just doesn't matter.  But if you're living in the future
and you build something cool that users love, it may matter more
than outsiders think.  Microcomputers seemed like toys when Apple
and Microsoft started working on them.  I'm old enough to remember
that era; the usual term for people with their own microcomputers
was "hobbyists."  BackRub seemed like an inconsequential science
project.  The Facebook was just a way for undergrads to stalk one
another.<br><br>At YC we're excited when we meet startups working on things that
we could imagine know-it-alls on forums dismissing as toys.  To us
that's positive evidence an idea is good.<br><br>If you can afford to take a long view (and arguably you can't afford
not to), you can turn "Live in the future and build what's missing"
into something even better:
<blockquote>
  Live in the future and build what seems interesting.
</blockquote><br><br>
<b>School</b><br><br>That's what I'd advise college students to do, rather than trying
to learn about "entrepreneurship."  "Entrepreneurship" is something
you learn best by doing it.  The examples of the most successful
founders make that clear.  What you should be spending your time
on in college is ratcheting yourself into the future.  College is
an incomparable opportunity to do that.  What a waste to sacrifice
an opportunity to solve the hard part of starting a startup — becoming 
the sort of person who can have organic startup ideas — by 
spending time learning about the easy part.  Especially since
you won't even really learn about it, any more than you'd learn
about sex in a class.  All you'll learn is the words for things.<br><br>The clash of domains is a particularly fruitful source of ideas.
If you know a lot about programming and you start learning about
some other field, you'll probably see problems that software could
solve.  In fact, you're doubly likely to find good problems in
another domain: (a) the inhabitants of that domain are not as likely
as software people to have already solved their problems with
software, and (b) since you come into the new domain totally ignorant,
you don't even know what the status quo is to take it for granted.<br><br>So if you're a CS major and you want to start a startup, instead
of taking a class on entrepreneurship you're better off taking a
class on, say, genetics.  Or better still, go work for a biotech
company.  CS majors normally get summer jobs at computer hardware
or software companies.  But if you want to find startup ideas, you
might do better to get a summer job in some unrelated field. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>Or don't take any extra classes, and just build things.  It's no
coincidence that Microsoft and Facebook both got started in January.
At Harvard that is (or was) Reading Period, when students have no
classes to attend because they're supposed to be studying for finals.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>But don't feel like you have to build things that will become startups.  That's
premature optimization. Just build things.  Preferably with other
students.  It's not just the classes that make a university such a
good place to crank oneself into the future.  You're also surrounded
by other people trying to do the same thing.  If you work together
with them on projects, you'll end up producing not just organic
ideas, but organic ideas with organic founding teams — and that,
empirically, is the best combination.<br><br>Beware of research.  If an undergrad writes something all his friends
start using, it's quite likely to represent a good startup idea.
Whereas a PhD dissertation is extremely unlikely to.  For some
reason, the more a project has to count as research, the less likely
it is to be something that could be turned into a startup.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font>
I think the reason is that the subset of ideas that count as research
is so narrow that it's unlikely that a project that satisfied that
constraint would also satisfy the orthogonal constraint of solving
users' problems.  Whereas when students (or professors) build
something as a side-project, they automatically gravitate toward
solving users' problems — perhaps even with an additional energy
that comes from being freed from the constraints of research.<br><br>
<b>Competition</b><br><br>Because a good idea should seem obvious, when you have one you'll
tend to feel that you're late.  Don't let that deter you.  Worrying
that you're late is one of the signs of a good idea.  Ten minutes
of searching the web will usually settle the question.  Even if you
find someone else working on the same thing, you're probably not
too late.  It's exceptionally rare for startups to be killed by
competitors — so rare that you can almost discount the possibility.
So unless you discover a competitor with the sort of lock-in that
would prevent users from choosing you, don't discard the idea.<br><br>If you're uncertain, ask users.  The question of whether you're too
late is subsumed by the question of whether anyone urgently needs
what you plan to make.  If you have something that no competitor
does and that some subset of users urgently need, you have a
beachhead.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>The question then is whether that beachhead is big enough. Or more
importantly, who's in it: if the beachhead consists of people doing
something lots more people will be doing in the future, then it's
probably big enough no matter how small it is.  For example, if
you're building something differentiated from competitors by the
fact that it works on phones, but it only works on the newest phones,
that's probably a big enough beachhead.<br><br>Err on the side of doing things where you'll face competitors.
Inexperienced founders usually give competitors more credit than
they deserve.  Whether you succeed depends far more on you than on
your competitors.  So better a good idea with competitors than a
bad one without.<br><br>You don't need to worry about entering a "crowded market" so long
as you have a thesis about what everyone else in it is overlooking.
In fact that's a very promising starting point.  Google was that
type of idea.  Your thesis has to be more precise than "we're going
to make an x that doesn't suck" though. You have to be able to
phrase it in terms of something the incumbents are overlooking.
Best of all is when you can say that they didn't have the courage
of their convictions, and that your plan is what they'd have done
if they'd followed through on their own insights.  Google was that
type of idea too.  The search engines that preceded them shied away
from the most radical implications of what they were doing — particularly 
that the better a job they did, the faster users would
leave.<br><br>A crowded market is actually a good sign, because it means both
that there's demand and that none of the existing solutions are
good enough.  A startup can't hope to enter a market that's obviously
big and yet in which they have no competitors.  So any startup that
succeeds is either going to be entering a market with existing
competitors, but armed with some secret weapon that will get them
all the users (like Google), or entering a market that looks small
but which will turn out to be big (like Microsoft).  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Filters</b><br><br>There are two more filters you'll need to turn off if you want to
notice startup ideas: the unsexy filter and the schlep filter.<br><br>Most programmers wish they could start a startup by just writing
some brilliant code, pushing it to a server, and having users pay
them lots of money.  They'd prefer not to deal with tedious problems
or get involved in messy ways with the real world.  Which is a
reasonable preference, because such things slow you down.  But this
preference is so widespread that the space of convenient startup
ideas has been stripped pretty clean.  If you let your mind wander
a few blocks down the street to the messy, tedious ideas, you'll
find valuable ones just sitting there waiting to be implemented.<br><br>The schlep filter is so dangerous that I wrote a separate essay
about the condition it induces, which I called 
<a href="schlep.html">schlep blindness</a>.
I gave Stripe as an example of a startup that benefited from turning
off this filter, and a pretty striking example it is.  Thousands
of programmers were in a position to see this idea; thousands of
programmers knew how painful it was to process payments before
Stripe.  But when they looked for startup ideas they didn't see
this one, because unconsciously they shrank from having to deal
with payments.  And dealing with payments is a schlep for Stripe,
but not an intolerable one.  In fact they might have had net less
pain; because the fear of dealing with payments kept most people
away from this idea, Stripe has had comparatively smooth sailing
in other areas that are sometimes painful, like user acquisition.
They didn't have to try very hard to make themselves heard by users,
because users were desperately waiting for what they were building.<br><br>The unsexy filter is similar to the schlep filter, except it keeps
you from working on problems you despise rather than ones you fear.
We overcame this one to work on Viaweb. There were interesting
things about the architecture of our software, but we weren't
interested in ecommerce per se.  We could see the problem was one
that needed to be solved though.<br><br>Turning off the schlep filter is more important than turning off
the unsexy filter, because the schlep filter is more likely to be
an illusion.  And even to the degree it isn't, it's a worse form
of self-indulgence.  Starting a successful startup is going to be
fairly laborious no matter what.  Even if the product doesn't entail
a lot of schleps, you'll still have plenty dealing with investors,
hiring and firing people, and so on.  So if there's some idea you
think would be cool but you're kept away from by fear of the schleps
involved, don't worry: any sufficiently good idea will have as many.<br><br>The unsexy filter, while still a source of error, is not as entirely
useless as the schlep filter.  If you're at the leading edge of a
field that's changing rapidly, your ideas about what's sexy will
be somewhat correlated with what's valuable in practice.  Particularly
as you get older and more experienced.  Plus if you find an idea
sexy, you'll work on it more enthusiastically. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Recipes</b><br><br>While the best way to discover startup ideas is to become the sort
of person who has them and then build whatever interests you,
sometimes you don't have that luxury.  Sometimes you need an idea
now.  For example, if you're working on a startup and your initial
idea turns out to be bad.<br><br>For the rest of this essay I'll talk about tricks for coming up
with startup ideas on demand.  Although empirically you're better
off using the organic strategy, you could succeed this way. You
just have to be more disciplined.  When you use the organic method,
you don't even notice an idea unless it's evidence that something
is truly missing.  But when you make a conscious effort to think
of startup ideas, you have to replace this natural constraint with
self-discipline.  You'll see a lot more ideas, most of them bad,
so you need to be able to filter them.<br><br>One of the biggest dangers of not using the organic method is the
example of the organic method.  Organic ideas feel like inspirations.
There are a lot of stories about successful startups that began
when the founders had what seemed a crazy idea but "just knew" it
was promising.  When you feel that about an idea you've had while
trying to come up with startup ideas, you're probably mistaken.<br><br>When searching for ideas, look in areas where you have some expertise.
If you're a database expert, don't build a chat app for teenagers
(unless you're also a teenager).  Maybe it's a good idea, but you
can't trust your judgment about that, so ignore it.  There have to
be other ideas that involve databases, and whose quality you can
judge.  Do you find it hard to come up with good ideas involving
databases?  That's because your expertise raises your standards.
Your ideas about chat apps are just as bad, but you're giving
yourself a Dunning-Kruger pass in that domain.<br><br>The place to start looking for ideas is things you need.  There
<i>must</i> be things you need.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#999999">14</font></a>]</font><br><br>One good trick is to ask yourself whether in your previous job you
ever found yourself saying "Why doesn't someone make x?  If someone
made x we'd buy it in a second." If you can think of any x people
said that about, you probably have an idea.  You know there's demand,
and people don't say that about things that are impossible to build.<br><br>More generally, try asking yourself whether there's something unusual
about you that makes your needs different from most other people's.
You're probably not the only one.  It's especially good if you're
different in a way people will increasingly be.<br><br>If you're changing ideas, one unusual thing about you is the idea
you'd previously been working on.  Did you discover any needs while
working on it?  Several well-known startups began this way.  Hotmail
began as something its founders wrote to talk about their previous
startup idea while they were working at their day jobs. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#999999">15</font></a>]</font><br><br>A particularly promising way to be unusual is to be young.  Some
of the most valuable new ideas take root first among people in their
teens and early twenties.  And while young founders are at a
disadvantage in some respects, they're the only ones who really
understand their peers.  It would have been very hard for someone
who wasn't a college student to start Facebook.  So if you're a
young founder (under 23 say), are there things you and your friends
would like to do that current technology won't let you?<br><br>The next best thing to an unmet need of your own is an unmet need
of someone else.  Try talking to everyone you can about the gaps
they find in the world.  What's missing?  What would they like to
do that they can't?  What's tedious or annoying, particularly in
their work?  Let the conversation get general; don't be trying too
hard to find startup ideas.  You're just looking for something to
spark a thought.  Maybe you'll notice a problem they didn't consciously
realize they had, because you know how to solve it.<br><br>When you find an unmet need that isn't your own, it may be somewhat
blurry at first.  The person who needs something may not know exactly
what they need.  In that case I often recommend that founders act
like consultants — that they do what they'd do if they'd been
retained to solve the problems of this one user.  People's problems
are similar enough that nearly all the code you write this way will
be reusable, and whatever isn't will be a small price to start out
certain that you've reached the bottom of the well.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#999999">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>One way to ensure you do a good job solving other people's problems
is to make them your own.  When Rajat Suri of E la Carte decided
to write software for restaurants, he got a job as a waiter to learn
how restaurants worked.  That may seem like taking things to extremes,
but startups are extreme.  We love it when founders do such things.<br><br>In fact, one strategy I recommend to people who need a new idea is
not merely to turn off their schlep and unsexy filters, but to seek
out ideas that are unsexy or involve schleps.  Don't try to start
Twitter.  Those ideas are so rare that you can't find them by looking
for them.  Make something unsexy that people will pay you for.<br><br>A good trick for bypassing the schlep and to some extent the unsexy
filter is to ask what you wish someone else would build, so that
you could use it.  What would you pay for right now?<br><br>Since startups often garbage-collect broken companies and industries,
it can be a good trick to look for those that are dying, or deserve
to, and try to imagine what kind of company would profit from their
demise.  For example, journalism is in free fall at the moment.
But there may still be money to be made from something like journalism.
What sort of company might cause people in the future to say "this
replaced journalism" on some axis?<br><br>But imagine asking that in the future, not now.  When one company
or industry replaces another, it usually comes in from the side.
So don't look for a replacement for x; look for something that
people will later say turned out to be a replacement for x.  And
be imaginative about the axis along which the replacement occurs.
Traditional journalism, for example, is a way for readers to get
information and to kill time, a way for writers to make money and
to get attention, and a vehicle for several different types of
advertising.  It could be replaced on any of these axes (it has
already started to be on most).<br><br>When startups consume incumbents, they usually start by serving
some small but important market that the big players ignore.  It's
particularly good if there's an admixture of disdain in the big
players' attitude, because that often misleads them.  For example,
after Steve Wozniak built the computer that became the Apple I, he
felt obliged to give his then-employer Hewlett-Packard the option
to produce it.  Fortunately for him, they turned it down, and one
of the reasons they did was that it used a TV for a monitor, which
seemed intolerably d�class� to a high-end hardware company like HP
was at the time. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f17n"><font color="#999999">17</font></a>]</font><br><br>Are there groups of 
<a href="marginal.html">scruffy</a> 
but sophisticated users like the early
microcomputer "hobbyists" that are currently being ignored by the
big players?  A startup with its sights set on bigger things can
often capture a small market easily by expending an effort that
wouldn't be justified by that market alone.<br><br>Similarly, since the most successful startups generally ride some
wave bigger than themselves, it could be a good trick to look for
waves and ask how one could benefit from them.  The prices of gene
sequencing and 3D printing are both experiencing Moore's Law-like
declines.  What new things will we be able to do in the new world
we'll have in a few years?  What are we unconsciously ruling out
as impossible that will soon be possible?<br><br>
<b>Organic</b><br><br>But talking about looking explicitly for waves makes it clear that
such recipes are plan B for getting startup ideas.  Looking for
waves is essentially a way to simulate the organic method.  If
you're at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you don't
have to look for waves; you are the wave.<br><br>Finding startup ideas is a subtle business, and that's why most
people who try fail so miserably.  It doesn't work well simply to
try to think of startup ideas.  If you do that, you get bad ones
that sound dangerously plausible.  The best approach is more indirect:
if you have the right sort of background, good startup ideas will
seem obvious to you.  But even then, not immediately.  It takes
time to come across situations where you notice something missing.
And often these gaps won't seem to be ideas for companies, just
things that would be interesting to build.  Which is why it's good
to have the time and the inclination to build things just because
they're interesting.<br><br>Live in the future and build what seems interesting.  Strange as
it sounds, that's the real recipe.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This form of bad idea has been around as long as the web.  It
was common in the 1990s, except then people who had it used to say
they were going to create a portal for x instead of a social network
for x.  Structurally the idea is stone soup: you post a sign saying
"this is the place for people interested in x," and all those people
show up and you make money from them.  What lures founders into
this sort of idea are statistics about the millions of people who
might be interested in each type of x.  What they forget is that
any given person might have 20 affinities by this standard, and no
one is going to visit 20 different communities regularly.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
I'm not saying, incidentally, that I know for sure a social
network for pet owners is a bad idea.  I know it's a bad idea the
way I know randomly generated DNA would not produce a viable organism.
The set of plausible sounding startup ideas is many times larger
than the set of good ones, and many of the good ones don't even
sound that plausible.  So if all you know about a startup idea is
that it sounds plausible, you have to assume it's bad.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
More precisely, the users' need has to give them sufficient
activation energy to start using whatever you make, which can vary
a lot.  For example, the activation energy for enterprise software
sold through traditional channels is very high, so you'd have to
be a <i>lot</i> better to get users to switch.  Whereas the activation
energy required to switch to a new search engine is low.  Which in
turn is why search engines are so much better than enterprise
software.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
This gets harder as you get older.  While the space of ideas
doesn't have dangerous local maxima, the space of careers does.
There are fairly high walls between most of the paths people take
through life, and the older you get, the higher the walls become.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
It was also obvious to us that the web was going to be a big
deal.  Few non-programmers grasped that in 1995, but the programmers
had seen what GUIs had done for desktop computers.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Maybe it would work to have this second self keep a journal,
and each night to make a brief entry listing the gaps and anomalies
you'd noticed that day.  Not startup ideas, just the raw gaps and
anomalies.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Sam Altman points out that taking time to come up with an
idea is not merely a better strategy in an absolute sense, but also
like an undervalued stock in that so few founders do it.<br><br>There's comparatively little competition for the best ideas, because
few founders are willing to put in the time required to notice them.
Whereas there is a great deal of competition for mediocre ideas,
because when people make up startup ideas, they tend to make up the
same ones.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
For the computer hardware and software companies, summer jobs
are the first phase of the recruiting funnel.  But if you're good
you can skip the first phase.  If you're good you'll have no trouble
getting hired by these companies when you graduate, regardless of
how you spent your summers.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
The empirical evidence suggests that if colleges want to help
their students start startups, the best thing they can do is leave
them alone in the right way.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
I'm speaking here of IT startups; in biotech things are different.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
This is an instance of a more general rule: focus on users,
not competitors.  The most important information about competitors
is what you learn via users anyway.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
In practice most successful startups have elements of both.
And you can describe each strategy in terms of the other by adjusting
the boundaries of what you call the market.  But it's useful to
consider these two ideas separately.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
I almost hesitate to raise that point though.  Startups are
businesses; the point of a business is to make money; and with that
additional constraint, you can't expect you'll be able to spend all
your time working on what interests you most.<br><br>[<a name="f14n"><font color="#000000">14</font></a>]
The need has to be a strong one.  You can retroactively
describe any made-up idea as something you need.  But do you really
need that recipe site or local event aggregator as much as Drew
Houston needed Dropbox, or Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia needed Airbnb?<br><br>Quite often at YC I find myself asking founders "Would you use this
thing yourself, if you hadn't written it?" and you'd be surprised
how often the answer is no.<br><br>[<a name="f15n"><font color="#000000">15</font></a>]
Paul Buchheit points out that trying to sell something bad
can be a source of better ideas:<br><br>"The best technique I've found for dealing with YC companies that
have bad ideas is to tell them to go sell the product ASAP (before
wasting time building it). Not only do they learn that nobody
wants what they are building, they very often come back with a
real idea that they discovered in the process of trying to sell
the bad idea."<br><br>[<a name="f16n"><font color="#000000">16</font></a>]
Here's a recipe that might produce the next Facebook, if
you're college students.  If you have a connection to one of the
more powerful sororities at your school, approach the queen bees
thereof and offer to be their personal IT consultants, building
anything they could imagine needing in their social lives that
didn't already exist.  Anything that got built this way would be
very promising, because such users are not just the most demanding
but also the perfect point to spread from.<br><br>I have no idea whether this would work.<br><br>[<a name="f17n"><font color="#000000">17</font></a>]
And the reason it used a TV for a monitor is that Steve Wozniak
started out by solving his own problems.  He, like most of his
peers, couldn't afford a monitor.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Mike Arrington, Paul Buchheit, John Collison,

batch, which has 53.  The total valuation of the 287 that have
valuations (either by raising an equity round, getting acquired,
or dying) is about $11.7 billion, and the 511 prior to the current
batch have collectively raised about $1.7 billion.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>As usual those numbers are dominated by a few big winners.  The top
10 startups account for 8.6 of that 11.7 billion.  But there is a
peloton of younger startups behind them.  There are about 40 more
that have a shot at being really big.<br><br>Things got a little out of hand last summer when we had 84 companies
in the batch, so we tightened up our filter to decrease the batch
size. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Several journalists have tried to interpret that as
evidence for some macro story they were telling, but the reason had
nothing to do with any external trend.  The reason was that we
discovered we were using an n² algorithm, and we needed to buy
time to fix it.  Fortunately we've come up with several techniques
for sharding YC, and the problem now seems to be fixed.  With a new
more scaleable model and only 53 companies, the current batch feels
like a walk in the park.  I'd guess we can grow another 2 or 3x
before hitting the next bottleneck. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>One consequence of funding such a large number of startups is that
we see trends early.  And since fundraising is one of the main
things we help startups with, we're in a good position to notice
trends in investing.<br><br>I'm going to take a shot at describing where these trends are
leading.  Let's start with the most basic question: will the future
be better or worse than the past?  Will investors, in the aggregate,
make more money or less?<br><br>I think more.  There are multiple forces at work, some of which
will decrease returns, and some of which will increase them.  I
can't predict for sure which forces will prevail, but I'll describe
them and you can decide for yourself.<br><br>There are two big forces driving change in startup funding: it's
becoming cheaper to start a startup, and startups are becoming a
more normal thing to do.<br><br>When I graduated from college in 1986, there were essentially two
options: get a job or go to grad school.  Now there's a third: start
your own company.
That's a big change.  In principle it was possible to start your
own company in 1986 too, but it didn't seem like a real possibility.
It seemed possible to start a consulting company, or a niche product
company, but it didn't seem possible to start a company that would
become big.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>That kind of change, from 2 paths to 3, is the sort of big social
shift that only happens once every few generations.  I think we're
still at the beginning of this one.  It's hard to predict how big
a deal it will be.  As big a deal as the Industrial Revolution?
Maybe.  Probably not.  But it will be a big enough deal that it
takes almost everyone by surprise, because those big social shifts
always do.<br><br>One thing we can say for sure is that there will be a lot more
startups.  The monolithic, hierarchical companies of the mid 20th
century are being <a href="highres.html">replaced</a> by networks
of smaller companies.  This process is not just something happening
now in Silicon Valley.  It started decades ago, and it's happening
as far afield as the car industry.  It has a long way to run. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>
The other big driver of change is that startups are becoming cheaper
to start.  And in fact the two forces are related: the decreasing
cost of starting a startup is one of the reasons startups are
becoming a more normal thing to do.<br><br>The fact that startups need less money means founders will increasingly
have the upper hand over investors.  You still need just as much
of their energy and imagination, but they don't need as much of
your money.  Because founders have the upper hand, they'll retain
an increasingly large share of the stock in, and <a href="control.html">control of</a>, their
companies.  Which means investors will get less stock and less
control.<br><br>Does that mean investors will make less money?  Not necessarily,
because there will be more good startups.  The total amount of
desirable startup stock available to investors will probably increase,
because the number of desirable startups will probably grow faster
than the percentage they sell to investors shrinks.<br><br>There's a rule of thumb in the VC business that there are about 15
companies a year that will be really successful.  Although a lot
of investors unconsciously treat this number as if it were some
sort of cosmological constant, I'm certain it isn't.   There are
probably limits on the rate at which technology can develop, but
that's not the limiting factor now.  If it were, each successful
startup would be founded the month it became possible, and that is
not the case. Right now the limiting factor on the number of big
hits is the number of sufficiently good founders starting companies,
and that number can and will increase.  There are still a lot of
people who'd make great founders who never end up starting a company.
You can see that from how randomly some of the most successful
startups got started.  So many of the biggest startups almost didn't
happen that there must be a lot of equally good startups that
actually didn't happen.<br><br>There might be 10x or even 50x more good founders out there.  As
more of them go ahead and start startups, those 15 big hits a year
could easily become 50 or even 100.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>What about returns, though?  Are we heading for a world in which
returns will be pinched by increasingly high valuations?  I think
the top firms will actually make more money than they have in the
past.  High returns don't come from investing at low valuations.
They come from investing in the companies that do really well.  So
if there are more of those to be had each year, the best pickers
should have more hits.<br><br>This means there should be more variability in the VC business.
The firms that can recognize and attract the best startups will do
even better, because there will be more of them to recognize and
attract.  Whereas the bad firms will get the leftovers, as they do
now, and yet pay a higher price for them.<br><br>Nor do I think it will be a problem that founders keep control of
their companies for longer.  The empirical evidence on that is
already clear: investors make more money as founders' bitches than
their bosses.  Though somewhat humiliating, this is actually good
news for investors, because it takes less time to serve founders
than to micromanage them.<br><br>What about angels?  I think there is a lot of opportunity there.
It used to suck to be an angel investor.  You couldn't get access
to the best deals, unless you got lucky like Andy Bechtolsheim, and
when you did invest in a startup, VCs might try to strip you of
your stock when they arrived later.  Now an angel can go to something
like Demo Day or AngelList and have access to the same deals VCs
do.  And the days when VCs could wash angels out of the cap table
are long gone.<br><br>I think one of the biggest unexploited opportunities in startup
investing right now is angel-sized investments made quickly.  Few
investors understand the cost that raising money from them imposes
on startups.  When the company consists only of the founders,
everything grinds to a halt during fundraising, which can easily
take 6 weeks.  The current high cost of fundraising means there is
room for low-cost investors to undercut the rest.  And in this
context, low-cost means deciding quickly.  If there were a reputable
investor who invested $100k on good terms and promised to decide
yes or no within 24 hours, they'd get access to almost all the best
deals, because every good startup would approach them first.  It
would be up to them to pick, because every bad startup would approach
them first too, but at least they'd see everything.  Whereas if an
investor is notorious for taking a long time to make up their mind
or negotiating a lot about valuation, founders will save them for
last.  And in the case of the most promising startups, which tend
to have an easy time raising money, last can easily become never.<br><br>Will the number of big hits grow linearly with the total number of
new startups?  Probably not, for two reasons.  One is that the
scariness of starting a startup in the old days was a pretty effective
filter.  Now that the cost of failing is becoming lower, we should
expect founders to do it more.  That's not a bad thing.  It's common
in technology for an innovation that decreases the cost of failure
to increase the number of failures and yet leave you net ahead.<br><br>The other reason the number of big hits won't grow proportionately
to the number of startups is that there will start to be an increasing
number of idea clashes.  Although the finiteness of the number of
good ideas is not the reason there are only 15 big hits a year, the
number has to be finite, and the more startups there are, the more
we'll see multiple companies doing the same thing at the same time.
It will be interesting, in a bad way, if idea clashes become a lot
more common. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Mostly because of the increasing number of early failures, the startup
business of the future won't simply be the same shape, scaled up.
What used to be an obelisk will become a pyramid.  It will be a
little wider at the top, but a lot wider at the bottom.<br><br>What does that mean for investors?  One thing it means is that there
will be more opportunities for investors at the earliest stage,
because that's where the volume of our imaginary solid is growing
fastest.  Imagine the obelisk of investors that corresponds to
the obelisk of startups.  As it widens out into a pyramid to match
the startup pyramid, all the contents are adhering to the top,
leaving a vacuum at the bottom.<br><br>That opportunity for investors mostly means an opportunity for new
investors, because the degree of risk an existing investor or firm
is comfortable taking is one of the hardest things for them to
change.  Different types of investors are adapted to different
degrees of risk, but each has its specific degree of risk deeply
imprinted on it, not just in the procedures they follow but in the
personalities of the people who work there.<br><br>I think the biggest danger for VCs, and also the biggest opportunity,
is at the series A stage.  Or rather, what used to be the series A
stage before series As turned into de facto series B rounds.<br><br>Right now, VCs often knowingly invest too much money at the series
A stage.  They do it because they feel they need to get a big chunk
of each series A company to compensate for the opportunity cost of
the board seat it consumes.  Which means when there is a lot of
competition for a deal, the number that moves is the valuation (and
thus amount invested) rather than the percentage of the company
being sold.  Which means, especially in the case of more promising
startups, that series A investors often make companies take more
money than they want.<br><br>Some VCs lie and claim the company really needs that much.  Others
are more candid, and admit their financial models require them to
own a certain percentage of each company.  But we all know the
amounts being raised in series A rounds are not determined by asking
what would be best for the companies.  They're determined by VCs
starting from the amount of the company they want to own, and the
market setting the valuation and thus the amount invested.<br><br>Like a lot of bad things, this didn't happen intentionally.  The
VC business backed into it as their initial assumptions gradually
became obsolete.  The traditions and financial models of the VC
business were established when founders needed investors more.  In
those days it was natural for founders to sell VCs a big chunk of
their company in the series A round.  Now founders would prefer to
sell less, and VCs are digging in their heels because they're not
sure if they can make money buying less than 20% of each series A
company.<br><br>The reason I describe this as a danger is that series A investors
are increasingly at odds with the startups they supposedly serve,
and that tends to come back to bite you eventually.  The reason I
describe it as an opportunity is that there is now a lot of potential
energy built up, as the market has moved away from VCs' traditional
business model.  Which means the first VC to break ranks and start
to do series A rounds for as much equity as founders want to sell
(and with no "option pool" that comes only from the founders' shares)
stands to reap huge benefits.<br><br>What will happen to the VC business when that happens?  Hell if I
know.  But I bet that particular firm will end up ahead.  If one
top-tier VC firm started to do series A rounds that started from
the amount the company needed to raise and let the percentage
acquired vary with the market, instead of the other way around,
they'd instantly get almost all the best startups.  And that's where
the money is.<br><br>You can't fight market forces forever.  Over the last decade we've
seen the percentage of the company sold in series A rounds creep
inexorably downward.  40% used to be common.  Now VCs are fighting
to hold the line at 20%.  But I am daily waiting for the line to
collapse.  It's going to happen.  You may as well anticipate it,
and look bold.<br><br>Who knows, maybe VCs will make more money by doing the right thing.
It wouldn't be the first time that happened.  Venture capital is a
business where occasional big successes generate hundredfold returns.
How much confidence can you really have in financial models for
something like that anyway?  The
big successes only have to get a tiny bit less occasional to
compensate for a 2x decrease in the stock sold in series A rounds.<br><br>If you want to find new opportunities for investing, look for things
founders complain about.  Founders are your customers, and the
things they complain about are unsatisfied demand.  I've given two
examples of things founders complain about most—investors who
take too long to make up their minds, and excessive dilution in
series A rounds—so those are good places to look now.  But
the more general recipe is: do something founders want.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I realize revenue and not fundraising is the proper test of
success for a startup.  The reason we quote statistics about
fundraising is because those are the numbers we have.  We couldn't
talk meaningfully about revenues without including the numbers from
the most successful startups, and we don't have those.  We often
discuss revenue growth with the earlier stage startups, because
that's how we gauge their progress, but when companies reach a
certain size it gets presumptuous for a seed investor to do that.<br><br>In any case, companies' market caps do eventually become a function
of revenues, and post-money valuations of funding rounds are at
least guesses by pros about where those market caps will end up.<br><br>The reason only 287 have valuations is that the rest have mostly
raised money on convertible notes, and although convertible notes
often have valuation caps, a valuation cap is merely an upper bound
on a valuation.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
We didn't try to accept a particular number.  We have no way
of doing that even if we wanted to.  We just tried to be significantly
pickier.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Though you never know with bottlenecks, I'm guessing the next
one will be coordinating efforts among partners.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
I realize starting a company doesn't have to mean starting a
<a href="growth.html">startup</a>.  There will be lots of people starting normal companies
too.  But that's not relevant to an audience of investors.<br><br>Geoff Ralston reports that in Silicon Valley it seemed thinkable
to start a startup in the mid 1980s.  It would have started there.
But I know it didn't to undergraduates on the East Coast.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
This trend is one of the main causes of the increase in
economic inequality in the US since the mid twentieth century.  The
person who would in 1950 have been the general manager of the x
division of Megacorp is now the founder of the x company, and owns
significant equity in it.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
If Congress passes the <a href="foundervisa.html">founder
visa</a> in a non-broken form, that alone could in principle get
us up to 20x, since 95% of the world's population lives outside the
US.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
If idea clashes got bad enough, it could change what it means
to be a startup.  We currently advise startups mostly to ignore
competitors.  We tell them startups are competitive like running,
not like soccer; you don't have to go and steal the ball away from
the other team.  But if idea clashes became common enough, maybe
you'd start to have to.  That would be unfortunate.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Dalton Caldwell,

</font><p><font size="2" face="verdana">
July 2013<br><br>One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is
to do things that don't scale.  A lot of would-be founders believe
that startups either take off or don't.  You build something, make
it available, and if you've made a better mousetrap, people beat a
path to your door as promised.  Or they don't, in which case the
market must not exist.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off.
There may be a handful that just grew by themselves, but usually
it takes some sort of push to get them going.  A good metaphor would
be the cranks that car engines had before they got electric starters.
Once the engine was going, it would keep going, but there was a
separate and laborious process to get it going.<br><br><b>Recruit</b><br><br>The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start
is to recruit users manually.  Nearly all startups have to.  You
can't wait for users to come to you.  You have to go out and get
them.<br><br>Stripe is one of the most successful startups we've funded, and the
problem they solved was an urgent one.   If anyone could have sat
back and waited for users, it was Stripe.  But in fact they're
famous within YC for aggressive early user acquisition.<br><br>Startups building things for other startups have a big pool of
potential users in the other companies we've funded, and none took
better advantage of it than Stripe.  At YC we use the term "Collison
installation" for the technique they invented.  More diffident
founders ask "Will you try our beta?" and if the answer is yes,
they say "Great, we'll send you a link."  But the Collison brothers
weren't going to wait. When anyone agreed to try Stripe they'd say
"Right then, give me your laptop" and set them up on the spot.<br><br>There are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting users
individually.  One is a combination of shyness and laziness.  They'd
rather sit at home writing code than go out and talk to a bunch of
strangers and probably be rejected by most of them.  But for a
startup to succeed, at least one founder (usually the CEO) will
have to spend a lot of time on sales and marketing.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The other reason founders ignore this path is that the absolute
numbers seem so small at first.  This can't be how the big, famous
startups got started, they think. The mistake they make is to
underestimate the power of compound growth.  We encourage every
startup to measure their progress by weekly <a href="growth.html">growth
rate</a>.  If you have 100 users, you need to get 10 more next week
to grow 10% a week.  And while 110 may not seem much better than
100, if you keep growing at 10% a week you'll be surprised how big
the numbers get.  After a year you'll have 14,000 users, and after
2 years you'll have 2 million.<br><br>You'll be doing different things when you're acquiring users a
thousand at a time, and growth has to slow down eventually.  But
if the market exists you can usually start by recruiting users
manually and then gradually switch to less manual methods. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Airbnb is a classic example of this technique.  Marketplaces are
so hard to get rolling that you should expect to take heroic measures
at first. In Airbnb's case, these consisted of going door to door
in New York, recruiting new users and helping existing ones improve
their listings.  When I remember the Airbnbs during YC, I picture
them with rolly bags, because when they showed up for tuesday dinners
they'd always just flown back from somewhere.<br><br><b>Fragile</b><br><br>Airbnb now seems like an unstoppable juggernaut, but early on it
was so fragile that about 30 days of going out and engaging in
person with users made the difference between success and failure.<br><br>That initial fragility was not a unique feature of Airbnb.  Almost
all startups are fragile initially.  And that's one of the biggest
things inexperienced founders and investors (and reporters and
know-it-alls on forums) get wrong about them.  They unconsciously
judge larval startups by the standards of established ones.  They're
like someone looking at a newborn baby and concluding "there's no
way this tiny creature could ever accomplish anything."<br><br>It's harmless if reporters and know-it-alls dismiss your startup.
They always get things wrong.   It's even ok if investors dismiss
your startup; they'll change their minds when they see growth.  The
big danger is that you'll dismiss your startup yourself.  I've seen
it happen.  I often have to encourage founders who don't see the
full potential of what they're building.  Even Bill Gates made that
mistake.  He returned to Harvard for the fall semester after starting
Microsoft.  He didn't stay long, but he wouldn't have returned at
all if he'd realized Microsoft was going to be even a fraction of
the size it turned out to be. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>The question to ask about an early stage startup is not "is this
company taking over the world?"  but "how big could this company
get if the founders did the right things?"  And the right things
often seem both laborious and inconsequential at the time. Microsoft
can't have seemed very impressive when it was just a couple guys
in Albuquerque writing Basic interpreters for a market of a few
thousand hobbyists (as they were then called), but in retrospect
that was the optimal path to dominating microcomputer software.
And I know Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia didn't feel like they were
en route to the big time as they were taking "professional" photos
of their first hosts' apartments.  They were just trying to survive.
But in retrospect that too was the optimal path to dominating a big
market.<br><br>How do you find users to recruit manually?  If you build something
to solve <a href="startupideas.html">your own problems</a>, then
you only have to find your peers, which is usually straightforward.
Otherwise you'll have to make a more deliberate effort to locate
the most promising vein of users.  The usual way to do that is to
get some initial set of users by doing a comparatively untargeted
launch, and then to observe which kind seem most enthusiastic, and
seek out more like them.  For example, Ben Silbermann noticed that
a lot of the earliest Pinterest users were interested in design,
so he went to a conference of design bloggers to recruit users, and
that worked well. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Delight</b><br><br>You should take extraordinary measures not just to acquire users,
but also to make them happy.  For as long as they could (which
turned out to be surprisingly long), Wufoo sent each new user a
hand-written thank you note.  Your first users should feel that
signing up with you was one of the best choices they ever made.
And you in turn should be racking your brains to think of new ways
to delight them.<br><br>Why do we have to teach startups this?  Why is it counterintuitive
for founders?  Three reasons, I think.<br><br>One is that a lot of startup founders are trained as engineers,
and customer service is not part of the training of engineers.
You're supposed to build things that are robust and elegant, not
be slavishly attentive to individual users like some kind of
salesperson.  Ironically, part of the reason engineering is
traditionally averse to handholding is that its traditions date
from a time when engineers were less powerful — when they were
only in charge of their narrow domain of building things, rather
than running the whole show.  You can be ornery when you're Scotty,
but not when you're Kirk.<br><br>Another reason founders don't focus enough on individual customers
is that they worry it won't scale.  But when founders of larval
startups worry about this, I point out that in their current state
they have nothing to lose.  Maybe if they go out of their way to
make existing users super happy, they'll one day have too many to
do so much for.  That would be a great problem to have.  See if you
can make it happen.  And incidentally, when it does, you'll find
that delighting customers scales better than you expected.  Partly
because you can usually find ways to make anything scale more than
you would have predicted, and partly because delighting customers
will by then have permeated your culture.<br><br>I have never once seen a startup lured down a blind alley by trying
too hard to make their initial users happy.<br><br>But perhaps the biggest thing preventing founders from realizing
how attentive they could be to their users is that they've never
experienced such attention themselves.  Their standards for customer
service have been set by the companies they've been customers of,
which are mostly big ones.  Tim Cook doesn't send you a hand-written
note after you buy a laptop.  He can't.  But you can.  That's one
advantage of being small: you can provide a level of service no big
company can. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Once you realize that existing conventions are not the upper bound
on user experience, it's interesting in a very pleasant way to think
about how far you could go to delight your users.<br><br><b>Experience</b><br><br>I was trying to think of a phrase to convey how extreme your attention
to users should be, and I realized Steve Jobs had already done it:
insanely great.  Steve wasn't just using "insanely" as a synonym
for "very."  He meant it more literally — that one should focus
on quality of execution to a degree that in everyday life would be
considered pathological.<br><br>All the most successful startups we've funded have, and that probably
doesn't surprise would-be founders.  What novice founders don't get
is what insanely great translates to in a larval startup.  When
Steve Jobs started using that phrase, Apple was already an established
company.  He meant the Mac (and its documentation and even
packaging — such is the nature of obsession) should be insanely
well designed and manufactured.  That's not hard for engineers to
grasp.  It's just a more extreme version of designing a robust and
elegant product.<br><br>What founders have a hard time grasping (and Steve himself might
have had a hard time grasping) is what insanely great morphs into
as you roll the time slider back to the first couple months of a
startup's life.  It's not the product that should be insanely great,
but the experience of being your user.  The product is just one
component of that.  For a big company it's necessarily the dominant
one.  But you can and should give users an insanely great experience
with an early, incomplete, buggy product, if you make up the
difference with attentiveness.<br><br>Can, perhaps, but should?  Yes.  Over-engaging with early users is
not just a permissible technique for getting growth rolling.  For
most successful startups it's a necessary part of the feedback loop
that makes the product good.  Making a better mousetrap is not an
atomic operation.  Even if you start the way most successful startups
have, by building something you yourself need, the first thing you
build is never quite right.  And except in domains with big penalties
for making mistakes, it's often better not to aim for perfection
initially.  In software, especially, it usually works best to get
something in front of users as soon as it has a quantum of utility,
and then see what they do with it.  Perfectionism is often an excuse
for procrastination, and in any case your initial model of users
is always inaccurate, even if you're one of them. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>The feedback you get from engaging directly with your earliest users
will be the best you ever get.  When you're so big you have to
resort to focus groups, you'll wish you could go over to your users'
homes and offices and watch them use your stuff like you did when
there were only a handful of them.<br><br><b>Fire</b><br><br>Sometimes the right unscalable trick is to focus on a deliberately
narrow market.  It's like keeping a fire contained at first to get
it really hot before adding more logs.<br><br>That's what Facebook did.  At first it was just for Harvard students.
In that form it only had a potential market of a few thousand people,
but because they felt it was really for them, a critical mass of
them signed up.  After Facebook stopped being for Harvard students,
it remained for students at specific colleges for quite a while.
When I interviewed Mark Zuckerberg at Startup School, he said that
while it was a lot of work creating course lists for each school,
doing that made students feel the site was their natural home.<br><br>Any startup that could be described as a marketplace usually has
to start in a subset of the market, but this can work for other
startups as well.  It's always worth asking if there's a subset of
the market in which you can get a critical mass of users quickly.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>Most startups that use the contained fire strategy do it unconsciously.
They build something for themselves and their friends, who happen
to be the early adopters, and only realize later that they could
offer it to a broader market.  The strategy works just as well if
you do it unconsciously.  The biggest danger of not being consciously
aware of this pattern is for those who naively discard part of it.
E.g. if you don't build something for yourself and your friends,
or even if you do, but you come from the corporate world and your
friends are not early adopters, you'll no longer have a perfect
initial market handed to you on a platter.<br><br>Among companies, the best early adopters are usually other startups.
They're more open to new things both by nature and because, having
just been started, they haven't made all their choices yet.  Plus
when they succeed they grow fast, and you with them.  It was one
of many unforeseen advantages of the YC model (and specifically of
making YC big) that B2B startups now have an instant market of
hundreds of other startups ready at hand.<br><br><b>Meraki</b><br><br>For <a href="hw.html">hardware startups</a> there's a variant of
doing things that don't scale that we call "pulling a Meraki."
Although we didn't fund Meraki, the founders were Robert Morris's
grad students, so we know their history.  They got started by doing
something that really doesn't scale: assembling their routers
themselves.<br><br>Hardware startups face an obstacle that software startups don't.
The minimum order for a factory production run is usually several
hundred thousand dollars.  Which can put you in a catch-22: without
a product you can't generate the growth you need to raise the money
to manufacture your product.  Back when hardware startups had to
rely on investors for money, you had to be pretty convincing to
overcome this.  The arrival of crowdfunding (or more precisely,
preorders) has helped a lot.  But even so I'd advise startups to
pull a Meraki initially if they can.  That's what Pebble did.  The
Pebbles 
<a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/eric.jpg?t=1730199416&amp;">assembled</a>
 the first several hundred watches themselves. If
they hadn't gone through that phase, they probably wouldn't have
sold $10 million worth of watches when they did go on Kickstarter.<br><br>Like paying excessive attention to early customers, fabricating
things yourself turns out to be valuable for hardware startups.
You can tweak the design faster when you're the factory, and you
learn things you'd never have known otherwise.  Eric Migicovsky of
Pebble said one of the things he learned was "how valuable it was to
source good screws."   Who knew?<br><br><b>Consult</b><br><br>Sometimes we advise founders of B2B startups to take over-engagement
to an extreme, and to pick a single user and act as if they were
consultants building something just for that one user.   The initial
user serves as the form for your mold; keep tweaking till you fit
their needs perfectly, and you'll usually find you've made something
other users want too.  Even if there aren't many of them, there are
probably adjacent territories that have more.  As long as you can
find just one user who really needs something and can act on that
need, you've got a toehold in making something people want, and
that's as much as any startup needs initially. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>Consulting is the canonical example of work that doesn't scale.
But (like other ways of bestowing one's favors liberally) it's safe
to do it so long as you're not being paid to.  That's where companies
cross the line.  So long as you're a product company that's merely
being extra attentive to a customer, they're very grateful even if
you don't solve all their problems.  But when they start paying you
specifically for that attentiveness — when they start paying
you by the hour — they expect you to do everything.<br><br>Another consulting-like technique for recruiting initially lukewarm
users is to use your software yourselves on their behalf.  We
did that at Viaweb.  When we approached merchants asking if they
wanted to use our software to make online stores, some said no, but
they'd let us make one for them.  Since we would do anything to get
users, we did.  We felt pretty lame at the time.  Instead of
organizing big strategic e-commerce partnerships, we were trying
to sell luggage and pens and men's shirts.  But in retrospect it
was exactly the right thing to do, because it taught us how it would
feel to merchants to use our software.  Sometimes the feedback loop
was near instantaneous: in the middle of building some merchant's
site I'd find I needed a feature we didn't have, so I'd spend a
couple hours implementing it and then resume building the site.<br><br><b>Manual</b><br><br>There's a more extreme variant where you don't just use your software,
but are your software.  When you only have a small number of users,
you can sometimes get away with doing by hand things that you plan
to automate later.  This lets you launch faster, and when you do
finally automate yourself out of the loop, you'll know exactly what
to build because you'll have muscle memory from doing it yourself.<br><br>When manual components look to the user like software, this technique
starts to have aspects of a practical joke.  For example, the way
Stripe delivered "instant" merchant accounts to its first users was
that the founders manually signed them up for traditional merchant
accounts behind the scenes.<br><br>Some startups could be entirely manual at first. If you can find
someone with a problem that needs solving and you can solve it
manually, go ahead and do that for as long as you can, and then
gradually automate the bottlenecks.  It would be a little frightening
to be solving users' problems in a way that wasn't yet automatic,
but less frightening than the far more common case of having something
automatic that doesn't yet solve anyone's problems.<br><br><b>Big</b><br><br>I should mention one sort of initial tactic that usually doesn't
work: the Big Launch.  I occasionally meet founders who seem to
believe startups are projectiles rather than powered aircraft, and
that they'll make it big if and only if they're launched with
sufficient initial velocity.  They want to launch simultaneously
in 8 different publications, with embargoes.  And on a tuesday, of
course, since they read somewhere that's the optimum day to launch
something.<br><br>It's easy to see how little launches matter.  Think of some successful
startups.  How many of their launches do you remember?
All you need from a launch is some initial core of users.  How well
you're doing a few months later will depend more on how happy you
made those users than how many there were of them.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>So why do founders think launches matter?  A combination of solipsism
and laziness.  They think what they're building is so great that
everyone who hears about it will immediately sign up.  Plus it would
be so much less work if you could get users merely by broadcasting
your existence, rather than recruiting them one at a time.  But
even if what you're building really is great, getting users will
always be a gradual process — partly because great things
are usually also novel, but mainly because users have other things
to think about.<br><br>Partnerships too usually don't work.  They don't work for startups
in general, but they especially don't work as a way to get growth
started.  It's a common mistake among inexperienced founders to
believe that a partnership with a big company will be their big
break.  Six months later they're all saying the same thing: that
was way more work than we expected, and we ended up getting practically
nothing out of it. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>It's not enough just to do something extraordinary initially.  You
have to make an extraordinary <i>effort</i> initially.  Any strategy
that omits the effort — whether it's expecting a big launch to
get you users, or a big partner — is ipso facto suspect.<br><br><b>Vector</b><br><br>The need to do something unscalably laborious to get started is so
nearly universal that it might be a good idea to stop thinking of
startup ideas as scalars.  Instead we should try thinking of them
as pairs of what you're going to build, plus the unscalable thing(s)
you're going to do initially to get the company going.<br><br>It could be interesting to start viewing startup ideas this way,
because now that there are two components you can try to be imaginative
about the second as well as the first.  But in most cases the second
component will be what it usually is — recruit users manually
and give them an overwhelmingly good experience — and the main
benefit of treating startups as vectors will be to remind founders
they need to work hard in two dimensions.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>In the best case, both components of the vector contribute to your
company's DNA: the unscalable things you have to do to get started
are not merely a necessary evil, but change the company permanently
for the better.  If you have to be aggressive about user acquisition
when you're small, you'll probably still be aggressive when you're
big.  If you have to manufacture your own hardware, or use your
software on users's behalf, you'll learn things you couldn't have
learned otherwise.  And most importantly, if you have to work hard
to delight users when you only have a handful of them, you'll keep
doing it when you have a lot.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Actually Emerson never mentioned mousetraps specifically.  He
wrote "If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell,
or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs,
than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his
house, though it be in the woods."<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Thanks to Sam Altman for suggesting I make this explicit.
And no, you can't avoid doing sales by hiring someone to do it for
you.  You have to do sales yourself initially.  Later you can hire
a real salesperson to replace you.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The reason this works is that as you get bigger, your size
helps you grow.  Patrick Collison wrote "At some point, there was
a very noticeable change in how Stripe felt. It tipped from being
this boulder we had to push to being a train car that in fact had
its own momentum."<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
One of the more subtle ways in which YC can help founders
is by calibrating their ambitions, because we know exactly how a
lot of successful startups looked when they were just getting
started.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
If you're building something for which you can't easily get
a small set of users to observe — e.g. enterprise software — and
in a domain where you have no connections, you'll have to rely on
cold calls and introductions.  But should you even be working on
such an idea?<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Garry Tan pointed out an interesting trap founders fall into
in the beginning.  They want so much to seem big that they imitate
even the flaws of big companies, like indifference to individual
users.  This seems to them more "professional."  Actually it's
better to embrace the fact that you're small and use whatever
advantages that brings.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Your user model almost couldn't be perfectly accurate, because
users' needs often change in response to what you build for them.
Build them a microcomputer, and suddenly they need to run spreadsheets
on it, because the arrival of your new microcomputer causes someone
to invent the spreadsheet.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
If you have to choose between the subset that will sign up
quickest and those that will pay the most, it's usually best to
pick the former, because those are probably the early adopters.
They'll have a better influence on your product, and they won't
make you expend as much effort on sales.  And though they have less
money, you don't need that much to maintain your target growth rate
early on.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Yes, I can imagine cases where you could end up making
something that was really only useful for one user.  But those are
usually obvious, even to inexperienced founders.  So if it's not
obvious you'd be making something for a market of one, don't worry
about that danger.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
There may even be an inverse correlation between launch
magnitude and success.  The only launches I remember are famous
flops like the Segway and Google Wave.  Wave is a particularly
alarming example, because I think it was actually a great idea that
was killed partly by its overdone launch.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
Google grew big on the back of Yahoo, but that wasn't a
partnership.  Yahoo was their customer.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
It will also remind founders that an idea where the second
component is empty — an idea where there is nothing you can do
to get going, e.g. because you have no way to find users to recruit
manually — is probably a bad idea, at least for those founders.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, Kevin

<p>
August 2013<br><br>When people hurt themselves lifting heavy things, it's usually
because they try to lift with their back.  The right way to lift
heavy things is to let your legs do the work.  Inexperienced founders
make the same mistake when trying to convince investors.  They try
to convince with their pitch.  Most would be better off if they let
their startup do the work — if they started by understanding why
their startup is worth investing in, then simply explained this
well to investors.<br><br>Investors are looking for startups that will be very successful.
But that test is not as simple as it sounds.  In startups, as in a
lot of other domains, the distribution of outcomes follows a power
law, but in startups the curve is startlingly steep.  The big
successes are so big they 
<a href="swan.html">dwarf</a> the rest.  And since there are only
a handful each year (the conventional wisdom is 15), investors treat
"big success" as if it were binary.  Most are interested in you if
you seem like you have a chance, however small, of being one of the
15 big successes, and otherwise not.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>(There are a handful of angels who'd be interested in a company
with a high probability of being moderately successful.  But angel
investors like big successes too.)<br><br>How do you seem like you'll be one of the big successes?  You need
three things: formidable founders, a promising market, and (usually)
some evidence of success so far.<br><br><b>Formidable</b><br><br>The most important ingredient is formidable founders.  Most investors
decide in the first few minutes whether you seem like a winner or
a loser, and once their opinion is set it's hard to change.&nbsp;<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Every startup has reasons both to invest and not to invest.  If
investors think you're a winner they focus on the former, and if
not they focus on the latter.  For example, it might be a rich
market, but with a slow sales cycle.  If investors are impressed
with you as founders, they say they want to invest because it's a
rich market, and if not, they say they can't invest because of the
slow sales cycle.<br><br>They're not necessarily trying to mislead you.  Most investors are
genuinely unclear in their own minds why they like or dislike
startups.  If you seem like a winner, they'll like your idea more.
But don't be too smug about this weakness of theirs, because you
have it too; almost everyone does.<br><br>There is a role for ideas of course.  They're fuel for the fire
that starts with liking the founders.  Once investors like you,
you'll see them reaching for ideas: they'll be saying "yes, and you
could also do x."  (Whereas when they don't like you, they'll be
saying "but what about y?")<br><br>But the foundation of convincing investors is to seem formidable,
and since this isn't a word most people use in conversation much,
I should explain what it means.  A formidable person is one who
seems like they'll get what they want, regardless of whatever
obstacles are in the way.  Formidable is close to confident, except
that someone could be confident and mistaken.  Formidable is roughly
justifiably confident.<br><br>There are a handful of people who are really good at seeming
formidable — some because they actually are very formidable and
just let it show, and others because they are more or less con
artists.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
But most founders, including many who will go on
to start very successful companies, are not that good at seeming
formidable the first time they try fundraising.  What should they
do?
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>What they should not do is try to imitate the swagger of more
experienced founders.  Investors are not always that good at judging
technology, but they're good at judging confidence.  If you try to
act like something you're not, you'll just end up in an uncanny
valley.  You'll depart from sincere, but never arrive at convincing.<br><br><b>Truth</b><br><br>The way to seem most formidable as an inexperienced founder is to
stick to the truth.   How formidable you seem isn't a constant.  It
varies depending on what you're saying.  Most people can seem
confident when they're saying "one plus one is two," because they
know it's true.  The most diffident person would be puzzled and
even slightly contemptuous if they told a VC "one plus one is two"
and the VC reacted with skepticism.  The magic ability of people
who are good at seeming formidable is that they can do this with
the sentence "we're going to make a billion dollars a year."  But
you can do the same, if not with that sentence with some fairly
impressive ones, so long as you convince yourself first.<br><br>That's the secret.  Convince yourself that your startup is worth
investing in, and then when you explain this to investors they'll
believe you.  And by convince yourself, I don't mean play mind games
with yourself to boost your confidence.  I mean truly evaluate
whether your startup is worth investing in.  If it isn't, don't try
to raise money.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
But if it is, you'll be telling the truth
when you tell investors it's worth investing in, and they'll sense
that.  You don't have to be a smooth presenter if you understand
something well and tell the truth about it.<br><br>To evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in, you have
to be a domain expert.  If you're not a domain expert, you can be
as convinced as you like about your idea, and it will seem to
investors no more than an instance of the Dunning-Kruger effect.
Which in fact it will usually be.  And investors can tell fairly
quickly whether you're a domain expert by how well you answer their
questions.  Know everything about your market.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Why do founders persist in trying to convince investors of things
they're not convinced of themselves?  Partly because we've all been
trained to.<br><br>When my friends Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell were in grad
school, one of their fellow students was on the receiving end of a
question from their faculty advisor that we still quote today.  When
the unfortunate fellow got to his last slide, the professor burst
out:
</p><blockquote>
  Which one of these conclusions do you actually believe?
</blockquote>
One of the artifacts of the way schools are organized is that we
all get trained to talk even when we have nothing to say.  If you
have a ten page paper due, then ten pages you must write, even if
you only have one page of ideas.  Even if you have no ideas.  You
have to produce something.  And all too many startups go into
fundraising in the same spirit.  When they think it's time to raise
money, they try gamely to make the best case they can for their
startup.  Most never think of pausing beforehand to ask whether
what they're saying is actually convincing, because they've all
been trained to treat the need to present as a given — as an area
of fixed size, over which however much truth they have must needs
be spread, however thinly.<br><br>The time to raise money is not when you need it, or when you reach
some artificial deadline like a Demo Day.  It's when you can convince
investors, and not before. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>And unless you're a good con artist, you'll never convince investors
if you're not convinced yourself.  They're far better at detecting
bullshit than you are at producing it, even if you're producing it
unknowingly.  If you try to convince investors before you've convinced
yourself, you'll be wasting both your time.<br><br>But pausing first to convince yourself will do more than save you
from wasting your time.  It will force you to organize your thoughts.
To convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, you'll
have to figure out why it's worth investing in.   And if you can
do that you'll end up with more than added confidence.  You'll also
have a provisional roadmap of how to succeed.<br><br><b>Market</b><br><br>Notice I've been careful to talk about whether a startup is worth
investing in, rather than whether it's going to succeed.  No one
knows whether a startup is going to succeed.  And it's a good thing
for investors that this is so, because if you could know in advance
whether a startup would succeed, the stock price would already be
the future price, and there would be no room for investors to make
money.  Startup investors know that every investment is a bet, and
against pretty long odds.<br><br>So to prove you're worth investing in, you don't have to prove
you're going to succeed, just that you're a sufficiently good bet.
What makes a startup a sufficiently good bet?  In addition to
formidable founders, you need a plausible path to owning a big piece
of a big market.  Founders think of startups as ideas, but investors
think of them as markets.  If there are x number of customers who'd
pay an average of $y per year for what you're making, then the total
addressable market, or TAM, of your company is $xy.  Investors don't
expect you to collect all that money, but it's an upper bound on
how big you can get.<br><br>Your target market has to be big, and it also has to be capturable
by you.  But the market doesn't have to be big yet, nor do you
necessarily have to be in it yet.  Indeed, it's often better to
start in a <a href="ds.html">small</a> market that will either turn into a big one or
from which you can move into a big one.  There just has to be some
plausible sequence of hops that leads to dominating a big market a
few years down the line.<br><br>The standard of plausibility varies dramatically depending on the
age of the startup.  A three month old company at Demo Day only
needs to be a promising experiment that's worth funding to see how
it turns out.  Whereas a two year old company raising a series A
round needs to be able to show the experiment worked. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>But every company that gets really big is "lucky" in the sense that
their growth is due mostly to some external wave they're riding,
so to make a convincing case for becoming huge, you have to identify
some specific trend you'll benefit from.  Usually you can find this
by asking "why now?"  If this is such a great idea, why hasn't
someone else already done it?  Ideally the answer is that it only
recently became a good idea, because something changed, and no one
else has noticed yet.<br><br>Microsoft for example was not going to grow huge selling Basic
interpreters.  But by starting there they were perfectly poised to
expand up the stack of microcomputer software as microcomputers
grew powerful enough to support one. And microcomputers turned out
to be a really huge wave, bigger than even the most optimistic
observers would have predicted in 1975.<br><br>But while Microsoft did really well and there is thus a temptation
to think they would have seemed a great bet a few months in, they
probably didn't.  Good, but not great.  No company, however successful,
ever looks more than a pretty good bet a few months in. Microcomputers
turned out to be a big deal, and Microsoft both executed well and
got lucky.  But it was by no means obvious that this was how things
would play out.  Plenty of companies seem as good a bet a few months
in.  I don't know about startups in general, but at least half the
startups we fund could make as good a case as Microsoft could have
for being on a path to dominating a large market.  And who can
reasonably expect more of a startup than that?<br><br><b>Rejection</b><br><br>If you can make as good a case as Microsoft could have, will you
convince investors?  Not always.  A lot of VCs would have rejected
Microsoft.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font>
Certainly some rejected Google.  And getting
rejected will put you in a slightly awkward position, because as
you'll see when you start fundraising, the most common question
you'll get from investors will be "who else is investing?" What do
you say if you've been fundraising for a while and no one has
committed yet? 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>The people who are really good at acting formidable often solve
this problem by giving investors the impression that while no
investors have committed yet, several are about to.  This is arguably
a permissible tactic.  It's slightly dickish of investors to care
more about who else is investing than any other aspect of your
startup, and misleading them about how far along you are with other
investors seems the complementary countermove.  It's arguably an
instance of scamming a scammer. But I don't recommend this approach
to most founders, because most founders wouldn't be able to carry
it off.  This is the single most common lie told to investors, and
you have to be really good at lying to tell members of some profession
the most common lie they're told.<br><br>If you're not a master of negotiation (and perhaps even if you are)
the best solution is to tackle the problem head-on, and to explain
why investors have turned you down and why they're mistaken.  If
you know you're on the right track, then you also know why investors
were wrong to reject you. Experienced investors are well aware that
the best ideas are also the scariest.  They all know about the VCs
who rejected Google.  If instead of seeming evasive and ashamed
about having been turned down (and thereby implicitly agreeing with
the verdict) you talk candidly about what scared investors about
you, you'll seem more confident, which they like, and you'll probably
also do a better job of presenting that aspect of your startup.  At
the very least, that worry will now be out in the open instead of
being a gotcha left to be discovered by the investors you're currently
talking to, who will be proud of and thus attached to their discovery.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>This strategy will work best with the best investors, who are both
hard to bluff and who already believe most other investors are
conventional-minded drones doomed always to miss the big outliers.
Raising money is not like applying to college, where you can assume
that if you can get into MIT, you can also get into Foobar State.
Because the best investors are much smarter than the rest, and the
best startup ideas look initially like 
<a href="startupideas.html">bad ideas</a>, it's not uncommon
for a startup to be rejected by all the VCs except the best ones.
That's what happened to Dropbox.  Y Combinator started in Boston,
and for the first 3 years we ran alternating batches in Boston and
Silicon Valley.  Because Boston investors were so few and so timid,
we used to ship Boston batches out for a second Demo Day in Silicon
Valley.  Dropbox was part of a Boston batch, which means all those
Boston investors got the first look at Dropbox, and none of them
closed the deal.  Yet another backup and syncing thing, they all
thought.  A couple weeks later, Dropbox raised a series A round
from Sequoia.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Different</b><br><br>Not understanding that investors view investments as bets combines
with the ten page paper mentality to prevent founders from even
considering the possibility of being certain of what they're saying.
They think they're trying to convince investors of something very
uncertain — that their startup will be huge — and convincing anyone
of something like that must obviously entail some wild feat of
salesmanship.  But in fact when you raise money you're trying to
convince investors of something so much less speculative — whether
the company has all the elements of a good bet — that you can
approach the problem in a qualitatively different way.  You can
convince yourself, then convince them.<br><br>And when you convince them, use the same matter-of-fact language
you used to convince yourself.  You wouldn't use vague, grandiose
marketing-speak among yourselves.  Don't use it with investors
either.  It not only doesn't work on them, but seems a mark of
incompetence.  Just be concise.  Many investors explicitly use that
as a test, reasoning (correctly) that if you can't explain your
plans concisely, you don't really understand them.  But even investors
who don't have a rule about this will be bored and frustrated by
unclear explanations.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>So here's the recipe for impressing investors when you're not already
good at seeming formidable:
<ol>
<li> Make something worth investing in.<br><br></li><li> Understand why it's worth investing in.<br><br></li><li> Explain that clearly to investors.
</li></ol>
If you're saying something you know is true, you'll seem confident
when you're saying it.  Conversely, never let pitching draw you
into bullshitting.  As long as you stay on the territory of truth,
you're strong.  Make the truth good, then just tell it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
There's no reason to believe this number is a constant.  In
fact it's our explicit goal at Y Combinator to increase it, by
encouraging people to start startups who otherwise wouldn't have.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Or more precisely, investors decide whether you're a loser
or possibly a winner.  If you seem like a winner, they may then,
depending on how much you're raising, have several more meetings
with you to test whether that initial impression holds up.<br><br>But if you seem like a loser they're done, at least for the next
year or so.  And when they decide you're a loser they usually decide
in way less than the 50 minutes they may have allotted for the first
meeting.  Which explains the astonished stories one always hears
about VC inattentiveness.  How could these people make investment
decisions well when they're checking their messages during startups'
presentations?  The solution to that mystery is that they've already
made the decision.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The two are not mutually exclusive.  There are people who are
both genuinely formidable, and also really good at acting that way.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
How can people who will go on to create giant companies not
seem formidable early on?  I think the main reason is that their
experience so far has trained them to keep their wings folded, as
it were.  Family, school, and jobs encourage cooperation, not
conquest.  And it's just as well they do, because even being Genghis
Khan is probably 99% cooperation.  But the result is that most
people emerge from the tube of their upbringing in their early
twenties compressed into the shape of the tube.  Some find they
have wings and start to spread them.  But this takes a few years.
In the beginning even they don't know yet what they're capable of.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
In fact, change what you're doing.  You're investing your own
time in your startup.  If you're not convinced that what you're
working on is a sufficiently good bet, why are you even working on
that?<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
When investors ask you a question you don't know the answer
to, the best response is neither to bluff nor give up, but instead
to explain how you'd figure out the answer.  If you can work out a
preliminary answer on the spot, so much the better, but explain
that's what you're doing.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
At YC we try to ensure startups are ready to raise money on
Demo Day by encouraging them to ignore investors and instead focus
on their companies till about a week before.  That way most reach
the stage where they're sufficiently convincing well before Demo
Day.  But not all do, so we also give any startup that wants to the
option of deferring to a later Demo Day.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Founders are often surprised by how much harder it is to raise
the next round.  There is a qualitative difference in investors'
attitudes.  It's like the difference between being judged as a kid
and as an adult.  The next time you raise money, it's not enough
to be promising.  You have to be delivering results.<br><br>So although it works well to show growth graphs at either stage,
investors treat them differently.  At three months, a growth graph
is mostly evidence that the founders are effective.  At two years,
it has to be evidence of a promising market and a company tuned to
exploit it.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
By this I mean that if the present day equivalent of the 3
month old Microsoft presented at a Demo Day, there would be investors
who turned them down.  Microsoft itself didn't raise outside money,
and indeed the venture business barely existed when they got started
in 1975.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
The best investors rarely care who else is investing, but
mediocre investors almost all do.  So you can use this question as
a test of investor quality.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
To use this technique, you'll have to find out why investors
who rejected you did so, or at least what they claim was the reason.
That may require asking, because investors don't always volunteer
a lot of detail.  Make it clear when you ask that you're not trying
to dispute their decision — just that if there is some weakness in
your plans, you need to know about it.  You won't always get a real
reason out of them, but you should at least try.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
Dropbox wasn't rejected by all the East Coast VCs.  There was
one firm that wanted to invest but tried to lowball them.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
Alfred Lin points out that it's doubly important for the
explanation of a startup to be clear and concise, because it has
to convince at one remove: it has to work not just on the partner
you talk to, but when that partner re-tells it to colleagues.<br><br>We consciously optimize for this at YC.  When we work with founders
create a Demo Day pitch, the last step is to imagine how an investor
would sell it to colleagues.<br><br>

August 2013<br><br>The biggest component in most investors' opinion of you is the
opinion of other investors.  Which is of course a recipe for
exponential growth.  When one investor wants to invest in you, that
makes other investors want to, which makes others want to, and so
on.<br><br>Sometimes inexperienced founders mistakenly conclude that manipulating
these forces is the essence of fundraising.  They hear stories about
stampedes to invest in successful startups, and think it's therefore
the mark of a successful startup to have this happen.  But actually
the two are not that highly correlated.  Lots of startups that cause
stampedes end up flaming out (in extreme cases, partly as a result
of the stampede), and lots of very successful startups were only
moderately popular with investors the first time they raised money.<br><br>So the point of this essay is not to explain how to create a stampede,
but merely to explain the forces that generate them.  These forces
are always at work to some degree in fundraising, and they can cause
surprising situations.  If you understand them, you can at least
avoid being surprised.<br><br>One reason investors like you more when other investors like you
is that you actually become a better investment.  Raising money
decreases the risk of failure.  Indeed, although investors hate it,
you are for this reason justified in raising your valuation for
later investors.  The investors who invested when you had no money
were taking more risk, and are entitled to higher returns.  Plus a
company that has raised money is literally more valuable.  After
you raise the first million dollars, the company is at least a
million dollars more valuable, because it's the same company as
before, plus it has a million dollars in the bank.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Beware, though, because later investors so hate to have the price
raised on them that they resist even this self-evident reasoning.
Only raise the price on an investor you're comfortable with losing,
because some will angrily refuse.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The second reason investors like you more when you've had some
success at fundraising is that it makes you more confident, and an
investors' opinion of <a href="convince.html">you</a> is the foundation
of their opinion of your company.  Founders are often surprised how
quickly investors seem to know when they start to succeed at raising
money.  And while there are in fact lots of ways for such information
to spread among investors, the main vector is probably the founders
themselves.  Though they're often clueless about technology, most
investors are pretty good at reading people.  When fundraising is
going well, investors are quick to sense it in your increased
confidence.  (This is one case where the average founder's inability
to remain poker-faced works to your advantage.)<br><br>But frankly the most important reason investors like you more when
you've started to raise money is that they're bad at judging startups.
Judging startups is hard even for the best investors.  The mediocre
ones might as well be flipping coins.  So when mediocre investors
see that lots of other people want to invest in you, they assume
there must be a reason.  This leads to the phenomenon known in the
Valley as the "hot deal," where you have more interest from investors
than you can handle.<br><br>The best investors aren't influenced much by the opinion of other
investors.  It would only dilute their own judgment to average it
together with other people's.  But they are indirectly influenced
in the practical sense that interest from other investors imposes
a deadline.  This is the fourth way in which offers beget offers.
If you start to get far along the track toward an offer with one
firm, it will sometimes provoke other firms, even good ones, to
make up their minds, lest they lose the deal.<br><br>Unless you're a wizard at negotiation (and if you're not sure,
you're not) be very careful about exaggerating this to push a good
investor to decide.  Founders try this sort of thing all the time,
and investors are very sensitive to it.  If anything oversensitive.
But you're safe so long as you're telling the truth.  If you're
getting far along with investor B, but you'd rather raise money
from investor A, you can tell investor A that this is happening.
There's no manipulation in that.  You're genuinely in a bind, because
you really would rather raise money from A, but you can't safely
reject an offer from B when it's still uncertain what A will decide.<br><br>Do not, however, tell A who B is.  VCs will sometimes ask which
other VCs you're talking to, but you should never tell them.  Angels
you can sometimes tell about other angels, because angels cooperate
more with one another. But if VCs ask, just point out that they
wouldn't want you telling other firms about your conversations, and
you feel obliged to do the same for any firm you talk to.  If they
push you, point out that you're inexperienced at fundraising — which
is always a safe card to play — and you feel you have to be
extra cautious. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>While few startups will experience a stampede of interest, almost
all will at least initially experience the other side of this
phenomenon, where the herd remains clumped together at a distance.
The fact that investors are so much influenced by other investors'
opinions means you always start out in something of a hole.  So
don't be demoralized by how hard it is to get the first commitment,
because much of the difficulty comes from this external force.  The
second will be easier.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
An accountant might say that a company that has raised a million
dollars is no richer if it's convertible debt, but in practice money
raised as convertible debt is little different from money raised
in an equity round.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Founders are often surprised by this, but investors can get
very emotional.  Or rather indignant; that's the main emotion I've
observed; but it is very common, to the point where it sometimes
causes investors to act against their own interests.  I know of one
investor who invested in a startup at a $15 million valuation cap.
Earlier he'd had an opportunity to invest at a $5 million cap, but
he refused because a friend who invested earlier had been able to
invest at a $3 million cap.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
If an investor pushes you hard to tell them about your conversations
with other investors, is this someone you want as an investor?<br><br>

<p>
September 2013<br><br>Most startups that raise money do it more than once.  A typical
trajectory might be (1) to get started with a few tens of thousands
from something like Y Combinator or individual angels, then 
(2) raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company,
and then (3) once the company is clearly succeeding, raise one or
more later rounds to accelerate growth.<br><br>Reality can be messier.  Some companies raise money twice in phase
2.  Others skip phase 1 and go straight to phase 2.  And at Y&nbsp;Combinator 
we get an increasing number of companies that have already
raised amounts in the hundreds of thousands.  But the three phase
path is at least the one about which individual startups' paths
oscillate.<br><br>This essay focuses on phase 2 fundraising.  That's the type the
startups we fund are doing on Demo Day, and this essay is the advice
we give them.<br><br>
<b>Forces</b><br><br>Fundraising is hard in both senses: hard like lifting a heavy weight,
and hard like solving a puzzle.  It's hard like lifting a weight
because it's intrinsically hard to convince people to part with
large sums of money.  That problem is irreducible; it should be
hard.  But much of the other kind of difficulty can be eliminated.
Fundraising only seems a puzzle because it's an alien world to most
founders, and I hope to fix that by supplying a map through it.<br><br>To founders, the behavior of investors is often opaque — partly
because their motivations are obscure, but partly because they
deliberately mislead you.  And the misleading ways of investors
combine horribly with the wishful thinking of inexperienced founders.
At YC we're always warning founders about this danger, and investors
are probably more circumspect with YC startups than with other
companies they talk to, and even so we witness a constant series
of explosions as these two volatile components combine.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you're an inexperienced founder, the only way to survive is by
imposing external constraints on yourself.  You can't trust your
intuitions.  I'm going to give you a set of rules here that will
get you through this process if anything will.  At certain moments
you'll be tempted to ignore them.  So rule number zero is: these
rules exist for a reason.  You wouldn't need a rule to keep you
going in one direction if there weren't powerful forces pushing you
in another.<br><br>The ultimate source of the forces acting on you are the forces
acting on investors.  Investors are pinched between two kinds of
fear: fear of investing in startups that fizzle, and fear of missing
out on startups that take off.  The cause of all this fear is the
very thing that makes startups such attractive investments: the
successful ones grow very fast.  But that fast growth means investors
can't wait around.  If you wait till a startup is obviously a
success, it's too late.  To get the really high returns, you have
to invest in startups when it's still unclear how they'll do.  But
that in turn makes investors nervous they're about to invest in a
flop.  As indeed they often are.<br><br>What investors would like to do, if they could, is wait.  When a
startup is only a few months old, every week that passes gives you
significantly more information about them.  But if you wait too
long, other investors might take the deal away from you.  And of
course the other investors are all subject to the same forces.  So
what tends to happen is that they all wait as long as they can,
then when some act the rest have to.<br><br>
<b>Don't raise money unless you want it and it wants you.</b><br><br>Such a high proportion of successful startups raise money that it
might seem fundraising is one of the defining qualities of a startup.
Actually it isn't.  <a href="growth.html">Rapid growth</a> is what
makes a company a startup.  Most companies in a position to grow
rapidly find that (a) taking outside money helps them grow faster,
and (b) their growth potential makes it easy to attract such money.
It's so common for both (a) and (b) to be true of a successful
startup that practically all do raise outside money.  But there may
be cases where a startup either wouldn't want to grow faster, or
outside money wouldn't help them to, and if you're one of them,
don't raise money.<br><br>The other time not to raise money is when you won't be able to.  If
you try to raise money before you can <a href="convince.html">convince</a>
investors, you'll not only waste your time, but also burn your
reputation with those investors.<br><br>
<b>Be in fundraising mode or not.</b><br><br>One of the things that surprises founders most about fundraising
is how distracting it is.  When you start fundraising, everything
else grinds to a halt.  The problem is not the time fundraising
consumes but that it becomes the <a href="top.html">top idea in
your mind</a>.  A startup can't endure that level of distraction
for long.  An early stage startup grows mostly because the founders
<a href="ds.html">make</a> it grow, and if the founders look away,
growth usually drops sharply.<br><br>Because fundraising is so distracting, a startup should either be
in fundraising mode or not.  And when you do decide to raise money,
you should focus your whole attention on it so you can get it done
quickly and get back to work.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>You can take money from investors when you're not in fundraising
mode.  You just can't expend any attention on it.  There are two
things that take attention: convincing investors, and negotiating
with them.  So when you're not in fundraising mode, you should take
money from investors only if they require no convincing, and are
willing to invest on terms you'll take without negotiation.  For
example, if a reputable investor is willing to invest on a convertible
note, using standard paperwork, that is either uncapped or capped
at a good valuation, you can take that without having to think.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
The terms will be whatever they turn out to be in your next
equity round.  And "no convincing" means just that: zero time spent
meeting with investors or preparing materials for them.  If an
investor says they're ready to invest, but they need you to come
in for one meeting to meet some of the partners, tell them no, if
you're not in fundraising mode, because that's fundraising. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
Tell them politely; tell them you're focusing on the company right
now, and that you'll get back to them when you're fundraising; but
do not get sucked down the slippery slope.<br><br>Investors will try to lure you into fundraising when you're not.
It's great for them if they can, because they can thereby get a
shot at you before everyone else.  They'll send you emails saying
they want to meet to learn more about you.  If you get cold-emailed
by an associate at a VC firm, you shouldn't meet even if you are
in fundraising mode.  Deals don't happen that way.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
But even
if you get an email from a partner you should try to delay meeting
till you're in fundraising mode.  They may say they just want to
meet and chat, but investors never just want to meet and chat.  What
if they like you?  What if they start to talk about giving you
money?  Will you be able to resist having that conversation?  Unless
you're experienced enough at fundraising to have a casual conversation
with investors that stays casual, it's safer to tell them that you'd
be happy to later, when you're fundraising, but that right now you
need to focus on the company.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Companies that are successful at raising money in phase 2 sometimes
tack on a few investors after leaving fundraising mode.  This is
fine; if fundraising went well, you'll be able to do it without
spending time convincing them or negotiating about terms.<br><br>
<b>Get introductions to investors.</b><br><br>Before you can talk to investors, you have to be introduced to them.
If you're presenting at a Demo Day, you'll be introduced to a whole
bunch simultaneously.  But even if you are, you should supplement
these with intros you collect yourself.<br><br>Do you have to be introduced?  In phase 2, yes.  Some investors
will let you email them a business plan, but you can tell from the
way their sites are organized that they don't really want startups
to approach them directly.<br><br>Intros vary greatly in effectiveness.  The best type of intro is
from a well-known investor who has just invested in you.  So when
you get an investor to commit, ask them to introduce you to other
investors they respect.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
The next best type of intro is from a
founder of a company they've funded.  You can also get intros from
other people in the startup community, like lawyers and reporters.<br><br>There are now sites like AngelList, FundersClub, and WeFunder that
can introduce you to investors.  We recommend startups treat them
as auxiliary sources of money.  Raise money first from leads you
get yourself.  Those will on average be better investors.  Plus
you'll have an easier time raising money on these sites once you
can say you've already raised some from well-known investors.<br><br>
<b>Hear no till you hear yes.</b><br><br>Treat investors as saying no till they unequivocally say yes, in
the form of a definite offer with no contingencies.<br><br>I mentioned earlier that investors prefer to wait if they can.
What's particularly dangerous for founders is the way they wait.
Essentially, they lead you on.  They seem like they're about to
invest right up till the moment they say no.  If they even say no.
Some of the worse ones never actually do say no; they just stop
replying to your emails.  They hope that way to get a free option
on investing.  If they decide later that they want to invest — usually
because they've heard you're a hot deal — they can pretend they
just got distracted and then restart the conversation as if they'd
been about to.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>That's not the worst thing investors will do.  Some will use language
that makes it sound as if they're committing, but which doesn't
actually commit them.  And wishful thinking founders are happy to
meet them half way.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>Fortunately, the next rule is a tactic for neutralizing this behavior.
But to work it depends on you not being tricked by the no that
sounds like yes.  It's so common for founders to be misled/mistaken
about this that we designed a <a href="http://ycombinator.com/hdp.html">protocol</a> to fix the
problem.  If you believe an investor has committed, get them to
confirm it.  If you and they have different views of reality, whether
the source of the discrepancy is their sketchiness or your wishful
thinking, the prospect of confirming a commitment in writing will
flush it out.  And till they confirm, regard them as saying no.<br><br>
<b>Do breadth-first search weighted by expected value.</b><br><br>When you talk to investors your m.o. should be breadth-first search,
weighted by expected value.  You should always talk to investors
in parallel rather than serially.  You can't afford the time it
takes to talk to investors serially, plus if you only talk to one
investor at a time, they don't have the pressure of other investors
to make them act.  But you shouldn't pay the same attention to every
investor, because some are more promising prospects than others.
The optimal solution is to talk to all potential investors in
parallel, but give higher priority to the more promising ones. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>Expected value = how likely an investor is to say yes, multiplied
by how good it would be if they did.  So for example, an eminent
investor who would invest a lot, but will be hard to convince, might
have the same expected value as an obscure angel who won't invest
much, but will be easy to convince.  Whereas an obscure angel who
will only invest a small amount, and yet needs to meet multiple
times before making up his mind, has very low expected value.  Meet
such investors last, if at all. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>Doing breadth-first search weighted by expected value will save you
from investors who never explicitly say no but merely drift away,
because you'll drift away from them at the same rate.  It protects
you from investors who flake in much the same way that a distributed
algorithm protects you from processors that fail.  If some investor
isn't returning your emails, or wants to have lots of meetings but
isn't progressing toward making you an offer, you automatically
focus less on them.  But you have to be disciplined about assigning
probabilities.  You can't let how much you want an investor influence
your estimate of how much they want you.<br><br>
<b>Know where you stand.</b><br><br>How do you judge how well you're doing with an investor, when
investors habitually seem more positive than they are?  By looking
at their actions rather than their words.  Every investor has some
track they need to move along from the first conversation to wiring
the money, and you should always know what that track consists of,
where you are on it, and how fast you're moving forward.<br><br>Never leave a meeting with an investor without asking what happens
next.  What more do they need in order to decide?  Do they need
another meeting with you?  To talk about what?  And how soon?  Do
they need to do something internally, like talk to their partners,
or investigate some issue?  How long do they expect it to take?
Don't be too pushy, but know where you stand.  If investors are
vague or resist answering such questions, assume the worst; investors
who are seriously interested in you will usually be happy to talk
about what has to happen between now and wiring the money, because
they're already running through that in their heads. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you're experienced at negotiations, you already know how to ask
such questions.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font>
If you're not, there's a trick you can use
in this situation.  Investors know you're inexperienced at raising
money.  Inexperience there doesn't make you unattractive.  Being a
noob at technology would, if you're starting a technology startup,
but not being a noob at fundraising.  Larry and Sergey were noobs
at fundraising.  So you can just confess that you're inexperienced
at this and ask how their process works and where you are in it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#999999">14</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Get the first commitment.</b><br><br>The biggest factor in most investors' opinions of you is the opinion
of <a href="herd.html">other investors</a>.  Once you start getting
investors to commit, it becomes increasingly easy to get more to.
But the other side of this coin is that it's often hard to get the
first commitment.<br><br>Getting the first substantial offer can be half the total difficulty
of fundraising.  What counts as a substantial offer depends on who
it's from and how much it is.  Money from friends and family doesn't
usually count, no matter how much.  But if you get $50k from a well
known VC firm or angel investor, that will usually be enough to set
things rolling.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#999999">15</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Close committed money.</b><br><br>It's not a deal till the money's in the bank.  I often hear
inexperienced founders say things like "We've raised $800,000,"
only to discover that zero of it is in the bank so far.  Remember
the twin fears that torment investors?  The fear of missing out
that makes them jump early, and the fear of jumping onto a turd
that results?  This is a market where people are exceptionally prone
to buyer's remorse.  And it's also one that furnishes them plenty
of excuses to gratify it.  The public markets snap startup investing
around like a whip.  If the Chinese economy blows up tomorrow, all
bets are off.  But there are lots of surprises for individual
startups too, and they tend to be concentrated around fundraising.
Tomorrow a big competitor could appear, or you could get C&amp;Ded, or
your cofounder could quit.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#999999">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>Even a day's delay can bring news that causes an investor to change
their mind.  So when someone commits, get the money.  Knowing where
you stand doesn't end when they say they'll invest.  After they say
yes, know what the timetable is for getting the money, and then
babysit that process till it happens.  Institutional investors have
people in charge of wiring money, but you may have to hunt angels
down in person to collect a check.<br><br>Inexperienced investors are the ones most likely to get buyer's
remorse.  Established ones have learned to treat saying yes as like
diving off a diving board, and they also have more brand to preserve.
But I've heard of cases of even top-tier VC firms welching on deals.<br><br>
<b>Avoid investors who don't "lead."</b><br><br>Since getting the first offer is most of the difficulty of fundraising,
that should be part of your calculation of expected value when you
start.  You have to estimate not just the probability that an
investor will say yes, but the probability that they'd be the <i>first</i>
to say yes, and the latter is not simply a constant fraction of the
former.  Some investors are known for deciding quickly, and those
are extra valuable early on.<br><br>Conversely, an investor who will only invest once other investors
have is worthless initially.  And while most investors are influenced
by how interested other investors are in you, there are some who
have an explicit policy of only investing after other investors
have.  You can recognize this contemptible subspecies of investor
because they often talk about "leads."  They say that they don't
lead, or that they'll invest once you have a lead.  Sometimes they
even claim to be willing to lead themselves, by which they mean
they won't invest till you get $x from other investors.  (It's great
if by "lead" they mean they'll invest unilaterally, and in addition
will help you raise more.  What's lame is when they use the term
to mean they won't invest unless you can raise more elsewhere.)
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f17n"><font color="#999999">17</font></a>]</font><br><br>Where does this term "lead" come from?  Up till a few years ago,
startups raising money in phase 2 would usually raise equity rounds
in which several investors invested at the same time using the same
paperwork.  You'd negotiate the terms with one "lead" investor, and
then all the others would sign the same documents and all the money
change hands at the closing.<br><br>Series A rounds still work that way, but things now work differently
for most fundraising prior to the series A.  Now there are rarely
actual rounds before the A round, or leads for them.  Now startups
simply raise money from investors one at a time till they feel they
have enough.<br><br>Since there are no longer leads, why do investors use that term?
Because it's a more legitimate-sounding way of saying what they
really mean.  All they really mean is that their interest in you
is a function of other investors' interest in you.  I.e. the spectral
signature of all mediocre investors.  But when phrased in terms of
leads, it sounds like there is something structural and therefore
legitimate about their behavior.<br><br>When an investor tells you "I want to invest in you, but I don't
lead," translate that in your mind to "No, except yes if you turn
out to be a hot deal."  And since that's the default opinion of any
investor about any startup, they've essentially just told you
nothing.<br><br>When you first start fundraising, the expected value of an investor
who won't "lead" is zero, so talk to such investors last if at all.<br><br>
<b>Have multiple plans.</b><br><br>Many investors will ask how much you're planning to raise. This
question makes founders feel they should be planning to raise a
specific amount.  But in fact you shouldn't.  It's a mistake to
have fixed plans in an undertaking as unpredictable as fundraising.<br><br>So why do investors ask how much you plan to raise?  For much the
same reasons a salesperson in a store will ask "How much were you
planning to spend?" if you walk in looking for a gift for a friend.
You probably didn't have a precise amount in mind; you just want
to find something good, and if it's inexpensive, so much the better.
The salesperson asks you this not because you're supposed to have
a plan to spend a specific amount, but so they can show you only
things that cost the most you'll pay.<br><br>Similarly, when investors ask how much you plan to raise, it's not
because you're supposed to have a plan.  It's to see whether you'd
be a suitable recipient for the size of investment they like to
make, and also to judge your ambition, reasonableness, and how far
you are along with fundraising.<br><br>If you're a wizard at fundraising, you can say "We plan to raise
a $7 million series A round, and we'll be accepting termsheets next
tuesday."  I've known a handful of founders who could pull that off
without having VCs laugh in their faces.  But if you're in the
inexperienced but earnest majority, the solution is analogous to
the solution I recommend for <a href="convince.html">pitching</a>
your startup: do the right thing and then just tell investors what
you're doing.<br><br>And the right strategy, in fundraising, is to have multiple plans
depending on how much you can raise.  Ideally you should be able
to tell investors something like: we can make it to profitability
without raising any more money, but if we raise a few hundred
thousand we can hire one or two smart friends, and if we raise a
couple million, we can hire a whole engineering team, etc.<br><br>Different plans match different investors.  If you're talking to a
VC firm that only does series A rounds (though there are few of
those left), it would be a waste of time talking about any but your
most expensive plan.  Whereas if you're talking to an angel who
invests $20k at a time and you haven't raised any money yet, you
probably want to focus on your least expensive plan.<br><br>If you're so fortunate as to have to think about the upper limit
on what you should raise, a good rule of thumb is to multiply the
number of people you want to hire times $15k times 18 months.  In
most startups, nearly all the costs are a function of the number
of people, and $15k per month is the conventional total cost
(including benefits and even office space) per person.  $15k per
month is high, so don't actually spend that much.  But it's ok to
use a high estimate when fundraising to add a margin for error.  If
you have additional expenses, like manufacturing, add in those at
the end.  Assuming you have none and you think you might hire 20
people, the most you'd want to raise is 20 x $15k x 18 = $5.4
million.

<b>Underestimate how much you want.</b><br><br>Though you can focus on different plans when talking to different
types of investors, you should on the whole err on the side of
underestimating the amount you hope to raise.<br><br>For example, if you'd like to raise $500k, it's better to say
initially that you're trying to raise $250k.  Then when you reach
$150k you're more than half done.  That sends two useful signals
to investors: that you're doing well, and that they have to decide
quickly because you're running out of room.  Whereas if you'd said
you were raising $500k, you'd be less than a third done at $150k.
If fundraising stalled there for an appreciable time, you'd start
to read as a failure.<br><br>Saying initially that you're raising $250k doesn't limit you to
raising that much.  When you reach your initial target and you still
have investor interest, you can just decide to raise more.  Startups
do that all the time.  In fact, most startups that are very successful
at fundraising end up raising more than they originally intended.<br><br>I'm not saying you should lie, but that you should lower your
expectations initially.  There is almost no downside in starting
with a low number.  It not only won't cap the amount you raise, but
will on the whole tend to increase it.<br><br>A good metaphor here is angle of attack.  If you try to fly at too
steep an angle of attack, you just stall.  If you say right out of
the gate that you want to raise a $5 million series A round, unless
you're in a very strong position, you not only won't get that but
won't get anything. Better to start at a low angle of attack, build
up speed, and then gradually increase the angle if you want.<br><br>
<b>Be profitable if you can.</b><br><br>You will be in a much stronger position if your collection of plans
includes one for raising zero dollars — i.e. if you can make
it to profitability without raising any additional money.  Ideally
you want to be able to say to investors "We'll succeed no matter
what, but raising money will help us do it faster."<br><br>There are many analogies between fundraising and dating, and this
is one of the strongest.  No one wants you if you seem desperate.
And the best way not to seem desperate is not to <i>be</i> desperate.
That's one reason we urge startups during YC to keep expenses low
and to try to make it to <a href="ramenprofitable.html">ramen
profitability</a> before Demo Day.  Though it sounds slightly
paradoxical, if you want to raise money, the best thing you can do
is get yourself to the point where you don't need to.<br><br>There are almost two distinct modes of fundraising: one in which
founders who need money knock on doors seeking it, knowing that
otherwise the company will die or at the very least people will
have to be fired, and one in which founders who don't need money
take some to grow faster than they could merely on their own revenues.
To emphasize the distinction I'm going to name them: type A fundraising
is when you don't need money, and type B fundraising is when you
do.<br><br>Inexperienced founders read about famous startups doing what was
type A fundraising, and decide they should raise money too, since
that seems to be how startups work. Except when they raise money
they don't have a clear path to profitability and are thus doing
type B fundraising.  And they are then surprised how difficult and
unpleasant it is.<br><br>Of course not all startups can make it to ramen profitability in a
few months.  And some that don't still manage to have the upper
hand over investors, if they have some other advantage like
extraordinary growth numbers or exceptionally formidable founders.
But as time passes it gets increasingly difficult to fundraise from
a position of strength without being profitable.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f19n"><font color="#999999">19</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Don't optimize for valuation.</b><br><br>When you raise money, what should your valuation be?  The most
important thing to understand about valuation is that it's not that
important.<br><br>Founders who raise money at high valuations tend to be unduly proud
of it.  Founders are often competitive people, and since valuation
is usually the only visible number attached to a startup, they end
up competing to raise money at the highest valuation.  This is
stupid, because fundraising is not the test that matters.  The real
test is revenue.  Fundraising is just a means to that end.  Being
proud of how well you did at fundraising is like being proud of
your college grades.<br><br>Not only is fundraising not the test that matters, valuation is not
even the thing to optimize about fundraising.  The number one thing
you want from phase 2 fundraising is to get the money you need, so
you can get back to focusing on the real test, the success of your
company.  Number two is good investors. Valuation is at best third.<br><br>The empirical evidence shows just how unimportant it is.  Dropbox
and Airbnb are the most successful companies we've funded so far,
and they raised money after Y Combinator at premoney valuations of
$4 million and $2.6 million respectively. Prices are so much higher
now that if you can raise money at all you'll probably raise it at
higher valuations than Dropbox and Airbnb.  So let that satisfy
your competitiveness.  You're doing better than Dropbox and Airbnb!
At a test that doesn't matter.<br><br>When you start fundraising, your initial valuation (or valuation
cap) will be set by the deal you make with the first investor who
commits.  You can increase the price for later investors, if you
get a lot of interest, but by default the valuation you got from
the first investor becomes your asking price.<br><br>So if you're raising money from multiple investors, as most companies
do in phase 2, you have to be careful to avoid raising the first
from an over-eager investor at a price you won't be able to
sustain.  You can of course lower your price if you need to (in
which case you should give the same terms to investors who invested
earlier at a higher price), but you may lose a bunch of leads in
the process of realizing you need to do this.<br><br>What you can do if you have eager first investors is raise money
from them on an uncapped convertible note with an MFN clause.  This
is essentially a way of saying that the valuation cap of the note
will be determined by the next investors you raise money from.<br><br>It will be easier to raise money at a lower valuation.  It shouldn't
be, but it is.  Since phase 2 prices vary at most 10x and the big
successes generate returns of at least 100x, investors should pick
startups entirely based on their estimate of the probability that
the company will be a big success and hardly at all on price.  But
although it's a mistake for investors to care about price, a
significant number do.  A startup that investors seem to like but
won't invest in at a cap of $x will have an easier time at $x/2.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f20n"><font color="#999999">20</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Yes/no before valuation.</b><br><br>Some investors want to know what your valuation is before they even
talk to you about investing.  If your valuation has already been
set by a prior investment at a specific valuation or cap, you can
tell them that number.  But if it isn't set because you haven't
closed anyone yet, and they try to push you to name a price, resist
doing so.  If this would be the first investor you've closed, then
this could be the tipping point of fundraising. That means closing
this investor is the first priority, and you need to get the
conversation onto that instead of being dragged sideways into a
discussion of price.<br><br>Fortunately there is a way to avoid naming a price in this situation.
And it is not just a negotiating trick; it's how you (both) should
be operating.  Tell them that valuation is not the most important
thing to you and that you haven't thought much about it, that you
are looking for investors you want to partner with and who want to
partner with you, and that you should talk first about whether they
want to invest at all.  Then if they decide they do want to invest,
you can figure out a price. But first things first.<br><br>Since valuation isn't that important and getting fundraising rolling
is, we usually tell founders to give the first investor who commits
as low a price as they need to.  This is a safe technique so long
as you combine it with the next one. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f21n"><font color="#999999">21</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Beware "valuation sensitive" investors.</b><br><br>Occasionally you'll encounter investors who describe themselves as
"valuation sensitive."  What this means in practice is that they
are compulsive negotiators who will suck up a lot of your time
trying to push your price down.  You should therefore never approach
such investors first. While you shouldn't chase high valuations,
you also don't want your valuation to be set artificially low because
the first investor who committed happened to be a compulsive
negotiator.  Some such investors have value, but the time to approach
them is near the end of fundraising, when you're in a position to
say "this is the price everyone else has paid; take it or leave it"
and not mind if they leave it.  This way, you'll not only get market
price, but it will also take less time.<br><br>Ideally you know which investors have a reputation for being
"valuation sensitive" and can postpone dealing with them till last,
but occasionally one you didn't know about will pop up early on.
The rule of doing breadth first search weighted by expected value
already tells you what to do in this case: slow down your interactions
with them.<br><br>There are a handful of investors who will try to invest at a lower
valuation even when your price has already been set.  Lowering your
price is a backup plan you resort to when you discover you've let
the price get set too high to close all the money you need.  So
you'd only want to talk to this sort of investor if you were about
to do that anyway.  But since investor meetings have to be arranged
at least a few days in advance and you can't predict when you'll
need to resort to lowering your price, this means in practice that
you should approach this type of investor last if at all.<br><br>If you're surprised by a lowball offer, treat it as a backup offer
and delay responding to it.  When someone makes an offer in good
faith, you have a moral obligation to respond in a reasonable time.
But lowballing you is a dick move that should be met with the
corresponding countermove.<br><br>
<b>Accept offers greedily.</b><br><br>I'm a little leery of using the term "greedily" when writing about
fundraising lest non-programmers misunderstand me, but a greedy
algorithm is simply one that doesn't try to look into the future.
A greedy algorithm takes the best of the options in front of it
right now.  And that is how startups should approach fundraising
in phases 2 and later.  Don't try to look into the future because
(a) the future is unpredictable, and indeed in this business you're
often being deliberately misled about it and (b) your first priority
in fundraising should be to get it finished and get back to work
anyway.<br><br>If someone makes you an acceptable offer, take it.  If you have
multiple incompatible offers, take the best.  Don't reject an
acceptable offer in the hope of getting a better one in the future.<br><br>These simple rules cover a wide variety of cases.  If you're raising
money from many investors, roll them up as they say yes.  As you
start to feel you've raised enough, the threshold for acceptable
will start to get higher.<br><br>In practice offers exist for stretches of time, not points.  So
when you get an acceptable offer that would be incompatible with
others (e.g. an offer to invest most of the money you need), you
can tell the other investors you're talking to that you have an
offer good enough to accept, and give them a few days to make their
own.  This could lose you some that might have made an offer if
they had more time.  But by definition you don't care; the initial
offer was acceptable.<br><br>Some investors will try to prevent others from having time to decide
by giving you an "exploding" offer, meaning one that's only valid
for a few days.  Offers from the very best investors explode less
frequently and less rapidly — Fred Wilson never gives exploding
offers, for example — because they're confident you'll pick
them.  But lower-tier investors sometimes give offers with very
short fuses, because they believe no one who had other options would
choose them.  A deadline of three working days is acceptable.  You
shouldn't need more than that if you've been talking to investors
in parallel.  But a deadline any shorter is a sign you're dealing
with a sketchy investor.  You can usually call their bluff, and you
may need to.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f22n"><font color="#999999">22</font></a>]</font><br><br>It might seem that instead of accepting offers greedily, your goal
should be to get the best investors as partners.  That is certainly
a good goal, but in phase 2 "get the best investors" only rarely
conflicts with "accept offers greedily," because the best investors
don't usually take any longer to decide than the others.  The only
case where the two strategies give conflicting advice is when you
have to forgo an offer from an acceptable investor to see if you'll
get an offer from a better one.  If you talk to investors in parallel
and push back on exploding offers with excessively short deadlines,
that will almost never happen.  But if it does, "get the best
investors" is in the average case bad advice.  The best investors
are also the most selective, because they get their pick of all the
startups.  They reject nearly everyone they talk to, which means
in the average case it's a bad trade to exchange a definite offer
from an acceptable investor for a potential offer from a better
one.<br><br>(The situation is different in phase 1.  You can't apply to all the
incubators in parallel, because some offset their schedules to
prevent this.  In phase 1, "accept offers greedily" and "get the
best investors" do conflict, so if you want to apply to multiple
incubators, you should do it in such a way that the ones you want
most decide first.)<br><br>Sometimes when you're raising money from multiple investors, a
series A will emerge out of those conversations, and these rules
even cover what to do in that case.  When an investor starts to
talk to you about a series A, keep taking smaller investments till
they actually give you a termsheet.  There's no practical difficulty.
If the smaller investments are on convertible notes, they'll just
convert into the series A round.  The series A investor won't like
having all these other random investors as bedfellows, but if it
bothers them so much they should get on with giving you a termsheet.
Till they do, you don't know for sure they will, and the greedy
algorithm tells you what to do.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f23n"><font color="#999999">23</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Don't sell more than 25% in phase 2.</b><br><br>If you do well, you will probably raise a series A round eventually.
I say probably because things are changing with series A rounds.
Startups may start to skip them.  But only one company we've funded
has so far, so tentatively assume the path to huge passes through
an A round.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f24n"><font color="#999999">24</font></a>]</font><br><br>Which means you should avoid doing things in earlier rounds that
will mess up raising an A round.  For example, if you've sold more
than about 40% of your company total, it starts to get harder to
raise an A round, because VCs worry there will not be enough stock
left to keep the founders motivated.<br><br>Our rule of thumb is not to sell more than 25% in phase 2, on top
of whatever you sold in phase 1, which should be less than 15%.  If
you're raising money on uncapped notes, you'll have to guess what
the eventual equity round valuation might be.  Guess conservatively.<br><br>(Since the goal of this rule is to avoid messing up the series A,
there's obviously an exception if you end up raising a series A in
phase 2, as a handful of startups do.)<br><br>
<b>Have one person handle fundraising.</b><br><br>If you have multiple founders, pick one to handle fundraising so
the other(s) can keep working on the company.  And since the danger
of fundraising is not the time taken up by the actual meetings but
that it becomes the top idea in your mind, the founder who handles
fundraising should make a conscious effort to insulate the other
founder(s) from the details of the process.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f25n"><font color="#999999">25</font></a>]</font><br><br>(If the founders mistrust one another, this could cause some friction.
But if the founders mistrust one another, you have worse problems
to worry about than how to organize fundraising.)<br><br>The founder who handles fundraising should be the CEO, who should
in turn be the most formidable of the founders.  Even if the CEO
is a programmer and another founder is a salesperson?  Yes.  If you
happen to be that type of founding team, you're effectively a single
founder when it comes to fundraising.<br><br>It's ok to bring all the founders to meet an investor who will
invest a lot, and who needs this meeting as the final step before
deciding.  But wait till that point.  Introducing an investor to
your cofounder(s) should be like introducing a girl/boyfriend to
your parents — something you do only when things reach a certain
stage of seriousness.<br><br>Even if there are still one or more founders focusing on the company
during fundraising, growth will slow.  But try to get as much growth
as you can, because fundraising is a segment of time, not a point,
and what happens to the company during that time affects the outcome.
If your numbers grow significantly between two investor meetings,
investors will be hot to close, and if your numbers are flat or
down they'll start to get cold feet.<br><br>
<b>You'll need an executive summary and (maybe) a deck.</b><br><br>Traditionally phase 2 fundraising consists of presenting a slide
deck in person to investors.  Sequoia describes what such a deck
should <a href="http://www.sequoiacap.com/ideas">contain</a>, and
since they're the customer you can take their word for it.<br><br>I say "traditionally" because I'm ambivalent about decks, and (though
perhaps this is wishful thinking) they seem to be on the way out.
A lot of the most successful startups we fund never make decks in
phase 2.  They just talk to investors and explain what they plan
to do.  Fundraising usually takes off fast for the startups that
are most successful at it, and they're thus able to excuse themselves
by saying that they haven't had time to make a deck.<br><br>You'll also want an executive summary, which should be no more than
a page long and describe in the most matter of fact language what
you plan to do, why it's a good idea, and what progress you've made
so far.  The point of the summary is to remind the investor (who
may have met many startups that day) what you talked about.<br><br>Assume that if you give someone a copy of your deck or executive
summary, it will be passed on to whoever you'd least like to have
it.  But don't refuse on that account to give copies to investors
you meet.  You just have to treat such leaks as a cost of doing
business.  In practice it's not that high a cost.  Though founders
are rightly indignant when their plans get leaked to competitors,
I can't think of a startup whose outcome has been affected by it.<br><br>Sometimes an investor will ask you to send them your deck and/or
executive summary before they decide whether to meet with you.  I
wouldn't do that.  It's a sign they're not really interested.<br><br>
<b>Stop fundraising when it stops working.</b><br><br>When do you stop fundraising?  Ideally when you've raised enough.
But what if you haven't raised as much as you'd like?  When do you
give up?<br><br>It's hard to give general advice about this, because there have
been cases of startups that kept trying to raise money even when
it seemed hopeless, and miraculously succeeded. But what I usually
tell founders is to stop fundraising when you start to get a lot
of air in the straw.  When you're drinking through a straw, you can
tell when you get to the end of the liquid because you start to get
a lot of air in the straw.  When your fundraising options run out,
they usually run out in the same way.  Don't keep sucking on the
straw if you're just getting air.  It's not going to get better.<br><br>
<b>Don't get addicted to fundraising.</b><br><br>Fundraising is a chore for most founders, but some find it more
interesting than working on their startup.  The work at an early
stage startup often consists of unglamorous <a href="schlep.html">schleps</a>.  Whereas fundraising, when it's
going well, can be quite the opposite.  Instead of sitting in your
grubby apartment listening to users complain about bugs in your
software, you're being offered millions of dollars by famous investors
over lunch at a nice restaurant.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f26n"><font color="#999999">26</font></a>]</font><br><br>The danger of fundraising is particularly acute for people who are
good at it.  It's always fun to work on something you're good at.
If you're one of these people, beware.  Fundraising is not what
will make your company successful.  Listening to users complain
about bugs in your software is what will make you successful.  And
the big danger of getting addicted to fundraising is not merely
that you'll spend too long on it or raise too much money.  It's
that you'll start to think of yourself as being already successful,
and lose your taste for the schleps you need to undertake to actually
be successful.  Startups can be destroyed by this.<br><br>When I see a startup with young founders that is fabulously successful
at fundraising, I mentally decrease my estimate of the probability
that they'll succeed.  The press may be writing about them as if
they'd been anointed as the next Google, but I'm thinking "this is
going to end badly."<br><br>
<b>Don't raise too much.</b><br><br>Though only a handful of startups have to worry about this, it is
possible to raise too much.  The dangers of raising too much are
subtle but insidious.  One is that it will set impossibly high
expectations.  If you raise an excessive amount of money, it will
be at a high valuation, and the danger of raising money at too high
a valuation is that you won't be able to increase it sufficiently
the next time you raise money.<br><br>A company's valuation is expected to rise each time it raises money.
If not it's a sign of a company in trouble, which makes you
unattractive to investors.  So if you raise money in phase 2 at a
post-money valuation of $30 million, the pre-money valuation of
your next round, if you want to raise one, is going to have to be
at least $50 million.  And you have to be doing really, really well
to raise money at $50 million.<br><br>It's very dangerous to let the competitiveness of your current round
set the performance threshold you have to meet to raise your next
one, because the two are only loosely coupled.<br><br>But the money itself may be more dangerous than the valuation.  The
more you raise, the more you spend, and spending a lot of money can
be disastrous for an early stage startup.  Spending a lot makes it
harder to become profitable, and perhaps even worse, it makes you
more rigid, because the main way to spend money is people, and the
more people you have, the harder it is to change directions.  So
if you do raise a huge amount of money, don't spend it.  (You will
find that advice almost impossible to follow, so hot will be the
money burning a hole in your pocket, but I feel obliged at least
to try.)<br><br>
<b>Be nice.</b><br><br>Startups raising money occasionally alienate investors by seeming
arrogant.  Sometimes because they are arrogant, and sometimes because
they're noobs clumsily attempting to mimic the toughness they've
observed in experienced founders.<br><br>It's a mistake to behave arrogantly to investors.  While there are
certain situations in which certain investors like certain kinds
of arrogance, investors vary greatly in this respect, and a flick
of the whip that will bring one to heel will make another roar with
indignation.  The only safe strategy is never to seem arrogant at
all.<br><br>That will require some diplomacy if you follow the advice I've given
here, because the advice I've given is essentially how to play
hardball back.  When you refuse to meet an investor because you're
not in fundraising mode, or slow down your interactions with an
investor who moves too slow, or treat a contingent offer as the no
it actually is and then, by accepting offers greedily, end up leaving
that investor out, you're going to be doing things investors don't
like.  So you must cushion the blow with soft words.  At YC we tell
startups they can blame us.  And now that I've written this, everyone
else can blame me if they want.  That plus the inexperience card
should work in most situations: sorry, we think you're great, but
PG said startups shouldn't ___, and since we're new to fundraising,
we feel like we have to play it safe.<br><br>The danger of behaving arrogantly is greatest when you're doing
well.  When everyone wants you, it's hard not to let it go to your
head.  Especially if till recently no one wanted you.  But restrain
yourself.  The startup world is a small place, and startups have
lots of ups and downs.  This is a domain where it's more true than
usual that pride goeth before a fall.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f27n"><font color="#999999">27</font></a>]</font><br><br>Be nice when investors reject you as well.  The best investors are
not wedded to their initial opinion of you.  If they reject you in
phase 2 and you end up doing well, they'll often invest in phase
3.  In fact investors who reject you are some of your warmest leads
for future fundraising.  Any investor who spent significant time
deciding probably came close to saying yes.  Often you have some
internal champion who only needs a little more evidence to convince
the skeptics.  So it's wise not merely to be nice to investors who
reject you, but (unless they behaved badly) to treat it as the
beginning of a relationship.<br><br>
<b>The bar will be higher next time.</b><br><br>Assume the money you raise in phase 2 will be the last you ever
raise.  You must make it to profitability on this money if you can.<br><br>Over the past several years, the investment community has evolved
from a strategy of anointing a small number of winners early and
then supporting them for years to a strategy of spraying money at
early stage startups and then ruthlessly culling them at the next
stage.  This is probably the optimal strategy for investors.  It's
too hard to pick winners early on.  Better to let the market do it
for you.  But it often comes as a surprise to startups how much
harder it is to raise money in phase 3.<br><br>When your company is only a couple months old, all it has to be is
a promising experiment that's worth funding to see how it turns
out.  The next time you raise money, the experiment has to have
worked.  You have to be on a trajectory that leads to going public.
And while there are some ideas where the proof that the experiment
worked might consist of e.g. query response times, usually the proof
is profitability.  Usually phase 3 fundraising has to be type A
fundraising.<br><br>In practice there are two ways startups hose themselves between
phases 2 and 3.  Some are just too slow to become profitable.  They
raise enough money to last for two years.  There doesn't seem any
particular urgency to be profitable.  So they don't make any effort
to make money for a year.  But by that time, not making money has
become habitual.  When they finally decide to try, they find they
can't.<br><br>The other way companies hose themselves is by letting their expenses
grow too fast.  Which almost always means hiring too many people.
You usually shouldn't go out and hire 8 people as soon as you raise
money at phase 2.  Usually you want to wait till you have growth
(and thus usually revenues) to justify them.  A lot of VCs will
encourage you to hire aggressively.  VCs generally tell you to spend
too much, partly because as money people they err on the side of
solving problems by spending money, and partly because they want
you to sell them more of your company in subsequent rounds.  Don't
listen to them.<br><br>
<b>Don't make things complicated.</b><br><br>I realize it may seem odd to sum up this huge treatise by saying
that my overall advice is not to make fundraising too complicated,
but if you go back and look at this list you'll see it's basically
a simple recipe with a lot of implications and edge cases.  Avoid
investors till you decide to raise money, and then when you do,
talk to them all in parallel, prioritized by expected value, and
accept offers greedily.  That's fundraising in one sentence.  Don't
introduce complicated optimizations, and don't let investors introduce
complications either.<br><br>Fundraising is not what will make you successful.  It's just a means
to an end.  Your primary goal should be to get it over with and get
back to what will make you successful — making things and talking
to users — and the path I've described will for most startups
be the surest way to that destination.<br><br>Be good, take care of yourselves, and <i>don't leave the path</i>.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
The worst explosions happen when unpromising-seeming startups
encounter mediocre investors.  Good investors don't lead startups
on; their reputations are too valuable.  And startups that seem
promising can usually get enough money from good investors that
they don't have to talk to mediocre ones.  It is the unpromising-seeming
startups that have to resort to raising money from mediocre investors.
And it's particularly damaging when these investors flake, because
unpromising-seeming startups are usually more desperate for money.<br><br>(Not all unpromising-seeming startups do badly.  Some are merely
ugly ducklings in the sense that they violate current startup
fashions.)<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
One YC founder told me:
</p><blockquote>
  I think in general we've done ok at fundraising, but I managed
  to screw up twice at the exact same thing — trying to focus
  on building the company and fundraising at the same time.
</blockquote>
[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
There is one subtle danger you have to watch out for here, which
I warn about later: beware of getting too high a valuation from an
eager investor, lest that set an impossibly high target when raising
additional money.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
If they really need a meeting, then they're not ready to invest,
regardless of what they say. They're still deciding, which means
you're being asked to come in and convince them. Which is fundraising.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Associates at VC firms regularly cold email startups.  Naive
founders think "Wow, a VC is interested in us!"  But an associate
is not a VC.  They have no decision-making power.  And while they
may introduce startups they like to partners at their firm, the
partners discriminate against deals that come to them this way.   I
don't know of a single VC investment that began with an associate
cold-emailing a startup.  If you want to approach a specific firm,
get an intro to a partner from someone they respect.<br><br>It's ok to talk to an associate if you get an intro to a VC firm
or they see you at a Demo Day and they begin by having an associate
vet you.  That's not a promising lead and should therefore get low
priority, but it's not as completely worthless as a cold email.<br><br>Because the title "associate" has gotten a bad reputation, a few
VC firms have started to give their associates the title "partner,"
which can make things very confusing.  If you're a YC startup you
can ask us who's who; otherwise you may have to do some research
online.  There may be a special title for actual partners.  If
someone speaks for the firm in the press or a blog on the firm's
site, they're probably a real partner.  If they're on boards of
directors they're probably a real partner.<br><br>There are titles between "associate" and "partner," including
"principal" and "venture partner."  The meanings of these titles
vary too much to generalize.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
For similar reasons, avoid casual conversations with potential
acquirers.  They can lead to distractions even more dangerous than
fundraising.  Don't even take a meeting with a potential acquirer
unless you want to sell your company right now.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Joshua Reeves specifically suggests asking each investor to
intro you to two more investors.<br><br>Don't ask investors who say no for introductions to other investors.
That will in many cases be an anti-recommendation.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
This is not always as deliberate as its sounds.  A lot of the
delays and disconnects between founders and investors are induced
by the customs of the venture business, which have evolved the way
they have because they suit investors' interests.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
One YC founder who read a draft of this essay wrote:
<blockquote>
  This is the most important section. I think it might bear stating
  even more clearly. "Investors will deliberately affect more
  interest than they have to preserve optionality. If an investor
  seems very interested in you, they still probably won't invest.
  The solution for this is to assume the worst — that an investor
  is just feigning interest — until you get a definite commitment."
</blockquote>
[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
Though you should probably pack investor meetings as closely
as you can, Jeff Byun mentions one reason not to: if you pack
investor meetings too closely, you'll have less time for your pitch
to evolve.<br><br>Some founders deliberately schedule a handful of lame investors
first, to get the bugs out of their pitch.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
There is not an efficient market in this respect.  Some of the
most useless investors are also the highest maintenance.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
Incidentally, this paragraph is sales 101.  If you want to see
it in action, go talk to a car dealer.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
I know one very smooth founder who used to end investor meetings
with "So, can I count you in?" delivered as if it were "Can you
pass the salt?"   Unless you're very smooth (if you're not sure...),
do not do this yourself.  There is nothing more unconvincing, for
an investor, than a nerdy founder trying to deliver the lines meant
for a smooth one.<br><br>Investors are fine with funding nerds.  So if you're a nerd, just
try to be a good nerd, rather than doing a bad imitation of a smooth
salesman.<br><br>[<a name="f14n"><font color="#000000">14</font></a>]
Ian Hogarth suggests a good way to tell how serious potential
investors are: the resources they expend on you after the first
meeting.  An investor who's seriously interested will already be
working to help you even before they've committed.<br><br>[<a name="f15n"><font color="#000000">15</font></a>]
In principle you might have to think about so-called "signalling
risk."  If a prestigious VC makes a small seed investment in you,
what if they don't want to invest the next time you raise money?
Other investors might assume that the VC knows you well, since
they're an existing investor, and if they don't want to invest in
your next round, that must mean you suck.  The reason I say "in
principle" is that in practice signalling hasn't been much of a
problem so far.  It rarely arises, and in the few cases where it
does, the startup in question usually is doing badly and is doomed
anyway.<br><br>If you have the luxury of choosing among seed investors, you can
play it safe by excluding VC firms.  But it isn't critical to.<br><br>[<a name="f16n"><font color="#000000">16</font></a>]
Sometimes a competitor will deliberately threaten you with a
lawsuit just as you start fundraising, because they know you'll
have to disclose the threat to potential investors and they hope
this will make it harder for you to raise money.  If this happens
it will probably frighten you more than investors.  Experienced
investors know about this trick, and know the actual lawsuits rarely
happen. So if you're attacked in this way, be forthright with
investors.  They'll be more alarmed if you seem evasive than if you
tell them everything.<br><br>[<a name="f17n"><font color="#000000">17</font></a>]
A related trick is to claim that they'll only invest contingently
on other investors doing so because otherwise you'd be "undercapitalized."
This is almost always bullshit.  They can't estimate your minimum
capital needs that precisely.<br><br>[<a name="f18n"><font color="#000000">18</font></a>]
You won't hire all those 20 people at once, and you'll probably
have some revenues before 18 months are out.  But those too are
acceptable or at least accepted additions to the margin for error.<br><br>[<a name="f19n"><font color="#000000">19</font></a>]
Type A fundraising is so much better that it might even be
worth doing something different if it gets you there sooner.  One
YC founder told me that if he were a first-time founder again he'd
"leave ideas that are up-front capital intensive to founders with
established reputations."<br><br>[<a name="f20n"><font color="#000000">20</font></a>]
I don't know whether this happens because they're innumerate,
or because they believe they have zero ability to predict startup
outcomes (in which case this behavior at least wouldn't be irrational).
In either case the implications are similar.<br><br>[<a name="f21n"><font color="#000000">21</font></a>]
If you're a YC startup and you have an investor who for some
reason insists that you decide the price, any YC partner can estimate
a market price for you.<br><br>[<a name="f22n"><font color="#000000">22</font></a>]
You should respond in kind when investors behave upstandingly
too.  When an investor makes you a clean offer with no deadline,
you have a moral obligation to respond promptly.<br><br>[<a name="f23n"><font color="#000000">23</font></a>]
Tell the investors talking to you about an A round about the
smaller investments you raise as you raise them.  You owe them such
updates on your cap table, and this is also a good way to pressure
them to act.  They won't like you raising other money and may
pressure you to stop, but they can't legitimately ask you to commit
to them till they also commit to you.  If they want you to stop
raising money, the way to do it is to give you a series A termsheet
with a no-shop clause.<br><br>You can relent a little if the potential series A investor has a
great reputation and they're clearly working fast to get you a
termsheet, particularly if a third party like YC is involved to
ensure there are no misunderstandings.  But be careful.<br><br>[<a name="f24n"><font color="#000000">24</font></a>]
The company is Weebly, which made it to profitability on a
seed investment of $650k.  They did try to raise a series A in the
fall of 2008 but (no doubt partly because it was the fall of 2008)
the terms they were offered were so bad that they decided to skip
raising an A round.<br><br>[<a name="f25n"><font color="#000000">25</font></a>]
Another advantage of having one founder take fundraising
meetings is that you never have to negotiate in real time, which
is something inexperienced founders should avoid.  One YC founder
told me:
<blockquote>
  Investors are professional negotiators and can negotiate on the
  spot very easily.  If only one founder is in the room, you can
  say "I need to circle back with my co-founder" before making any
  commitments. I used to do this all the time.
</blockquote>
[<a name="f26n"><font color="#000000">26</font></a>]
You'll be lucky if fundraising feels pleasant enough to become
addictive.  More often you have to worry about the other
extreme — becoming demoralized when investors reject you.  As
one (very successful) YC founder wrote after reading a draft of
this:
<blockquote>
  It's hard to mentally deal with the sheer scale of rejection in
  fundraising and if you are not in the right mindset you will fail.
  Users may love you but these supposedly smart investors may not
  understand you at all. At this point for me, rejection still
  rankles but I've come to accept that investors are just not super
  thoughtful for the most part and you need to play the game according
  to certain somewhat depressing rules (many of which you are
  listing) in order to win.
</blockquote>

October 2014<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a guest lecture in Sam Altman's <a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/">startup class</a> at
Stanford.  It's intended for college students, but much of it is
applicable to potential founders at other ages.)</i><br><br>One of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to give
advice, you can ask yourself "what would I tell my own kids?"  My
kids are little, but I can imagine what I'd tell them about startups
if they were in college, and that's what I'm going to tell you.<br><br>Startups are very counterintuitive.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe it's
just because knowledge about them hasn't permeated our culture yet.
But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you
can't always trust your instincts.<br><br>It's like skiing in that way.  When you first try skiing and you
want to slow down, your instinct is to lean back.  But if you lean
back on skis you fly down the hill out of control.  So part of
learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse.  Eventually
you get new habits, but at first it takes a conscious effort.  At
first there's a list of things you're trying to remember as you
start down the hill.<br><br>Startups are as unnatural as skiing, so there's a similar list for
startups. Here I'm going to give you the first part of it — the things
to remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup.<br><br>
<b>Counterintuitive</b><br><br>The first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups
are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot
of mistakes.  If you know nothing more than this, you may at least
pause before making them.<br><br>When I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our function
was to tell founders things they would ignore.  It's really true.
Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about mistakes
they're about to make, and the founders ignore them, and then come
back a year later and say "I wish we'd listened."<br><br>Why do the founders ignore the partners' advice?  Well, that's the
thing about counterintuitive ideas: they contradict your intuitions.
They seem wrong.  So of course your first impulse is to disregard
them.  And in fact my joking description is not merely the curse
of Y Combinator but part of its raison d'etre. If founders' instincts
already gave them the right answers, they wouldn't need us.  You
only need other people to give you advice that surprises you. That's
why there are a lot of ski instructors and not many running
instructors.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>You can, however, trust your instincts about people.  And in fact
one of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to
do that enough.  They get involved with people who seem impressive,
but about whom they feel some misgivings personally.  Later when
things blow up they say "I knew there was something off about him,
but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive."<br><br>If you're thinking about getting involved with someone — as a
cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you
have misgivings about them, trust your gut.  If someone seems
slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don't ignore it.<br><br>This is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent. Work with
people you genuinely like, and you've known long enough to be sure.<br><br>
<b>Expertise</b><br><br>The second counterintuitive point is that it's not that important
to know a lot about startups.  The way to succeed in a startup is
not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users
and the problem you're solving for them.
Mark Zuckerberg didn't succeed because he was an expert on startups.
He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups, because he
understood his users really well.<br><br>If you don't know anything about, say, how to raise an angel round,
don't feel bad on that account.  That sort of thing you can learn
when you need to, and forget after you've done it.<br><br>In fact, I worry it's not merely unnecessary to learn in great
detail about the mechanics of startups, but possibly somewhat
dangerous.  If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible
notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I
wouldn't think "here is someone who is way ahead of their peers."
It would set off alarms.  Because another of the characteristic
mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting
a startup.  They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money
at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people.
From the outside that seems like what startups do.  But the next
step after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually
realize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all
the outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thing
that's actually essential: making something people want.<br><br>
<b>Game</b><br><br>We saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing
house.  Eventually I realized why it was happening.  The reason
young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is
because that's what they've been trained to do for their whole lives
up to that point.  Think about what you have to do to get into
college, for example.  Extracurricular activities, check.  Even in
college classes most of the work is as artificial as running laps.<br><br>I'm not attacking the educational system for being this way. There
will always be a certain amount of fakeness in the work you do when
you're being taught something, and if you measure their performance
it's inevitable that people will exploit the difference to the point
where much of what you're measuring is artifacts of the fakeness.<br><br>I confess I did it myself in college. I found that in a lot of
classes there might only be 20 or 30 ideas that were the right shape
to make good exam questions.  The way I studied for exams in these
classes was not (except incidentally) to master the material taught
in the class, but to make a list of potential exam questions and
work out the answers in advance. When I walked into the final, the
main thing I'd be feeling was curiosity about which of my questions
would turn up on the exam.  It was like a game.<br><br>It's not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives
to play such games, young founders' first impulse on starting a
startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new
game. Since fundraising appears to be the measure of success for
startups (another classic noob mistake), they always want to know what the
tricks are for convincing investors.  We tell them the best way to
<a href="convince.html">convince investors</a> is to make a startup
that's actually doing well, meaning <a href="growth.html">growing fast</a>, and then simply
tell investors so.  Then they want to know what the tricks are for
growing fast.  And we have to tell them the best way to do that is
simply to make something people want.<br><br>So many of the conversations YC partners have with young founders
begin with the founder asking "How do we..." and the partner replying
"Just..."<br><br>Why do the founders always make things so complicated?  The reason,
I realized, is that they're looking for the trick.<br><br>So this is the third counterintuitive thing to remember about
startups: starting a startup is where gaming the system stops
working.  Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work
for a big company. Depending on how broken the company is, you can
succeed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impression
of productivity, and so on. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
But that doesn't work with startups.
There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is
whether your product does what they want. Startups are as impersonal
as physics.  You have to make something people want, and you prosper
only to the extent you do.<br><br>The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors.
If you're super good at sounding like you know what you're talking
about, you can fool investors for at least one and perhaps even two
rounds of funding.  But it's not in your interest to.  The company
is ultimately doomed.  All you're doing is wasting your own time
riding it down.<br><br>So stop looking for the trick. There are tricks in startups, as
there are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less
important than solving the real problem. A founder who knows nothing
about fundraising but has made something users love will have an
easier time raising money than one who knows every trick in the
book but has a flat usage graph. And more importantly, the founder
who has made something users love is the one who will go on to
succeed after raising the money.<br><br>Though in a sense it's bad news in that you're deprived of one of
your most powerful weapons, I think it's exciting that gaming the
system stops working when you start a startup.  It's exciting that
there even exist parts of the world where you win by doing good
work.  Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were all
like school and big companies, where you either have to spend a lot
of time on bullshit things or lose to people who do.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
I would
have been delighted if I'd realized in college that there were parts
of the real world where gaming the system mattered less than others,
and a few where it hardly mattered at all.  But there are, and this
variation is one of the most important things to consider when
you're thinking about your future.  How do you win in each type of
work, and what would you like to win by doing?
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>All-Consuming</b><br><br>That brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point: startups are
all-consuming.  If you start a startup, it will take over your life
to a degree you cannot imagine.  And if your startup succeeds, it
will take over your life for a long time: for several years at the
very least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your working
life.  So there is a real opportunity cost here.<br><br>Larry Page may seem to have an enviable life, but there are aspects
of it that are unenviable.  Basically at 25 he started running as
fast as he could and it must seem to him that he hasn't stopped to
catch his breath since.  Every day new shit happens in the Google
empire that only the CEO can deal with, and he, as CEO, has to deal
with it.  If he goes on vacation for even a week, a whole week's
backlog of shit accumulates.  And he has to bear this uncomplainingly,
partly because as the company's daddy he can never show fear or
weakness, and partly because billionaires get less than zero sympathy
if they talk about having difficult lives.  Which has the strange
side effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder
is concealed from almost everyone except those who've done it.<br><br>Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called
big successes, and in every single case the founders say the same
thing.  It never gets any easier.  The nature of the problems change.
You're worrying about construction delays at your London office
instead of the broken air conditioner in your studio apartment.
But the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything it
increases.<br><br>Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids in that
it's like a button you push that changes your life irrevocably.
And while it's truly wonderful having kids, there are a lot of
things that are easier to do before you have them than after.  Many
of which will make you a better parent when you do have kids. And
since you can delay pushing the button for a while, most people in
rich countries do.<br><br>Yet when it comes to startups, a lot of people seem to think they're
supposed to start them while they're still in college.  Are you
crazy?  And what are the universities thinking?  They go out of
their way to ensure their students are well supplied with contraceptives,
and yet they're setting up entrepreneurship programs and startup
incubators left and right.<br><br>To be fair, the universities have their hand forced here.  A lot
of incoming students are interested in startups.  Universities are,
at least de facto, expected to prepare them for their careers.  So
students who want to start startups hope universities can teach
them about startups.  And whether universities can do this or not,
there's some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose applicants
to other universities that do.<br><br>Can universities teach students about startups?  Yes and no.  They
can teach students about startups, but as I explained before, this
is not what you need to know.  What you need to learn about are the
needs of your own users, and you can't do that until you actually
start the company.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
So starting a startup is intrinsically
something you can only really learn by doing it.  And it's impossible
to do that in college, for the reason I just explained: startups
take over your life.  You can't start a startup for real as a
student, because if you start a startup for real you're not a student
anymore. You may be nominally a student for a bit, but you won't even
be that for long.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Given this dichotomy, which of the two paths should you take?  Be
a real student and not start a startup, or start a real startup and
not be a student?  I can answer that one for you. Do not start a
startup in college.  How to start a startup is just a subset of a
bigger problem you're trying to solve: how to have a good life.
And though starting a startup can be part of a good life for a lot
of ambitious people, age 20 is not the optimal time to do it.
Starting a startup is like a brutally fast depth-first search.  Most
people should still be searching breadth-first at 20.<br><br>You can do things in your early 20s that you can't do as well before
or after, like plunge deeply into projects on a whim and travel
super cheaply with no sense of a deadline.  For unambitious people,
this sort of thing is the dreaded "failure to launch," but for the
ambitious ones it can be an incomparably valuable sort of exploration.
If you start a startup at 20 and you're sufficiently successful,
you'll never get to do it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country.  He
can do other things most people can't, like charter jets to fly him
to foreign countries. But success has taken a lot of the serendipity
out of his life. Facebook is running him as much as he's running
Facebook. And while it can be very cool to be in the grip of a
project you consider your life's work, there are advantages to
serendipity too, especially early in life.  Among other things it
gives you more options to choose your life's work from.<br><br>There's not even a tradeoff here. You're not sacrificing anything
if you forgo starting a startup at 20, because you're more likely
to succeed if you wait.  In the unlikely case that you're 20 and
one of your side projects takes off like Facebook did, you'll face
a choice of running with it or not, and it may be reasonable to run
with it.  But the usual way startups take off is for the founders
to <a href="ds.html">make them</a> take off, and it's gratuitously
stupid to do that at 20.<br><br>
<b>Try</b><br><br>Should you do it at any age?  I realize I've made startups sound
pretty hard.  If I haven't, let me try again: starting a startup
is really hard.  What if it's too hard?  How can you tell if you're
up to this challenge?<br><br>The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can't tell. Your
life so far may have given you some idea what your prospects might
be if you tried to become a mathematician, or a professional football
player.  But unless you've had a very strange life you haven't done
much that was <a href="really.html">like</a> being a startup founder.
Starting a startup will change you a lot.  So what you're trying
to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into,
and who can do that?<br><br>For the past 9 years it was my job to predict whether people would
have what it took to start successful startups.  It was easy to
tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be over
that threshold.  The hard part was predicting how <xa href="relres.html">tough and ambitious they would become.  There
may be no one who has more experience at trying to predict that,
so I can tell you how much an expert can know about it, and the
answer is: not much.  I learned to keep a completely open mind about
which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.<br><br>The founders sometimes think they know. Some arrive feeling sure
they will ace Y Combinator just as they've aced every one of the (few,
artificial, easy) tests they've faced in life so far.  Others arrive
wondering how they got in, and hoping YC doesn't discover whatever
mistake caused it to accept them.  But there is little correlation
between founders' initial attitudes and how well their companies
do.<br><br>I've read that the same is true in the military — that the
swaggering recruits are no more likely to turn out to be really
tough than the quiet ones. And probably for the same reason: that
the tests involved are so different from the ones in their previous
lives.<br><br>If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably
shouldn't do it.  But if you're merely unsure whether you're up to
it, the only way to find out is to try.  Just not now.<br><br>
<b>Ideas</b><br><br>So if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do in
college?  There are only two things you need initially: an idea and
cofounders.  And the m.o. for getting both is the same.  Which leads
to our sixth and last counterintuitive point: that the way to get
startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.<br><br>I've written a whole <a href="startupideas.html">essay</a> on this,
so I won't repeat it all here.  But the short version is that if
you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideas
you come up with will not merely be bad, but bad and plausible-sounding,
meaning you'll waste a lot of time on them before realizing they're
bad.<br><br>The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back.
Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas,
turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any
conscious effort.  In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even
realize at first that they're startup ideas.<br><br>This is not only possible, it's how Apple, Yahoo, Google, and
Facebook all got started.  None of these companies were even meant
to be companies at first.  They were all just side projects.  The
best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great
ideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject
them as ideas for companies.<br><br>Ok, so how do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideas
form in unconsciously?  (1) Learn a lot about things that matter,
then (2) work on problems that interest you (3) with people you
like and respect.  The third part, incidentally, is how you get
cofounders at the same time as the idea.<br><br>The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of "learn a lot about
things that matter," I wrote "become good at some technology." But
that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow.  What was
special about Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia was not that they were
experts in technology.  They were good at design, and perhaps even
more importantly, they were good at organizing groups and making
projects happen.  So you don't have to work on technology per se,
so long as you work on problems demanding enough to stretch you.<br><br>What kind of problems are those?  That is very hard to answer in
the general case.  History is full of examples of young people who
were working on important problems that <a href="marginal.html">no
one else</a> at the time thought were important, and in particular
that their parents didn't think were important.  On the other hand,
history is even fuller of examples of parents who thought their
kids were wasting their time and who were right.  So how do you
know when you're working on real stuff?
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>I know how <i>I</i> know.  Real problems are interesting, and I am
self-indulgent in the sense that I always want to work on interesting
things, even if no one else cares about them (in fact, especially
if no one else cares about them), and find it very hard to make
myself work on boring things, even if they're supposed to be
important.<br><br>My life is full of case after case where I worked on something just
because it seemed interesting, and it turned out later to be useful
in some worldly way.  <a href="http://ycombinator.com/start.html">Y
Combinator itself</a> was something I only did because it seemed
interesting. So I seem to have some sort of internal compass that
helps me out.  But I don't know what other people have in their
heads. Maybe if I think more about this I can come up with heuristics
for recognizing genuinely interesting problems, but for the moment
the best I can offer is the hopelessly question-begging advice that
if you have a taste for genuinely interesting problems, indulging
it energetically is the best way to prepare yourself for a startup.
And indeed, probably also the best way to live.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>But although I can't explain in the general case what counts as an
interesting problem, I can tell you about a large subset of them.
If you think of technology as something that's spreading like a
sort of fractal stain, every moving point on the edge represents
an interesting problem.  So one guaranteed way to turn your mind
into the type that has good startup ideas is to get yourself to the
leading edge of some technology — to cause yourself, as Paul
Buchheit put it, to "live in the future." When you reach that point,
ideas that will seem to other people uncannily prescient will seem
obvious to you.  You may not realize they're startup ideas, but
you'll know they're something that ought to exist.<br><br>For example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad student
of my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice over IP software.
He didn't mean it to be a startup, and he never tried to turn it
into one.  He just wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan without
paying for long distance calls, and since he was an expert on
networks it seemed obvious to him that the way to do it was turn
the sound into packets and ship it over the Internet. He never did
any more with his software than talk to his girlfriend, but this
is exactly the way the best startups get started.<br><br>So strangely enough the optimal thing to do in college if you want
to be a successful startup founder is not some sort of new, vocational
version of college focused on "entrepreneurship." It's the classic
version of college as education for its own sake. If you want to
start a startup after college, what you should do in college is
learn powerful things.  And if you have genuine intellectual
curiosity, that's what you'll naturally tend to do if you just
follow your own inclinations.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain
expertise.  The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert
on search. And the way to become an expert on search was to be
driven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.<br><br>At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for
curiosity.  And you'll do it best if you introduce the ulterior
motive toward the end of the process.<br><br>So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders,
boiled down to two words: just learn.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Some founders listen more than others, and this tends to be a
<a href="word.html">predictor of success</a>. One of the things I
remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In fact, this is one of the reasons startups are possible.  If
big companies weren't plagued by internal inefficiencies, they'd
be proportionately more effective, leaving less room for startups.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
In a startup you have to spend a lot of time on <a href="schlep.html">schleps</a>, but this sort of work is merely
unglamorous, not bogus.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
What should you do if your true calling is gaming the system?
Management consulting.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
The company may not be incorporated, but if you start to get
significant numbers of users, you've started it, whether you realize
it yet or not.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
It shouldn't be that surprising that colleges can't teach
students how to be good startup founders, because they can't teach
them how to be good employees either.<br><br>The way universities "teach" students how to be employees is to
hand off the task to companies via internship programs.  But you
couldn't do the equivalent thing for startups, because by definition
if the students did well they would never come back.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Charles Darwin was 22 when he received an invitation to travel
aboard the HMS Beagle as a naturalist.  It was only because he was
otherwise unoccupied, to a degree that alarmed his family, that he
could accept it. And yet if he hadn't we probably would not know
his name.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Parents can sometimes be especially conservative in this
department.  There are some whose definition of important problems
includes only those on the critical path to med school.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
I did manage to think of a heuristic for detecting whether you
have a taste for interesting ideas: whether you find known boring
ideas intolerable.  Could you endure studying literary theory, or
working in middle management at a large company?<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
In fact, if your goal is to start a startup, you can stick
even more closely to the ideal of a liberal education than past
generations have. Back when students focused mainly on getting a
job after college, they thought at least a little about how the
courses they took might look to an employer.  And perhaps even
worse, they might shy away from taking a difficult class lest they
get a low grade, which would harm their all-important GPA.  Good
news: users <a href="credentials.html">don't care</a> what your GPA
was.  And I've never heard of investors caring either.  Y Combinator
certainly never asks what classes you took in college or what grades
you got in them.<br><br>

are mean.  There are exceptions, but remarkably few.<br><br>Meanness isn't rare.  In fact, one of the things the internet has
shown us is how mean people can be.  A few decades ago, only famous
people and professional writers got to publish their opinions.  Now
everyone can, and we can all see the <xa href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpOEO2gUekE">long tail of
meanness that had previously been hidden.<br><br>And yet while there are clearly a lot of mean people out there,
there are next to none among the most successful people I know.
What's going on here?  Are meanness and success inversely correlated?<br><br>Part of what's going on, of course, is selection bias.  I only know
people who work in certain fields: startup founders, programmers,
professors. I'm willing to believe that successful people in other
fields are mean.  Maybe successful hedge fund managers are mean; I
don't know enough to say.  It seems quite likely that most successful
drug lords are mean.  But there are at least big chunks of the world
that mean people don't rule, and that territory seems to be growing.<br><br>My wife and Y Combinator cofounder Jessica is one of those rare
people who have x-ray vision for character. Being married to her
is like standing next to an airport baggage scanner. She came to
the startup world from investment banking, and she has always been
struck both by how consistently successful startup founders turn
out to be good people, and how consistently bad people fail as
startup founders.<br><br>Why?  I think there are several reasons.  One is that being mean
makes you stupid. That's why I hate fights. You never do your best
work in a fight, because fights are not sufficiently general.
Winning is always a function of the situation and the people involved.
You don't win fights by thinking of big ideas but by thinking of
tricks that work in one particular case.  And yet fighting is just
as much work as thinking about real problems. Which is particularly
painful to someone who cares how their brain is used: your brain
goes fast but you get nowhere, like a car spinning its wheels.<br><br>Startups don't win by attacking. They win by transcending. There
are exceptions of course, but usually the way to win is to race
ahead, not to stop and fight.<br><br>Another reason mean founders lose is that they can't get the best
people to work for them. They can hire people who will put up with
them because they need a job. But the best people have other options.
A mean person can't convince the best people to work for him unless
he is super convincing. And while having the best people helps any
organization, it's critical for startups.<br><br>There is also a complementary force at work: if you want to build
great things, it helps to be driven by a spirit of <xa href="good.html">benevolence. The startup founders who end up
richest are not the ones driven by money.  The ones driven by money
take the big acquisition offer that nearly every successful startup
gets en route.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
The ones who keep going are driven by something
else. They may not say so explicitly, but they're usually trying
to improve the world.  Which means people with a desire to improve
the world have a natural advantage.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The exciting thing is that startups are not just one random type
of work in which meanness and success are inversely correlated.
This kind of work is the future.<br><br>For most of history success meant control of scarce resources.  One
got that by fighting, whether literally in the case of pastoral
nomads driving hunter-gatherers into marginal lands, or metaphorically
in the case of Gilded Age financiers contending with one another
to assemble railroad monopolies. For most of history, success meant
success at zero-sum games. And in most of them meanness was not a
handicap but probably an advantage.<br><br>That is changing. Increasingly the games that matter are not zero-sum.
Increasingly you win not by fighting to get control of a scarce
resource, but by having new ideas and building new things.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>There have long been games where you won by having new ideas. In
the third century BC, Archimedes won by doing that. At least until
an invading Roman army killed him. Which illustrates why
this change is happening: for new ideas to matter, you need a certain
degree of civil order.  And not just not being at war.  You also
need to prevent the sort of economic violence that nineteenth century
magnates practiced against one another and communist countries
practiced against their citizens.  People need to feel that what
they create can't be stolen.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>That has always been the case for thinkers, which is why this trend
began with them.  When you think of successful people from history
who weren't ruthless, you get mathematicians and writers and artists.
The exciting thing is that their m.o. seems to be spreading.  The
games played by intellectuals are leaking into the real world, and
this is reversing the historical polarity of the relationship between
meanness and success.<br><br>So I'm really glad I stopped to think about this. Jessica and I
have always worked hard to teach our kids not to be mean.  We
tolerate noise and mess and junk food, but not meanness.  And now
I have both an additional reason to crack down on it, and an

I'm not saying all founders who take big acquisition offers
are driven only by money, but rather that those who don't aren't.
Plus one can have benevolent motives for being driven by money — for 
example, to take care of one's family, or to be free to work
on projects that improve the world.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
It's unlikely that every successful startup improves the
world.  But their founders, like parents, truly believe they do.
Successful founders are in love with their companies.  And while
this sort of love is as blind as the love people have for one
another, it is genuine.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
<a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec05">Peter 
Thiel</a> would point out that successful founders still
get rich from controlling monopolies, just monopolies they create
rather than ones they capture.  And while this is largely true, it
means a big change in the sort of person who wins.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
To be fair, the Romans didn't mean to kill Archimedes.  The
Roman commander specifically ordered that he be spared. But he got
killed in the chaos anyway.<br><br>In sufficiently disordered times, even thinking requires
control of scarce resources, because living at all is a scarce
resource.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Ron Conway, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris,

although they have a significant amount of money in the bank, they're
also losing a lot each month, and revenue growth is either nonexistent
or mediocre.  The company has, say, 6 months of runway.  Or to put
it more brutally, 6 months before they're out of business.  They
expect to avoid that by raising more from investors.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>That last sentence is the fatal one.<br><br>There may be nothing founders are so prone to delude themselves
about as how interested investors will be in giving them additional
funding.  It's hard to convince investors the first time too, but
founders expect that.  What bites them the second time is a confluence
of three forces:
<ol>
<li> The company is spending more now than it did the first time
  it raised money.<br><br></li><li> Investors have much higher standards for companies that have
  already raised money.<br><br></li><li> The company is now starting to read as a failure. The first
  time it raised money, it was neither a success nor a failure; it
  was too early to ask. Now it's possible to ask that question, and
  the default answer is failure, because at this point that is the
  default outcome.
</li></ol>
I'm going to call the situation I described in the first paragraph "the fatal pinch." I try to resist
coining phrases, but making up a name for this situation may snap
founders into realizing when they're in it.<br><br>One of the things that makes the fatal pinch so dangerous is
that it's self-reinforcing.  Founders overestimate their chances
of raising more money, and so are slack about reaching
profitability, which further decreases their chances of raising
money.<br><br>Now that you know about the fatal pinch, how do you avoid it?  Y&nbsp;Combinator tells
founders who raise money to act as if it's the last they'll ever
get.  Because the self-reinforcing nature of this situation works
the other way too: the less you need further investment, the easier
it is to get.<br><br>What do you do if you're already in the fatal pinch?  The
first step is to re-evaluate the probability of raising more money.
I will now, by an amazing feat of clairvoyance, do this for you:
the probability is zero. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Three options remain: you can shut down the company, you can increase
how much you make, and you can decrease how much you spend.<br><br>You should shut down the company if you're certain it will
fail no matter what you do.  Then at least you can give back the
money you have left, and save yourself however many months you would
have spent riding it down.<br><br>Companies rarely <i>have</i> to fail though.  What I'm really doing
here is giving you the option of admitting you've already given up.<br><br>If you don't want to shut down the company, that leaves increasing
revenues and decreasing expenses.  In most startups, expenses =
people, and decreasing expenses = firing people.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Deciding to
fire people is usually hard, but there's one case in which it
shouldn't be: when there are people you already know you should
fire but you're in denial about it.  If so, now's the time.<br><br>If that makes you profitable, or will enable you to make it to
profitability on the money you have left, you've avoided the immediate
danger.<br><br>Otherwise you have three options: you either have to fire good
people, get some or all of the employees to take less salary for a
while, or increase revenues.<br><br>Getting people to take less salary is a weak solution that will
only work when the problem isn't too bad.  If your current trajectory
won't quite get you to profitability but you can get over the threshold
by cutting salaries a little,
you might be able to make the case to everyone for doing it.
Otherwise you're probably just postponing the problem, and that
will be obvious to the people whose salaries you're proposing to
cut.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Which leaves two options, firing good people and making more money.
While trying to balance them, keep in mind the eventual goal: to be
a successful product company in the sense of having a single thing
lots of people use.<br><br>You should lean more toward firing people if the source of your
trouble is overhiring. If you went out and hired 15 people before
you even knew what you were building, you've created a broken
company.  You need to figure out what you're building, and it will
probably be easier to do that with a handful of people than 15.
Plus those 15 people might not even be the ones you need for whatever
you end up building.  So the solution may be to shrink and then
figure out what direction to grow in.  After all, you're not doing
those 15 people any favors if you fly the company into ground with
them aboard.  They'll all lose their jobs eventually, along with
all the time they expended on this doomed company.<br><br>Whereas if you only have a handful of people, it may be better to
focus on trying to make more money.  It may seem facile to suggest
a startup make more money, as if that could be done for the asking.
Usually a startup is already trying as hard as it can to sell
whatever it sells.  What I'm suggesting here is not so much to try
harder to make money but to try to make money in a different way.
For example, if you have only one person selling while the rest are
writing code, consider having everyone work on selling.  What good
will more code do you when you're out of business?  
If you have to write code to close a certain deal, go ahead;
that follows from everyone working on selling.  But only work on
whatever will get you the most revenue the soonest.<br><br>Another way to make money differently is to sell different things,
and in particular to do more consultingish work.  I say consultingish
because there is a long slippery slope from making products to pure
consulting, and you don't have to go far down it before you start
to offer something really attractive to customers. Although your
product may not be very appealing yet, if you're a startup your
programmers will often be way better than the ones your customers
have.  Or you may have expertise in some new field they
don't understand.  So if you change your sales conversations
just a little from "do you want to buy our product?" to "what do
you need that you'd pay a lot for?" you may find it's suddenly a
lot easier to extract money from customers.<br><br>Be ruthlessly mercenary when you start doing this, though. You're
trying to save your company from death here, so make customers pay
a lot, quickly. And to the extent you can, try to avoid the
worst pitfalls of consulting.  The ideal thing might be if you built
a precisely defined derivative version of your product for the
customer, and it was otherwise a straight product sale.  You keep
the IP and no billing by the hour.<br><br>In the best case, this consultingish work may not be just something
you do to survive, but may turn out to be the <a href="ds.html">thing-that-doesn't-scale</a> that defines your
company.  Don't expect it to be, but as you dive into individual
users' needs, keep your eyes open for narrow openings that have
wide vistas beyond.<br><br>There is usually so much demand for custom work that unless you're
really incompetent there has to be some point down the slope of
consulting at which you can survive.  But I didn't use the term
slippery slope by accident; customers' insatiable demand for custom
work will always be pushing you toward the bottom.  So while you'll
probably survive, the problem now becomes to survive with the least
damage and distraction.<br><br>The good news is, plenty of successful startups have passed through
near-death experiences and gone on to flourish.  You just have to
realize in time that you're near death.  And if you're in the fatal pinch,
you are.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
There are a handful of companies that can't reasonably expect
to make money for the first year or two, because what they're
building takes so long.  For these companies substitute "progress"
for "revenue growth."  You're not one of these companies unless
your initial investors agreed in advance that you were.  And frankly
even these companies wish they weren't, because the illiquidity of
"progress" puts them at the mercy of investors.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There's a variant of the fatal pinch where your existing
investors help you along by promising to invest more.  Or rather,
where you read them as promising to invest more, while they think
they're just mentioning the possibility.  The way to solve this
problem, if you have 8 months of runway or less, is to try to get
the money right now.  Then you'll either get the money, in which
case (immediate) problem solved, or at least prevent your investors
from helping you to remain in denial about your fundraising prospects.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Obviously, if you have significant expenses other than salaries
that you can eliminate, do it now.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Unless of course the source of the problem is that you're paying
yourselves high salaries.  If by cutting the founders' salaries to
the minimum you need, you can make it to profitability, you should.
But it's a bad sign if you needed to read this to realize that.<br><br>

two times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything
I remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a
page.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy
feeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all
these books if I remember so little from them?<br><br>A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent
biography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this
question, at least something that made me feel better about it.
She writes:
<blockquote>
  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled
  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a
  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that "a perfect
  formulation of a problem is already half its solution."
</blockquote>
That has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even
more convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.<br><br>But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A
combination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None
of which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget
that Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the
importance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from
this book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.<br><br>Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if
you forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model
of the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've
lost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.<br><br>The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle
is not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,
Venice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't
mean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest
of reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.<br><br>This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But
it was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who
felt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.<br><br>Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about
forgetting, though.  There are specific implications.<br><br>For example, reading and experience are usually "compiled" at the
time they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The
same book would get compiled differently at different points in
your life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important
books multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about
rereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work
like carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you
did it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase "already read"
seems almost ill-formed.<br><br>Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology
will increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When
people do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when
looking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in
their compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering
the childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as
technologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it
may become common for people to relive experiences without any goal
in mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading
a book.<br><br>Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but
also to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you
know things may seem part of being human, it may not be.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

confidence in our beliefs.  The more (and more varied) experience
a belief survived, the less likely it would be false.  Most people
implicitly believe something like this about their opinions.  And
they're justified in doing so with opinions about things that don't
change much, like human nature.  But you can't trust your opinions
in the same way about things that change, which could include
practically everything else.<br><br>When experts are wrong, it's often because they're experts on an
earlier version of the world.<br><br>Is it possible to avoid that?  Can you protect yourself against
obsolete beliefs?  To some extent, yes. I spent almost a decade
investing in early stage startups, and curiously enough protecting
yourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do
to succeed as a startup investor.  Most really good startup ideas
look like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically
because some change in the world just switched them from bad to
good.  I spent a lot of time learning to recognize such ideas, and
the techniques I used may be applicable to ideas in general.<br><br>The first step is to have an explicit belief in change.  People who
fall victim to a monotonically increasing confidence in their
opinions are implicitly concluding the world is static.  If you
consciously remind yourself it isn't, you start to look for change.<br><br>Where should one look for it?  Beyond the moderately useful
generalization that human nature doesn't change much, the unfortunate
fact is that change is hard to predict.  This is largely a tautology
but worth remembering all the same: change that matters usually
comes from an unforeseen quarter.<br><br>So I don't even try to predict it.  When I get asked in interviews
to predict the future, I always have to struggle to come up with
something plausible-sounding on the fly, like a student who hasn't
prepared for an exam.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
But it's not out of laziness that I haven't
prepared.  It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so
rarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigidity
they impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively
open-minded.  Instead of trying to point yourself in the right
direction, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, and
try instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change.<br><br>It's ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain
you a bit, because they also motivate you.  It's exciting to chase
things and exciting to try to guess answers.  But you have to be
disciplined about not letting your hypotheses harden into anything
more.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>I believe this passive m.o. works not just for evaluating new ideas
but also for having them.  The way to come up with new ideas is not
to try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply not
discount weird hunches you have in the process.<br><br>The winds of change originate in the unconscious minds of domain
experts.  If you're sufficiently expert in a field, any weird idea
or apparently irrelevant question that occurs to you is ipso facto
worth exploring. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
 Within Y Combinator, when an idea is described
as crazy, it's a compliment—in fact, on average probably a
higher compliment than when an idea is described as good.<br><br>Startup investors have extraordinary incentives for correcting
obsolete beliefs.  If they can realize before other investors that
some apparently unpromising startup isn't, they can make a huge
amount of money.  But the incentives are more than just financial.
Investors' opinions are explicitly tested: startups come to them
and they have to say yes or no, and then, fairly quickly, they learn
whether they guessed right.  The investors who say no to a Google
(and there were several) will remember it for the rest of their
lives.<br><br>Anyone who must in some sense bet on ideas rather than merely
commenting on them has similar incentives.  Which means anyone who
wants such incentives can have them, by turning their comments into
bets: if you write about a topic in some fairly durable and public
form, you'll find you worry much more about getting things right
than most people would in a casual conversation.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another trick I've found to protect myself against obsolete beliefs
is to focus initially on people rather than ideas. Though the nature
of future discoveries is hard to predict, I've found I can predict
quite well what sort of people will make them.  Good new ideas come
from earnest, energetic, independent-minded people.<br><br>Betting on people over ideas saved me countless times as an investor.
We thought Airbnb was a bad idea, for example. But we could tell
the founders were earnest, energetic, and independent-minded.
(Indeed, almost pathologically so.)  So we suspended disbelief and
funded them.<br><br>This too seems a technique that should be generally applicable.
Surround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from.  If
you want to notice quickly when your beliefs become obsolete, you
can't do better than to be friends with the people whose discoveries
will make them so.<br><br>It's hard enough already not to become the prisoner of your own
expertise, but it will only get harder, because change is accelerating.
That's not a recent trend; change has been accelerating since the
paleolithic era.  Ideas beget ideas.  I don't expect that to change.
But I could be wrong.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
My usual trick is to talk about aspects of the present that
most people haven't noticed yet.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Especially if they become well enough known that people start
to identify them with you.  You have to be extra skeptical about
things you want to believe, and once a hypothesis starts to be
identified with you, it will almost certainly start to be in that
category.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
In practice "sufficiently expert" doesn't require one to be
recognized as an expert—which is a trailing indicator in any
case.  In many fields a year of focused work plus caring a lot would
be enough.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Though they are public and persist indefinitely, comments on
e.g. forums and places like Twitter seem empirically to work like
casual conversation.  The threshold may be whether what you write
has a title.<br><br>

easier because they say they can't find enough programmers in the
US.  Anti-immigration people say that instead of letting foreigners
take these jobs, we should train more Americans to be programmers.
Who's right?<br><br>The technology companies are right. What the anti-immigration people
don't understand is that there is a huge variation in ability between
competent programmers and exceptional ones, and while you can train
people to be competent, you can't train them to be exceptional.
Exceptional programmers have an aptitude for and 
<a href="genius.html"><u>interest in</u></a>
programming that is not merely the product of training.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The US has less than 5% of the world's population.  Which means if
the qualities that make someone a great programmer are evenly
distributed, 95% of great programmers are born outside the US.<br><br>The anti-immigration people have to invent some explanation to
account for all the effort technology companies have expended trying
to make immigration easier.  So they claim it's because they want
to drive down salaries.  But if you talk to startups, you find
practically every one over a certain size has gone through legal
contortions to get programmers into the US, where they then
paid them the same as they'd have paid an American.  Why would they
go to extra trouble to get programmers for the same price?  The
only explanation is that they're telling the truth: there are just
not enough great programmers to go around.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>I asked the CEO of a startup with about 70 programmers how many
more he'd hire if he could get all the great programmers he wanted.
He said "We'd hire 30 tomorrow morning."  And this is one of the
hot startups that always win recruiting battles. It's the same all
over Silicon Valley.  Startups are that constrained for talent.<br><br>It would be great if more Americans were trained as programmers,
but no amount of training can flip a ratio as overwhelming as 95
to 5. Especially since programmers are being trained in other
countries too.  Barring some cataclysm, it will always be true that
most great programmers are born outside the US.  It will always be
true that most people who are great at anything are born outside
the US.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Exceptional performance implies immigration.  A country with only
a few percent of the world's population will be exceptional in some
field only if there are a lot of immigrants working in it.<br><br>But this whole discussion has taken something for granted: that if
we let more great programmers into the US, they'll want to come.
That's true now, and we don't realize how lucky we are that it is.
If we want to keep this option open, the best way to do it is to
take advantage of it: the more of the world's great programmers are
here, the more the rest will want to come here.<br><br>And if we don't, the US could be seriously fucked. I realize that's
strong language, but the people dithering about this don't seem to
realize the power of the forces at work here.  Technology gives the
best programmers huge leverage.  The world market in programmers
seems to be becoming dramatically more liquid.  And since good
people like good colleagues, that means the best programmers could
collect in just a few hubs.  Maybe mostly in one hub.<br><br>What if most of the great programmers collected in one hub, and it
wasn't here?  That scenario may seem unlikely now, but it won't be
if things change as much in the next 50 years as they did in the
last 50.<br><br>We have the potential to ensure that the US remains a technology
superpower just by letting in a few thousand great programmers a
year.  What a colossal mistake it would be to let that opportunity
slip.  It could easily be the defining mistake this generation of
American politicians later become famous for.  And unlike other
potential mistakes on that scale, it costs nothing to fix.<br><br>So please, get on with it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
How much better is a great programmer than an ordinary one?
So much better that you can't even measure the difference directly.
A great programmer doesn't merely do the same work faster.  A great
programmer will invent things an ordinary programmer would never
even think of.  This doesn't mean a great programmer is infinitely
more valuable, because any invention has a finite market value.
But it's easy to imagine cases where a great programmer might invent
things worth 100x or even 1000x an average programmer's salary.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There are a handful of consulting firms that rent out big
pools of foreign programmers they bring in on H1-B visas.  By all
means crack down on these.  It should be easy to write legislation
that distinguishes them, because they are so different from technology
companies.  But it is dishonest of the anti-immigration people to
claim that companies like Google and Facebook are driven by the
same motives.  An influx of inexpensive but mediocre programmers
is the last thing they'd want; it would destroy them.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Though this essay talks about programmers, the group of people
we need to import is broader, ranging from designers to programmers
to electrical engineers.  The best one could do as a general term
might be "digital talent." It seemed better to make the argument a
little too narrow than to confuse everyone with a neologism.<br><br>

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><div><div><div></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></div><div><br><br><div><h1 id="corpdev">Don't Talk to Corp Dev</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">January 2015<br><br>Corporate Development, aka corp dev, is the group within companies
that buys other companies. If you're talking to someone from corp
dev, that's why, whether you realize it yet or not.<br><br>It's usually a mistake to talk to corp dev unless (a) you want to
sell your company right now and (b) you're sufficiently likely to
get an offer at an acceptable price.  In practice that means startups
should only talk to corp dev when they're either doing really well
or really badly.  If you're doing really badly, meaning the company
is about to die, you may as well talk to them, because you have
nothing to lose. And if you're doing really well, you can safely
talk to them, because you both know the price will have to be high,
and if they show the slightest sign of wasting your time, you'll
be confident enough to tell them to get lost.<br><br>The danger is to companies in the middle.  Particularly to young
companies that are growing fast, but haven't been doing it for long
enough to have grown big yet.  It's usually a mistake for a promising
company less than a year old even to talk to corp dev.<br><br>But it's a mistake founders constantly make.  When someone from
corp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should
at least find out what they want.  Besides, they don't want to
offend Big Company by refusing to meet.<br><br>Well, I'll tell you what they want.  They want to talk about buying
you.  That's what the title "corp dev" means.   So before agreeing
to meet with someone from corp dev, ask yourselves, "Do we want to
sell the company right now?"  And if the answer is no, tell them
"Sorry, but we're focusing on growing the company."  They won't be
offended.  And certainly the founders of Big Company won't be
offended. If anything they'll think more highly of you.  You'll
remind them of themselves.  They didn't sell either; that's why
they're in a position now to buy other companies.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Most founders who get contacted by corp dev already know what it
means.  And yet even when they know what corp dev does and know
they don't want to sell, they take the meeting.  Why do they do it?
The same mix of denial and wishful thinking that underlies most
mistakes founders make. It's flattering to talk to someone who wants
to buy you.  And who knows, maybe their offer will be surprisingly
high.  You should at least see what it is, right?<br><br>No.  If they were going to send you an offer immediately by email,
sure, you might as well open it.  But that is not how conversations
with corp dev work.  If you get an offer at all, it will be at the
end of a long and unbelievably distracting process.  And if the
offer is surprising, it will be surprisingly low.<br><br>Distractions are the thing you can least afford in a startup.  And
conversations with corp dev are the worst sort of distraction,
because as well as consuming your <a href="top.html">attention</a> they undermine your
morale.  One of the tricks to surviving a grueling process is not
to stop and think how tired you are.  Instead you get into a sort
of flow. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Imagine what it would do to you if at mile 20 of a
marathon, someone ran up beside you and said "You must feel really
tired.  Would you like to stop and take a rest?"  Conversations
with corp dev are like that but worse, because the suggestion of
stopping gets combined in your mind with the imaginary high price
you think they'll offer.<br><br>And then you're really in trouble.  If they can, corp dev people
like to turn the tables on you. They like to get you to the point
where you're trying to convince them to buy instead of them trying
to convince you to sell.  And surprisingly often they succeed.<br><br>This is a very slippery slope, greased with some of the most powerful
forces that can work on founders' minds, and attended by an experienced
professional whose full time job is to push you down it.<br><br>Their tactics in pushing you down that slope are usually fairly
brutal. Corp dev people's whole job is to buy companies, and they
don't even get to choose which.  The only way their performance is
measured is by how cheaply they can buy you, and the more ambitious
ones will stop at nothing to achieve that. For example, they'll
almost always start with a lowball offer, just to see if you'll
take it. Even if you don't, a low initial offer will demoralize you
and make you easier to manipulate.<br><br>And that is the most innocent of their tactics. Just wait till
you've agreed on a price and think you have a done deal, and then
they come back and say their boss has vetoed the deal and won't do
it for more than half the agreed upon price. Happens all the time.
If you think investors can behave badly, it's nothing compared to
what corp dev people can do.  Even corp dev people at companies
that are otherwise benevolent.<br><br>I remember once complaining to a
friend at Google about some nasty trick their corp dev people had
pulled on a YC startup.<br><br>"What happened to Don't be Evil?" I asked.<br><br>"I don't think corp dev got the memo," he replied.<br><br>The tactics you encounter in M&amp;A conversations can be like nothing
you've experienced in the otherwise comparatively 
<a href="mean.html">upstanding</a> world
of Silicon Valley.  It's as if a chunk of genetic material from the
old-fashioned robber baron business world got incorporated into the
startup world.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The simplest way to protect yourself is to use the trick that John
D. Rockefeller, whose grandfather was an alcoholic, used to protect
himself from becoming one.  He once told a Sunday school class
<blockquote>
  Boys, do you know why I never became a drunkard?  Because I never
  took the first drink.
</blockquote>
Do you want to sell your company right now?  Not eventually, right
now.  If not, just don't take the first meeting.  They won't be
offended.  And you in turn will be guaranteed to be spared one of
the worst experiences that can happen to a startup.<br><br>If you do want to sell, there's another set of 
<a href="https://justinkan.com/the-founders-guide-to-selling-your-company-a1b2025c9481">techniques
</a> for doing
that.  But the biggest mistake founders make in dealing with corp
dev is not doing a bad job of talking to them when they're ready
to, but talking to them before they are.  So if you remember only
the title of this essay, you already know most of what you need to
know about M&amp;A in the first year.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I'm not saying you should never sell.  I'm saying you should
be clear in your own mind about whether you want to sell or not,
and not be led by manipulation or wishful thinking into trying to
sell earlier than you otherwise would have.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In a startup, as in most competitive sports, the task at hand
almost does this for you; you're too busy to feel tired.  But when
you lose that protection, e.g. at the final whistle, the fatigue
hits you like a wave.  To talk to corp dev is to let yourself feel
it mid-game.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
To be fair, the apparent misdeeds of corp dev people are magnified
by the fact that they function as the face of a large organization
that often doesn't know its own mind.  Acquirers can be surprisingly
indecisive about acquisitions, and their flakiness is indistinguishable
from dishonesty by the time it filters down to you.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Marc Andreessen, Jessica Livingston, Geoff

For most of my childhood he worked
for Westinghouse, modelling nuclear reactors.<br><br>He was one of those lucky people who know early on what they want to
do.  When you talk to him about his childhood, there's a clear
watershed at about age 12, when he "got interested in maths."<br><br>He
grew up in the small Welsh seacoast town of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rkzUm">Pwllheli</a>.  As we retraced
his walk to school on Google Street View, he said that it had been
nice growing up in the country.<br><br>"Didn't it get boring when you got to be about 15?" I asked.<br><br>"No," he said, "by then I was interested in maths."<br><br>In another conversation he told me that what he really liked was
solving problems.  To me the exercises at the end of each chapter
in a math textbook represent work, or at best a way to reinforce
what you learned in that chapter.  To him the problems were the
reward.  The text of each chapter was just some advice about solving
them. He said that as soon as he got a new textbook he'd immediately
work out all the problems — to the slight annoyance of his teacher,
since the class was supposed to work through the book gradually.<br><br>Few people know so early or so certainly what they want to work on.
But talking to my father reminded me of a heuristic the rest of us
can use. If something that seems like work to other people doesn't
seem like work to you, that's something you're well suited for.
For example, a lot of programmers I know, including me, actually
like debugging.  It's not something people tend to volunteer; one
likes it the way one likes popping zits. But you may have to like
debugging to like programming, considering the degree to which
programming consists of it.<br><br>The stranger your tastes seem to other people, the stronger evidence
they probably are of what you should do. When I was in college I
used to write papers for my friends.  It was quite interesting to
write a paper for a class I wasn't taking.  Plus they were always
so relieved.<br><br>It seemed curious that the same task could be painful to one person
and pleasant to another, but I didn't realize at the time what this
imbalance implied, because I wasn't looking for it.  I didn't realize
how hard it can be to decide what you should work on, and that you
sometimes have to <a href="love.html">figure it out</a> from subtle clues, like a detective
solving a case in a mystery novel.  So I bet it would help a lot
of people to ask themselves about this explicitly. What seems like
work to other people that doesn't seem like work to you?<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Ron Conway.  He knows what happened in every deal in the Valley,
half the time because he arranged it.<br><br>And yet he's a super nice guy.  In fact, nice is not the word.
Ronco is good. I know of zero instances in which he has behaved
badly.  It's hard even to imagine.<br><br>When I first came to Silicon Valley I thought "How lucky that someone
so powerful is so benevolent."  But gradually I realized it wasn't
luck.  It was by being benevolent that Ronco became so powerful.
All the deals he gets to invest in come to him through referrals.
Google did. Facebook did. Twitter was a referral from Evan Williams
himself.  And the reason so many people refer deals to him is that
he's proven himself to be a good guy.<br><br>Good does not mean being a pushover.  I would not want to face an
angry Ronco.  But if Ron's angry at you, it's because you did
something wrong.  Ron is so old school he's Old Testament.  He will
smite you in his just wrath, but there's no malice in it.<br><br>In almost every domain there are advantages to seeming good.  It
makes people trust you.  But actually being good is an expensive
way to seem good.  To an amoral person it might seem to be overkill.<br><br>In some fields it might be, but apparently not in the startup world.
Though plenty of investors are jerks, there is a clear trend among
them: the most successful investors are also the most upstanding. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>It was not always this way.  I would not feel confident saying that
about investors twenty years ago.<br><br>What changed?  The startup world became more transparent and more
unpredictable.  Both make it harder to seem good without actually
being good.<br><br>It's obvious why transparency has that effect.  When an investor
maltreats a founder now, it gets out.  Maybe not all the way to the
press, but other founders hear about it, and that investor
starts to lose deals. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The effect of unpredictability is more subtle.  It increases the
work of being inconsistent.  If you're going to be two-faced, you
have to know who you should be nice to and who you can get away
with being nasty to.  In the startup world, things change so rapidly
that you can't tell.  The random college kid you talk to today might
in a couple years be the CEO of the hottest startup in the Valley.
If you can't tell who to be nice to, you have to be nice to everyone.
And probably the only people who can manage that are the people who
are genuinely good.<br><br>In a sufficiently connected and unpredictable world, you can't seem
good without being good.<br><br>As often happens, Ron discovered how to be the investor of the
future by accident.  He didn't foresee the future of startup
investing, realize it would pay to be upstanding, and force himself
to behave that way. It would feel unnatural to him to behave any
other way.  He was already 
<a href="startupideas.html">living in the future</a>.<br><br>Fortunately that future is not limited to the startup world.  The
startup world is more transparent and unpredictable than most, but
almost everywhere the trend is in that direction.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I'm not saying that if you sort investors by benevolence
you've also sorted them by returns, but rather that if you do a
scatterplot with benevolence on the x axis and returns on the y,
you'd see a clear upward trend.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Y Combinator in particular, because it aggregates data
from so many startups, has a pretty comprehensive view of
investor behavior.<br><br>

understand startups is to look at the most successful companies and
explain why they were not as lame as they seemed when they first
launched.  Because they practically all seemed lame at first. Not
just small, lame.  Not just the first step up a big mountain.  More
like the first step into a swamp.<br><br>A Basic interpreter for the Altair?  How could that ever grow into
a giant company?  People sleeping on airbeds in strangers' apartments?
A web site for college students to stalk one another?  A wimpy
little single-board computer for hobbyists that used a TV as a
monitor?  A new search engine, when there were already about 10,
and they were all trying to de-emphasize search?  These ideas didn't
just seem small.  They seemed wrong.  They were the kind of ideas
you could not merely ignore, but ridicule.<br><br>Often the founders themselves didn't know why their ideas were
promising.  They were attracted to these ideas by instinct, because
they were <a href="startupideas.html">living in the future</a> and
they sensed that something was missing.  But they could not have
put into words exactly how their ugly ducklings were going to grow
into big, beautiful swans.<br><br>Most people's first impulse when they hear about a lame-sounding
new startup idea is to make fun of it.  Even a lot of people who
should know better.<br><br>When I encounter a startup with a lame-sounding idea, I ask "What
Microsoft is this the Altair Basic of?"  Now it's a puzzle, and the
burden is on me to solve it.  Sometimes I can't think of an answer,
especially when the idea is a made-up one.  But it's remarkable how
often there does turn out to be an answer.  Often it's one the
founders themselves hadn't seen yet.<br><br>Intriguingly, there are sometimes multiple answers.  I talked to a
startup a few days ago that could grow into 3 distinct Microsofts.
They'd probably vary in size by orders of magnitude.  But you can
never predict how big a Microsoft is going to be, so in cases like
that I encourage founders to follow whichever path is most immediately
exciting to them.  Their instincts got them this far. Why stop now?<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

should probably change your name.<br><br>The reason is not just that people can't find you.  For companies
with mobile apps, especially, having the right domain name is not
as critical as it used to be for getting users.  The problem with
not having the .com of your name is that it signals weakness.  Unless
you're so big that your reputation precedes you, a marginal domain
suggests you're a marginal company.  Whereas
(as <xa href="http://stripe.com">Stripe shows)
having x.com signals strength even if it has no relation to what you
do.<br><br>Even good founders can be in denial about this.  Their denial derives
from two very powerful forces: identity, and lack of imagination.<br><br>X is what we <i>are</i>, founders think. There's no other name as good.
Both of which are false.<br><br>You can fix the first by stepping back from the problem. Imagine
you'd called your company something else.  If you had, surely you'd
be just as attached to that name as you are to your current one.
The idea of switching to your current name would seem repellent.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>There's nothing intrinsically great about your current name.  Nearly
all your attachment to it comes from it being attached to you.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The way to neutralize the second source of denial, your inability
to think of other potential names, is to acknowledge that you're
bad at naming.  Naming is a completely separate skill from those
you need to be a good founder.  You can be a great startup founder
but hopeless at thinking of names for your company.<br><br>Once you acknowledge that, you stop believing there is nothing else
you could be called.  There are lots of other potential names that
are as good or better; you just can't think of them.<br><br>How do you find them? One answer is the default way to solve
problems you're bad at: find someone else who can think of names.
But with company names there is another possible
approach.  It turns out almost any word or word pair that is not
an obviously bad name is a sufficiently good one, and the number
of such domains is so large that you can find plenty that are cheap
or even untaken.  So make a list and try to buy some.  That's what
<a href="http://www.quora.com/How-did-Stripe-come-up-with-its-name?share=1">Stripe</a> 
did.  (Their search also turned up parse.com, which their
friends at Parse took.)<br><br>The reason I know that naming companies is a distinct skill orthogonal
to the others you need in a startup is that I happen to have it.
Back when I was running YC and did more office hours with startups,
I would often help them find new names.  80% of the time we could
find at least one good name in a 20 minute office hour slot.<br><br>Now when I do office hours I have to focus on more important
questions, like what the company is doing.  I tell them when they
need to change their name.  But I know the power of the forces that
have them in their grip, so I know most won't listen. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>There are of course examples of startups that have succeeded without
having the .com of their name.  There are startups that have succeeded despite any
number of different mistakes.  But this mistake is less excusable
than most.  It's something that can be fixed in a couple days if
you have sufficient discipline to acknowledge the problem.<br><br>100% of the top 20 YC companies by valuation have the .com of their
name. 94% of the top 50 do. But only 66% of companies in the current
batch have the .com of their name. Which suggests there are lessons
ahead for most of the rest, one way or another.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Incidentally, this thought experiment works for
<a href="identity.html">nationality and religion</a> too.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
The liking you have for a name that has become part of your
identity manifests itself not directly, which would be easy to
discount, but as a collection of specious beliefs about its intrinsic
qualities.  (This too is true of nationality and religion as well.)<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Sometimes founders know it's a problem that they don't have
the .com of their name, but delusion strikes a step later in the belief that they'll
be able to buy it despite having no evidence it's for sale.  Don't
believe a domain is for sale unless the owner has already told you
an asking price.<br><br>

something important: why it's safe for startup founders to be nice
people.<br><br>I grew up with a cartoon idea of a very successful businessman (in
the cartoon it was always a man): a rapacious, cigar-smoking,
table-thumping guy in his fifties who wins by exercising power, and
isn't too fussy about how.  As I've <xa href="mean.html">written before, one of
the things that has surprised me most about startups is 
<a href="mean.html">how few</a> of
the most successful founders are like that.  Maybe successful people
in other industries are; I don't know; but not startup founders.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>I knew this empirically, but I never saw the math of why till I got
this founder's email.  In it he said he worried that he was
fundamentally soft-hearted and tended to give away too much for
free. He thought perhaps he needed "a little dose of sociopath-ness."<br><br>I told him not to worry about it, because so long as he built
something good enough to spread by word of mouth, he'd have a
superlinear growth curve.  If he was bad at extracting money from
people, at worst this curve would be some constant multiple less
than 1 of what it might have been.  But a constant multiple of any
curve is exactly the same shape.  The numbers on the Y axis are
smaller, but the curve is just as steep, and when anything grows
at the rate of a successful startup, the Y axis will take care of
itself.<br><br>Some examples will make this clear.  Suppose your company is making
$1000 a month now, and you've made something so great that it's
growing at 5% a week.  Two years from now, you'll be making about
$160k a month.<br><br>Now suppose you're so un-rapacious that you only extract half as
much from your users as you could.  That means two years later
you'll be making $80k a month instead of $160k.  How far behind are
you? How long will it take to catch up with where you'd have been
if you were extracting every penny?  A mere 15 weeks.  After two
years, the un-rapacious founder is only 3.5 months behind the
rapacious one. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you're going to optimize a number, the one to choose is your
<a href="growth.html">growth rate</a>. Suppose as before that you only extract half as much
from users as you could, but that you're able to grow 6% a week
instead of 5%.  Now how are you doing compared to the rapacious
founder after two years?  You're already ahead—$214k a month
versus $160k—and pulling away fast.  In another year you'll be
making $4.4 million a month to the rapacious founder's $2 million.<br><br>Obviously one case where it would help to be rapacious is when
growth depends on that.  What makes startups different is that
usually it doesn't. Startups usually win by making something so
great that people recommend it to their friends.  And being rapacious
not only doesn't help you do that, but probably hurts.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The reason startup founders can safely be nice is that making great
things is compounded, and rapacity isn't.<br><br>So if you're a founder, here's a deal you can make with yourself
that will both make you happy and make your company successful.
Tell yourself you can be as nice as you want, so long as you work
hard on your growth rate to compensate.  Most successful startups
make that tradeoff unconsciously. Maybe if you do it consciously
you'll do it even better.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Many think successful startup founders are driven by money.
In fact the secret weapon of the most successful founders is that
they aren't.  If they were, they'd have taken one of the acquisition
offers that every fast-growing startup gets on the way up.  What
drives the most successful founders is the same thing that drives
most people who make things: the company is their project.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In fact since 2 ≈ 1.05 ^ 15, the un-rapacious founder is
always 15 weeks behind the rapacious one.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The other reason it might help to be good at squeezing money
out of customers is that startups usually lose money at first, and
making more per customer makes it easier to get to profitability
before your initial funding runs out.  But while it is very common
for startups to <a href="pinch.html">die</a>
from running through their initial funding and then being unable
to raise more, the underlying cause is usually slow growth or
excessive spending rather than insufficient effort to extract money
from existing customers.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Harj Taggar, Jessica Livingston, and

9 months, the first thing I want to know is almost always the same.
Assuming their expenses remain constant and their revenue growth
is what it has been over the last several months, do they make it to
profitability on the money they have left?  Or to put it more
dramatically, by default do they live or die?<br><br>The startling thing is how often the founders themselves don't know.
Half the founders I talk to don't know whether they're default alive
or default dead.<br><br>If you're among that number, Trevor Blackwell has made a handy
<a href="http://growth.tlb.org/#"><u>calculator</u></a> you can use to find out.<br><br>The reason I want to know first whether a startup is default alive
or default dead is that the rest of the conversation depends on the
answer.  If the company is default alive, we can talk about ambitious
new things they could do.  If it's default dead, we probably need
to talk about how to save it.  We know the current trajectory ends
badly.  How can they get off that trajectory?<br><br>Why do so few founders know whether they're default alive or default
dead?  Mainly, I think, because they're not used to asking that.
It's not a question that makes sense to ask early on, any more than
it makes sense to ask a 3 year old how he plans to support
himself.  But as the company grows older, the question switches from
meaningless to critical.  That kind of switch often takes people
by surprise.<br><br>I propose the following solution: instead of starting to ask too
late whether you're default alive or default dead, start asking too
early.  It's hard to say precisely when the question switches
polarity.  But it's probably not that dangerous to start worrying
too early that you're default dead, whereas it's very dangerous to
start worrying too late.<br><br>The reason is a phenomenon I wrote about earlier: the
<a href="pinch.html">fatal pinch</a>.
The fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enough
time to fix it.  And the way founders end up in it is by not realizing
that's where they're headed.<br><br>There is another reason founders don't ask themselves whether they're
default alive or default dead: they assume it will be easy to raise
more money.  But that assumption is often false, and worse still, the
more you depend on it, the falser it becomes.<br><br>Maybe it will help to separate facts from hopes. Instead of thinking
of the future with vague optimism, explicitly separate the components.
Say "We're default dead, but we're counting on investors to save
us." Maybe as you say that, it will set off the same alarms in your
head that it does in mine.  And if you set off the alarms sufficiently
early, you may be able to avoid the fatal pinch.<br><br>It would be safe to be default dead if you could count on investors
saving you.  As a rule their interest is a function of
growth.  If you have steep revenue growth, say over 5x a year, you
can start to count on investors being interested even if you're not
profitable.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
But investors are so fickle that you can never
do more than start to count on them.  Sometimes something about your
business will spook investors even if your growth is great.  So no
matter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising
as more than a plan A. You should always have a plan B as well: you
should know (as in write down) precisely what you'll need to do to
survive if you can't raise more money, and precisely when you'll 
have to switch to plan B if plan A isn't working.<br><br>In any case, growing fast versus operating cheaply is far from the
sharp dichotomy many founders assume it to be.  In practice there
is surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spends
and how fast it grows.  When a startup grows fast, it's usually
because the product hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some big
need straight on.  When a startup spends a lot, it's usually because
the product is expensive to develop or sell, or simply because
they're wasteful.<br><br>If you're paying attention, you'll be asking at this point not just
how to avoid the fatal pinch, but how to avoid being default dead.
That one is easy: don't hire too fast.  Hiring too fast is by far
the biggest killer of startups that raise money.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Founders tell themselves they need to hire in order to grow.  But
most err on the side of overestimating this need rather than
underestimating it.  Why?  Partly because there's so much work to
do.  Naive founders think that if they can just hire enough
people, it will all get done.  Partly because successful startups have
lots of employees, so it seems like that's what one does in order
to be successful.  In fact the large staffs of successful startups
are probably more the effect of growth than the cause.  And
partly because when founders have slow growth they don't want to
face what is usually the real reason: the product is not appealing
enough.<br><br>Plus founders who've just raised money are often encouraged to
overhire by the VCs who funded them.  Kill-or-cure strategies are
optimal for VCs because they're protected by the portfolio effect.
VCs want to blow you up, in one sense of the phrase or the other.
But as a founder your incentives are different.  You want above all
to survive.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Here's a common way startups die.  They make something moderately
appealing and have decent initial growth. They raise their first
round fairly easily, because the founders seem smart and the idea
sounds plausible. But because the product is only moderately
appealing, growth is ok but not great.  The founders convince
themselves that hiring a bunch of people is the way to boost growth.
Their investors agree.  But (because the product is only moderately
appealing) the growth never comes.  Now they're rapidly running out
of runway.  They hope further investment will save them. But because
they have high expenses and slow growth, they're now unappealing
to investors. They're unable to raise more, and the company dies.<br><br>What the company should have done is address the fundamental problem:
that the product is only moderately appealing.  Hiring people is
rarely the way to fix that.  More often than not it makes it harder.
At this early stage, the product needs to evolve more than to be
"built out," and that's usually easier with fewer people.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Asking whether you're default alive or default dead may save you
from this.  Maybe the alarm bells it sets off will counteract the
forces that push you to overhire.  Instead you'll be compelled to
seek growth in other ways. For example, by <a href="ds.html"><u>doing
things that don't scale</u></a>, or by redesigning the product in the
way only founders can.
And for many if not most startups, these paths to growth will be
the ones that actually work.<br><br>Airbnb waited 4 months after raising money at the end of Y&nbsp;Combinator
before they hired their first employee.  In the meantime the founders
were terribly overworked.  But they were overworked evolving Airbnb
into the astonishingly successful organism it is now.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Steep usage growth will also interest investors.  Revenue
will ultimately be a constant multiple of usage, so x% usage growth
predicts x% revenue growth.  But in practice investors discount
merely predicted revenue, so if you're measuring usage you need a
higher growth rate to impress investors.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Startups that don't raise money are saved from hiring too
fast because they can't afford to. But that doesn't mean you should
avoid raising money in order to avoid this problem, any more than
that total abstinence is the only way to avoid becoming an alcoholic.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
I would not be surprised if VCs' tendency to push founders
to overhire is not even in their own interest.  They don't know how
many of the companies that get killed by overspending might have
done well if they'd survived.  My guess is a significant number.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
After reading a draft, Sam Altman wrote:<br><br>"I think you should make the hiring point more strongly.  I think
it's roughly correct to say that YC's most successful companies
have never been the fastest to hire, and one of the marks of a great
founder is being able to resist this urge."<br><br>Paul Buchheit adds:<br><br>"A related problem that I see a lot is premature scaling—founders
take a small business that isn't really working (bad unit economics,
typically) and then scale it up because they want impressive growth
numbers. This is similar to over-hiring in that it makes the business
much harder to fix once it's big, plus they are bleeding cash really
fast."<br><br>

write: write in spoken language.<br><br>Something comes over most people when they start writing. They write
in a different language than they'd use if they were talking to a
friend. The sentence structure and even the words are different.
No one uses "pen" as a verb in spoken English. You'd feel like an
idiot using "pen" instead of "write" in a conversation with a friend.<br><br>The last straw for me was a sentence I read a couple days ago:
<blockquote>
  The mercurial Spaniard himself declared: "After Altamira, all is
  decadence."
</blockquote>
It's from Neil Oliver's <i>A History of Ancient Britain</i>. I feel bad
making an example of this book, because it's no worse than lots of
others.  But just imagine calling Picasso "the mercurial Spaniard" when
talking to a friend.  Even one
sentence of this would raise eyebrows in conversation.  And yet
people write whole books of it.<br><br>Ok, so written and spoken language are different. Does that make
written language worse?<br><br>If you want people to read and understand what you write, yes.
Written language is more complex, which makes it more work to read.
It's also more formal and distant, which gives the reader's attention
permission to drift.  But perhaps worst of all, the complex sentences
and fancy words give you, the writer, the false impression that
you're saying more than you actually are.<br><br>You don't need complex sentences to express complex ideas.  When
specialists in some abstruse topic talk to one another about ideas
in their field, they don't use sentences any more complex than they
do when talking about what to have for lunch.  They use different
words, certainly.  But even those they use no more than necessary.
And in my experience, the harder the subject, the more informally
experts speak. Partly, I think, because they have less to prove,
and partly because the harder the ideas you're talking about, the
less you can afford to let language get in the way.<br><br>Informal language is the athletic clothing of ideas.<br><br>I'm not saying spoken language always works best. Poetry is as much
music as text, so you can say things you wouldn't say in conversation.
And there are a handful of writers who can get away with using fancy
language in prose. And then of course there are cases where writers
don't want to make it easy to understand what they're saying—in
corporate announcements of bad news, for example, or at the more
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=1,5&amp;q=transgression+narrative+postmodern+gender"><u>bogus</u></a> end of the humanities.  But for nearly everyone else, spoken
language is better.<br><br>It seems to be hard for most people to write in spoken language.
So perhaps the best solution is to write your first draft the way
you usually would, then afterward look at each sentence and ask "Is
this the way I'd say this if I were talking to a friend?" If it
isn't, imagine what you would say, and use that instead.  After a
while this filter will start to operate as you write. When you write
something you wouldn't say, you'll hear the clank as it hits the
page.<br><br>Before I publish a new essay, I read it out loud and fix everything
that doesn't sound like conversation. I even fix bits that are
phonetically awkward; I don't know if that's necessary, but it
doesn't cost much.<br><br>This trick may not always be enough.  I've seen writing so far
removed from spoken language that it couldn't be fixed sentence by
sentence.  For cases like that there's a more drastic solution.
After writing the first draft, try explaining to a friend what you
just wrote. Then replace the draft with what you said to your friend.<br><br>People often tell me how much my essays sound like me talking.
The fact that this seems worthy of comment shows how rarely people
manage to write in spoken language.  Otherwise everyone's writing
would sound like them talking.<br><br>If you simply manage to write in spoken language, you'll be ahead
of 95% of writers.  And it's so easy to do: just don't let a sentence
through unless it's the way you'd say it to a friend.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Patrick Collison and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://note.com/tokyojack/n/n9a13ac4cd47d">Japanese Translation</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/77f20bddf0796dab3beb04d1913b5620.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://tldrarabiccontents.blogspot.com/2020/01/blog-post_30.html">Arabic Translation</a><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="/Users/stopa/projects/pg-essays/book/gen/assets/6c9d841e4b1acd9878bfec968e99c5c3.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

it's possible to detect bias in a selection process without knowing
anything about the applicant pool.  Which is exciting because among
other things it means third parties can use this technique to detect
bias whether those doing the selecting want them to or not.<br><br>You can use this technique whenever (a) you have at least
a random sample of the applicants that were selected, (b) their
subsequent performance is measured, and (c) the groups of
applicants you're comparing have roughly equal distribution of ability.<br><br>How does it work?  Think about what it means to be biased.  What
it means for a selection process to be biased against applicants
of type x is that it's harder for them to make it through.  Which
means applicants of type x have to be better to get selected than
applicants not of type x.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font>
Which means applicants of type x
who do make it through the selection process will outperform other
successful applicants.  And if the performance of all the successful
applicants is measured, you'll know if they do.<br><br>Of course, the test you use to measure performance must be a valid
one.  And in particular it must not be invalidated by the bias you're
trying to measure.
But there are some domains where performance can be measured, and
in those detecting bias is straightforward. Want to know if the
selection process was biased against some type of applicant?  Check
whether they outperform the others.  This is not just a heuristic
for detecting bias.  It's what bias means.<br><br>For example, many suspect that venture capital firms are biased
against female founders. This would be easy to detect: among their
portfolio companies, do startups with female founders outperform
those without?  A couple months ago, one VC firm (almost certainly
unintentionally) published a study showing bias of this type. First
Round Capital found that among its portfolio companies, startups
with female founders <a href="http://10years.firstround.com/#one"><u>outperformed</u></a>
those without by 63%. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The reason I began by saying that this technique would come as a
surprise to many people is that we so rarely see analyses of this
type.  I'm sure it will come as a surprise to First Round that they
performed one. I doubt anyone there realized that by limiting their
sample to their own portfolio, they were producing a study not of
startup trends but of their own biases when selecting companies.<br><br>I predict we'll see this technique used more in the future.  The
information needed to conduct such studies is increasingly available.
Data about who applies for things is usually closely guarded by the
organizations selecting them, but nowadays data about who gets
selected is often publicly available to anyone who takes the trouble
to aggregate it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This technique wouldn't work if the selection process looked
for different things from different types of applicants—for
example, if an employer hired men based on their ability but women
based on their appearance.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
As Paul Buchheit points out, First Round excluded their most 
successful investment, Uber, from the study.  And while it 
makes sense to exclude outliers from some types of studies, 
studies of returns from startup investing, which is all about 
hitting outliers, are not one of them.<br><br>

it had been a "one-man show."  It's sadly common to read that sort
of thing.  But the problem with that description is not just that
it's unfair.  It's also misleading.  Much of what's most novel about
YC is due to Jessica Livingston.  If you don't understand her, you
don't understand YC.  So let me tell you a little about Jessica.<br><br>YC had 4 founders.  Jessica and I decided one night to start it,
and the next day we recruited my friends Robert Morris and Trevor
Blackwell.  Jessica and I ran YC day to day, and Robert and Trevor
read applications and did interviews with us.<br><br>Jessica and I were already dating when we started YC.  At first we
tried to act "professional" about this, meaning we tried to conceal
it.  In retrospect that seems ridiculous, and we soon dropped the
pretense.  And the fact that Jessica and I were a couple is a big
part of what made YC what it was.  YC felt like a family.  The
founders early on were mostly young.  We all had dinner together
once a week, cooked for the first couple years by me. Our first
building had been a private home.  The overall atmosphere was
shockingly different from a VC's office on Sand Hill Road, in a way
that was entirely for the better.  There was an authenticity that
everyone who walked in could sense.  And that didn't just mean that
people trusted us.  It was the perfect quality to instill in startups.
Authenticity is one of the most important things YC looks for in
founders, not just because fakers and opportunists are annoying,
but because authenticity is one of the main things that separates
the most successful startups from the rest.<br><br>Early YC was a family, and Jessica was its mom.  And the culture
she defined was one of YC's most important innovations.  Culture
is important in any organization, but at YC culture wasn't just how
we behaved when we built the product. At YC, the culture was the
product.<br><br>Jessica was also the mom in another sense: she had the last word.
Everything we did as an organization went through her <nobr>first — who</nobr>
to fund, what to say to the public, how to deal with other companies,
who to hire, everything.<br><br>Before we had kids, YC was more or less our life. There was no real
distinction between working hours and not.  We talked about YC all
the time.  And while there might be some businesses that it would
be tedious to let infect your private life, we liked it. We'd started
YC because it was something we were interested in.  And some of the
problems we were trying to solve were endlessly difficult.  How do
you recognize good founders?  You could talk about that for years,
and we did; we still do.<br><br>I'm better at some things than Jessica, and she's better at some
things than me.  One of the things she's best at is judging people.
She's one of those rare individuals with x-ray vision for character.
She can see through any kind of faker almost immediately.  Her
nickname within YC was the Social Radar, and this special power of
hers was critical in making YC what it is.  The earlier you pick
startups, the more you're picking the founders.  Later stage investors
get to try products and look at growth numbers.  At the stage where
YC invests, there is often neither a product nor any numbers.<br><br>Others thought YC had some special insight about the future of
technology.  Mostly we had the same sort of insight Socrates claimed:
we at least knew we knew nothing.  What made YC successful was being
able to pick good founders.  We thought Airbnb was a bad idea.  We
funded it because we liked the founders.<br><br>During interviews, Robert and Trevor and I would pepper the applicants
with technical questions.  Jessica would mostly watch.  A lot of
the applicants probably read her as some kind of secretary, especially
early on, because she was the one who'd go out and get each new
group and she didn't ask many questions. She was ok with that.  It
was easier for her to watch people if they didn't notice her. But
after the interview, the three of us would turn to Jessica and ask
"What does the Social Radar say?"
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Having the Social Radar at interviews wasn't just how we picked
founders who'd be successful.  It was also how we picked founders
who were good people.  At first we did this because we couldn't
help it.  Imagine what it would feel like to have x-ray vision for
character.  Being around bad people would be intolerable.  So we'd
refuse to fund founders whose characters we had doubts about even
if we thought they'd be successful.<br><br>Though we initially did this out of self-indulgence, it turned out
to be very valuable to YC.  We didn't realize it in the beginning,
but the people we were picking would become the YC alumni network.
And once we picked them, unless they did something really egregious,
they were going to be part of it for life. Some now think YC's
alumni network is its most valuable feature. I personally think
YC's advice is pretty good too, but the alumni network is certainly
among the most valuable features.  The level of trust and helpfulness
is remarkable for a group of such size.  And Jessica is the main
reason why.<br><br>(As we later learned, it probably cost us little to reject people
whose characters we had doubts about, because how good founders are
and how well they do are <a href="mean.html"><u>not orthogonal</u></a>.  If bad founders succeed
at all, they tend to sell early.  The most successful founders are
almost all good.)<br><br>If Jessica was so important to YC, why don't more people realize
it?  Partly because I'm a writer, and writers always get disproportionate
attention.  YC's brand was initially my brand, and our applicants
were people who'd read my essays.  But there is another reason:
Jessica hates attention.  Talking to reporters makes her nervous.
The thought of giving a talk paralyzes her.  She was even uncomfortable
at our wedding, because the bride is always the center of attention.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>It's not just because she's shy that she hates attention, but because
it throws off the Social Radar. She can't be herself. You can't
watch people when everyone is watching you.<br><br>Another reason attention worries her is that she hates bragging.
In anything she does that's publicly visible, her biggest fear
(after the obvious fear that it will be bad) is that it will seem
ostentatious.  She says being too modest is a common problem for
women.  But in her case it goes beyond that.  She has a horror of
ostentation so visceral it's almost a phobia.<br><br>She also hates fighting. She can't do it; she just shuts down.  And
unfortunately there is a good deal of fighting in being the public
face of an organization.<br><br>So although Jessica more than anyone made YC unique, the very
qualities that enabled her to do it mean she tends to get written
out of YC's history.  Everyone buys this story that PG started YC
and his wife just kind of helped.  Even YC's haters buy it.  A
couple years ago when people were attacking us for not funding more
female founders (than exist), they all treated YC as identical with
PG.  It would have spoiled the narrative to acknowledge Jessica's
central role at YC.<br><br>Jessica was boiling mad that people were accusing <i>her</i> company of
sexism. I've never seen her angrier about anything.  But she did
not contradict them.  Not publicly.  In private there was a great
deal of profanity.  And she wrote three separate essays about the
question of female founders.  But she could never bring herself to
publish any of them.  She'd seen the level of vitriol in this debate,
and she shrank from engaging.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>It wasn't just because she disliked fighting.  She's so sensitive
to character that it repels her even to fight with dishonest people.
The idea of mixing it up with linkbait journalists or Twitter trolls
would seem to her not merely frightening, but disgusting.<br><br>But Jessica knew her example as a successful female founder would
encourage more women to start companies, so last year she did
something YC had never done before and hired a PR firm to get her
some interviews.  At one of the first she did, the reporter brushed
aside her insights about startups and turned it into a sensationalistic
story about how some guy had tried to chat her up as she was waiting
outside the bar where they had arranged to meet.  Jessica was
mortified, partly because the guy had done nothing wrong, but more
because the story treated her as a victim significant only for being
a woman, rather than one of the most knowledgeable investors in the
Valley.<br><br>After that she told the PR firm to stop.<br><br>You're not going to be hearing in the press about what Jessica has
achieved. So let me tell you what Jessica has achieved.  <nobr>Y Combinator</nobr>
is fundamentally a nexus of people, like a university. It doesn't
make a product. What defines it is the people.  Jessica more than
anyone curated and nurtured that collection of people.  In that
sense she literally made YC.<br><br>Jessica knows more about the qualities of startup founders than
anyone else ever has. Her immense data set and x-ray vision are the
perfect storm in that respect.  The qualities of the founders are
the best predictor of how a startup will do.  And startups are in
turn the most important source of growth in mature economies.<br><br>The person who knows the most about the most important factor in
the growth of mature economies — that is who Jessica Livingston is.
Doesn't that sound like someone who should be better known?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Harj Taggar reminded me that while Jessica didn't ask many
questions, they tended to be important ones:<br><br>"She was always good at sniffing out any red flags about the team
or their determination and disarmingly asking the right question,
which usually revealed more than the founders realized."<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Or more precisely, while she likes getting attention in the
sense of getting credit for what she has done, she doesn't like
getting attention in the sense of being watched in real time.
Unfortunately, not just for her but for a lot of people, how much
you get of the former depends a lot on how much you get of the
latter.<br><br>Incidentally, if you saw Jessica at a public event, you would never
guess she
hates attention, because (a) she is very polite and (b) when she's
nervous, she expresses it by smiling more.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The existence of people like Jessica is not just something
the mainstream media needs to learn to acknowledge, but something
feminists need to learn to acknowledge as well.  There are successful
women who don't like to fight.  Which means if the public conversation
about women consists of fighting, their voices will be silenced.<br><br>There's a sort of Gresham's Law of conversations. If a conversation
reaches a certain level of incivility, the more thoughtful people
start to leave. No one understands female founders better than
Jessica.  But it's unlikely anyone will ever hear her speak candidly
about the topic. She ventured a toe in that water a while ago, and
the reaction was so violent that she decided "never again."<br><br>

your lifetime.  A lot of the change I've seen is fragmentation.  US
politics is much more polarized than it used to be.  Culturally we
have ever less common ground. The creative class flocks to a handful
of happy cities, abandoning the rest.  And increasing economic
inequality means the spread between rich and poor is growing too.
I'd like to propose a hypothesis: that all these trends are instances
of the same phenomenon.  And moreover, that the cause is not some
force that's pulling us apart, but rather the erosion of forces
that had been pushing us together.<br><br>Worse still, for those who worry about these trends, the forces
that were pushing us together were an anomaly, a one-time combination
of circumstances that's unlikely to be repeated — and indeed, that
we would not want to repeat.<br><br>The two forces were war (above all World War II), and the rise of
large corporations.<br><br>The effects of World War II were both economic and social.
Economically, it decreased variation in income.  Like all modern
armed forces, America's were socialist economically.  From each
according to his ability, to each according to his need.  More or
less.  Higher ranking members of the military got more (as higher
ranking members of socialist societies always do), but what they
got was fixed according to their rank.  And the flattening effect
wasn't limited to those under arms, because the US economy was
conscripted too.  Between 1942 and 1945 all wages were set by the
National War Labor Board. Like the military, they defaulted to
flatness.  And this national standardization of wages was so pervasive
that its effects could still be seen years after the war ended.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Business owners weren't supposed to be making money either.  FDR
said "not a single war millionaire" would be permitted.  To ensure
that, any increase in a company's profits over prewar levels was
taxed at 85%.  And when what was left after corporate taxes reached
individuals, it was taxed again at a marginal rate of 93%.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Socially too the war tended to decrease variation.  Over 16 million
men and women from all sorts of different backgrounds were brought
together in a way of life that was literally uniform.  Service rates
for men born in the early 1920s approached 80%. And working toward
a common goal, often under stress, brought them still closer together.<br><br>Though strictly speaking World War II lasted less than 4 years for
the US, its effects lasted longer.  Wars make central governments
more powerful, and World War II was an extreme case of this.  In
the US, as in all the other Allied countries, the federal government
was slow to give up the new powers it had acquired.  Indeed, in
some respects the war didn't end in 1945; the enemy just switched
to the Soviet Union.  In tax rates, federal power, defense spending,
conscription, and nationalism, the decades after the war looked more
like wartime than prewar peacetime.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
And the social effects
lasted too.  The kid pulled into the army from behind a mule team
in West Virginia didn't simply go back to the farm afterward.
Something else was waiting for him, something that looked a lot
like the army.<br><br>If total war was the big political story of the 20th century, the
big economic story was the rise of a new kind of company.  And this
too tended to produce both social and economic cohesion.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>The 20th century was the century of the big, national corporation.
General Electric, General Foods, General Motors.  Developments in
finance, communications, transportation, and manufacturing enabled
a new type of company whose goal was above all scale.  Version 1
of this world was low-res: a Duplo world of a few giant companies
dominating each big market.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>The late 19th and early 20th centuries had been a time of consolidation,
led especially by J. P. Morgan.  Thousands of companies run by their
founders were merged into a couple hundred giant ones run by
professional managers. Economies of scale ruled the day.  It seemed
to people at the time that this was the final state of things.  John
D. Rockefeller said in 1880
<blockquote>
  The day of combination is here to stay. Individualism has gone,
  never to return.
</blockquote>
He turned out to be mistaken, but he seemed right for the next
hundred years.<br><br>The consolidation that began in the late 19th century continued for
most of the 20th.  By the end of World War II, as Michael Lind
writes, "the major sectors of the economy were either organized
as government-backed cartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic
corporations."<br><br>For consumers this new world meant the same choices everywhere, but
only a few of them.  When I grew up there were only 2 or 3 of most
things, and since they were all aiming at the middle of the market
there wasn't much to differentiate them.<br><br>One of the most important instances of this phenomenon was in TV.
Here there were 3 choices: NBC, CBS, and ABC. Plus public TV for
eggheads and communists.  The programs that the 3 networks offered were
indistinguishable.  In fact, here there was a triple pressure toward
the center. If one show did try something daring, local affiliates
in conservative markets would make them stop. Plus since TVs were
expensive, whole families watched the same shows together, so they
had to be suitable for everyone.<br><br>And not only did everyone get the same thing, they got it at the
same time.  It's difficult to imagine now, but every night tens of
millions of families would sit down together in front of their TV
set watching the same show, at the same time, as their next door
neighbors.  What happens now with the Super Bowl used to happen
every night. We were literally in sync.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>In a way mid-century TV culture was good. The view it gave of the
world was like you'd find in a children's book, and it probably had
something of the effect that (parents hope) children's books have
in making people behave better.  But, like children's books, TV was
also misleading.  Dangerously misleading, for adults. In his
autobiography, Robert MacNeil talks of seeing gruesome images that
had just come in from Vietnam and thinking, we can't show these to
families while they're having dinner.<br><br>I know how pervasive the common culture was, because I tried to opt
out of it, and it was practically impossible to find alternatives.
When I was 13 I realized, more from internal evidence than any
outside source, that the ideas we were being fed on TV were crap,
and I stopped watching it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
But it wasn't just TV.  It seemed
like everything around me was crap.  The politicians all saying the
same things, the consumer brands making almost identical products
with different labels stuck on to indicate how prestigious they
were meant to be, the balloon-frame houses with fake "colonial"
skins, the cars with several feet of gratuitous metal on each end
that started to fall apart after a couple years, the "red delicious"
apples that were red but only <xa href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/the-evil-reign-of-the-red-delicious/379892/">nominally 
apples. And in retrospect, it <i>was</i> crap.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>But when I went looking for alternatives to fill this void, I found
practically nothing.  There was no Internet then.  The only place
to look was in the chain bookstore in our local shopping mall. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font>
There I found a copy of <i>The Atlantic</i>.  I wish I could say it became
a gateway into a wider world, but in fact I found it boring and
incomprehensible.  Like a kid tasting whisky for the first time and
pretending to like it, I preserved that magazine as carefully as
if it had been a book. I'm sure I still have it somewhere.  But
though it was evidence that there was, somewhere, a world that
wasn't red delicious, I didn't find it till college.<br><br>It wasn't just as consumers that the big companies made us similar.
They did as employers too.  Within companies there were powerful
forces pushing people toward a single model of how to look and act.
IBM was particularly notorious for this, but they were only a little
more extreme than other big companies.  And the models of how to
look and act varied little between companies. Meaning everyone
within this world was expected to seem more or less the same.  And
not just those in the corporate world, but also everyone who aspired
to it — which in the middle of the 20th century meant most people
who weren't already in it.  For most of the 20th century, working-class
people tried hard to look middle class.  You can see it in old
photos.  Few adults aspired to look dangerous in 1950.<br><br>But the rise of national corporations didn't just compress us
culturally.  It compressed us economically too, and on both ends.<br><br>Along with giant national corporations, we got giant national labor
unions.  And in the mid 20th century the corporations cut deals
with the unions where they paid over market price for labor.  Partly
because the unions were monopolies. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font>
Partly because, as
components of oligopolies themselves, the corporations knew they
could safely pass the cost on to their customers, because their
competitors would have to as well.  And partly because in mid-century
most of the giant companies were still focused on finding new ways
to milk economies of scale.  Just as startups rightly pay AWS a
premium over the cost of running their own servers so they can focus
on growth, many of the big national corporations were willing to
pay a premium for labor. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>As well as pushing incomes up from the bottom, by overpaying unions,
the big companies of the 20th century also pushed incomes down at
the top, by underpaying their top management. Economist J. K.
Galbraith wrote in 1967 that "There are few corporations in which
it would be suggested that executive salaries are at a maximum."
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>To some extent this was an illusion.  Much of the de facto pay of
executives never showed up on their income tax returns, because it
took the form of perks.  The higher the rate of income tax, the
more pressure there was to pay employees upstream of it.  (In the
UK, where taxes were even higher than in the US, companies would
even pay their kids' private school tuitions.)  One of the most
valuable things the big companies of the mid 20th century gave their
employees was job security, and this too didn't show up in tax
returns or income statistics. So the nature of employment in these
organizations tended to yield falsely low numbers about economic
inequality.  But even accounting for that, the big companies paid
their best people less than market price.  There was no market; the
expectation was that you'd work for the same company for decades
if not your whole career. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>Your work was so illiquid there was little chance of getting market
price. But that same illiquidity also encouraged you not to seek
it.  If the company promised to employ you till you retired and
give you a pension afterward, you didn't want to extract as much
from it this year as you could. You needed to take care of the
company so it could take care of you.  Especially when you'd been
working with the same group of people for decades.  If you tried
to squeeze the company for more money, you were squeezing the
organization that was going to take care of <i>them</i>.  Plus if
you didn't put the company first you wouldn't be promoted, and if
you couldn't switch ladders, promotion on this one was the only way
up. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#999999">14</font></a>]</font><br><br>To someone who'd spent several formative years in the armed forces,
this situation didn't seem as strange as it does to us now.  From
their point of view, as big company executives, they were high-ranking
officers.  They got paid a lot more than privates.  They got to
have expense account lunches at the best restaurants and fly around
on the company's Gulfstreams.  It probably didn't occur to most of
them to ask if they were being paid market price.<br><br>The ultimate way to get market price is to work for yourself, by
starting your own company.  That seems obvious to any ambitious
person now.  But in the mid 20th century it was an alien concept.
Not because starting one's own company seemed too ambitious, but
because it didn't seem ambitious enough. Even as late as the 1970s,
when I grew up, the ambitious plan was to get lots of education at
prestigious institutions, and then join some other prestigious
institution and work one's way up the hierarchy.  Your prestige was
the prestige of the institution you belonged to.  People did start
their own businesses of course, but educated people rarely did,
because in those days there was practically zero concept of starting
what we now call a <a href="growth.html"><u>startup</u></a>: 
a business that starts small and grows
big.  That was much harder to do in the mid 20th century.  Starting
one's own business meant starting a business that would start small
and stay small. Which in those days of big companies often meant
scurrying around trying to avoid being trampled by elephants.  It
was more prestigious to be one of the executive class riding the
elephant.<br><br>By the 1970s, no one stopped to wonder where the big prestigious
companies had come from in the first place.  It seemed like they'd
always been there, like the chemical elements.  And indeed, there
was a double wall between ambitious kids in the 20th century and
the origins of the big companies.  Many of the big companies were
roll-ups that didn't have clear founders.  And when they did, the
founders didn't seem like us.  Nearly all of them had been uneducated,
in the sense of not having been to college.  They were what Shakespeare
called rude mechanicals.  College trained one to be a member of the
professional classes.  Its graduates didn't expect to do the sort
of grubby menial work that Andrew Carnegie or Henry Ford started
out doing. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#999999">15</font></a>]</font><br><br>And in the 20th century there were more and more college graduates.
They increased from about 2% of the population in 1900 to about 25%
in 2000. In the middle of the century our two big forces intersect,
in the form of the GI Bill, which sent 2.2 million World War II
veterans to college.  Few thought of it in these terms, but the
result of making college the canonical path for the ambitious was
a world in which it was socially acceptable to work for Henry Ford,
but not to be Henry Ford.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#999999">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>I remember this world well. I came of age just as it was starting
to break up. In my childhood it was still dominant. Not quite so
dominant as it had been.  We could see from old TV shows and yearbooks
and the way adults acted that people in the 1950s and 60s had been
even more conformist than us.  The mid-century model was already
starting to get old. But that was not how we saw it at the time.
We would at most have said that one could be a bit more daring in
1975 than 1965.  And indeed, things hadn't changed much yet.<br><br>But change was coming soon. And when the Duplo economy started to
disintegrate, it disintegrated in several different ways at once.
Vertically integrated companies literally dis-integrated because
it was more efficient to.  Incumbents faced new competitors as (a)
markets went global and (b) technical innovation started to trump
economies of scale, turning size from an asset into a liability.
Smaller companies were increasingly able to survive as formerly
narrow channels to consumers broadened.  Markets themselves started
to change faster, as whole new categories of products appeared. And
last but not least, the federal government, which had previously
smiled upon J. P. Morgan's world as the natural state of things,
began to realize it wasn't the last word after all.<br><br>What J. P. Morgan was to the horizontal axis, Henry Ford was to the
vertical.  He wanted to do everything himself. The giant plant he
built at River Rouge between 1917 and 1928 literally took in iron
ore at one end and sent cars out the other.  100,000 people worked
there. At the time it seemed the future. But that is not how car
companies operate today.  Now much of the design and manufacturing
happens in a long supply chain, whose products the car companies
ultimately assemble and sell.  The reason car companies operate
this way is that it works better.  Each company in the supply chain
focuses on what they know best. And they each have to do it well
or they can be swapped out for another supplier.<br><br>Why didn't Henry Ford realize that networks of cooperating companies
work better than a single big company? One reason is that supplier
networks take a while to evolve. In 1917, doing everything himself
seemed to Ford the only way to get the scale he needed. And the
second reason is that if you want to solve a problem using a network
of cooperating companies, you have to be able to coordinate their
efforts, and you can do that much better with computers.  Computers
reduce the transaction costs that Coase argued are the raison d'etre
of corporations. That is a fundamental change.<br><br>In the early 20th century, big companies were synonymous with
efficiency.  In the late 20th century they were synonymous with
inefficiency.  To some extent this was because the companies
themselves had become sclerotic.  But it was also because our
standards were higher.<br><br>It wasn't just within existing industries that change occurred.
The industries themselves changed.  It became possible to make lots
of new things, and sometimes the existing companies weren't the
ones who did it best.<br><br>Microcomputers are a classic example. The market was pioneered by
upstarts like Apple. When it got big enough, IBM decided it was
worth paying attention to.  At the time IBM completely dominated
the computer industry. They assumed that all they had to do, now
that this market was ripe, was to reach out and pick it.  Most
people at the time would have agreed with them.  But what happened
next illustrated how much more complicated the world had become.
IBM did launch a microcomputer.  Though quite successful, it did
not crush Apple.  But even more importantly, IBM itself ended up
being supplanted by a supplier coming in from the side — from
software, which didn't even seem to be the same business.  IBM's
big mistake was to accept a non-exclusive license for DOS.  It must
have seemed a safe move at the time.  No other computer manufacturer
had ever been able to outsell them. What difference did it make if
other manufacturers could offer DOS too?  The result of that
miscalculation was an explosion of inexpensive PC clones.  Microsoft
now owned the PC standard, and the customer.  And the microcomputer
business ended up being Apple vs Microsoft.<br><br>Basically, Apple bumped IBM and then Microsoft stole its wallet.
That sort of thing did not happen to big companies in mid-century.
But it was going to happen increasingly often in the future.<br><br>Change happened mostly by itself in the computer business.  In other
industries, legal obstacles had to be removed first.  Many of the
mid-century oligopolies had been anointed by the federal government
with policies (and in wartime, large orders) that kept out competitors.
This didn't seem as dubious to government officials at the time as
it sounds to us. They felt a two-party system ensured sufficient
competition in politics.  It ought to work for business too.<br><br>Gradually the government realized that anti-competitive policies
were doing more harm than good, and during the Carter administration
it started to remove them. The word used for this process was
misleadingly narrow: deregulation.  What was really happening was
de-oligopolization.  It happened to one industry after another.
Two of the most visible to consumers were air travel and long-distance
phone service, which both became dramatically cheaper after
deregulation.<br><br>Deregulation also contributed to the wave of hostile takeovers in
the 1980s.  In the old days the only limit on the inefficiency of
companies, short of actual bankruptcy, was the inefficiency of their
competitors.  Now companies had to face absolute rather than relative
standards.  Any public company that didn't generate sufficient
returns on its assets risked having its management replaced with
one that would.  Often the new managers did this by breaking companies
up into components that were more valuable separately.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f17n"><font color="#999999">17</font></a>]</font><br><br>Version 1 of the national economy consisted of a few big blocks
whose relationships were negotiated in back rooms by a handful of
executives, politicians, regulators, and labor leaders.  Version 2
was higher resolution: there were more companies, of more different
sizes, making more different things, and their relationships changed
faster. In this world there were still plenty of back room negotiations,
but more was left to market forces.  Which further accelerated the
fragmentation.<br><br>It's a little misleading to talk of versions when describing a
gradual process, but not as misleading as it might seem.  There was
a lot of change in a few decades, and what we ended up with was
qualitatively different.  The companies in the S&amp;P 500 in 1958 had
been there an average of 61 years. By 2012 that number was 18 years.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f18n"><font color="#999999">18</font></a>]</font><br><br>The breakup of the Duplo economy happened simultaneously with the
spread of computing power. To what extent were computers a precondition?
It would take a book to answer that. Obviously the spread of computing
power was a precondition for the rise of startups.  I suspect it
was for most of what happened in finance too.  But was it a
precondition for globalization or the LBO wave?  I don't know, but
I wouldn't discount the possibility.  It may be that the refragmentation
was driven by computers in the way the industrial revolution was
driven by steam engines.  Whether or not computers were a precondition,
they have certainly accelerated it.<br><br>The new fluidity of companies changed people's relationships with
their employers. Why climb a corporate ladder that might be yanked
out from under you?  Ambitious people started to think of a career
less as climbing a single ladder than as a series of jobs that might
be at different companies. More movement (or even potential movement)
between companies introduced more competition in salaries.  Plus
as companies became smaller it became easier to estimate how much
an employee contributed to the company's revenue.  Both changes
drove salaries toward market price. And since people vary dramatically
in productivity, paying market price meant salaries started to
diverge.<br><br>By no coincidence it was in the early 1980s that the term "yuppie"
was coined.  That word is not much used now, because the phenomenon
it describes is so taken for granted, but at the time it was a label
for something novel. Yuppies were young professionals who made lots
of money.  To someone in their twenties today, this wouldn't seem
worth naming.  Why wouldn't young professionals make lots of money?
But until the 1980s, being underpaid early in your career was part
of what it meant to be a professional.  Young professionals were
paying their dues, working their way up the ladder.  The rewards
would come later.  What was novel about yuppies was that they wanted
market price for the work they were doing now.<br><br>The first yuppies did not work for startups. That was still in the
future.  Nor did they work for big companies. They were professionals
working in fields like law, finance, and consulting.  But their example 
rapidly inspired their peers.  Once they saw that new BMW 325i, they 
wanted one too.<br><br>Underpaying people at the beginning of their career only works if
everyone does it. Once some employer breaks ranks, everyone else
has to, or they can't get good people.  And once started this process
spreads through the whole economy, because at the beginnings of
people's careers they can easily switch not merely employers but
industries.<br><br>But not all young professionals benefitted. You had to produce to
get paid a lot.  It was no coincidence that the first yuppies worked
in fields where it was easy to measure that.<br><br>More generally, an idea was returning whose name sounds old-fashioned
precisely because it was so rare for so long: that you could make
your fortune.  As in the past there were multiple ways to do it.
Some made their fortunes by creating wealth, and others by playing
zero-sum games. But once it became possible to make one's fortune,
the ambitious had to decide whether or not to.  A physicist who
chose physics over Wall Street in 1990 was making a sacrifice that
a physicist in 1960 didn't have to think about.<br><br>The idea even flowed back into big companies.  CEOs of big companies
make more now than they used to, and I think much of the reason is
prestige.  In 1960, corporate CEOs had immense prestige.  They were
the winners of the only economic game in town. But if they made as
little now as they did then, in real dollar terms, they'd seem like
small fry compared to professional athletes and whiz kids making
millions from startups and hedge funds. They don't like that idea,
so now they try to get as much as they can, which is more than they
had been getting. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f19n"><font color="#999999">19</font></a>]</font><br><br>Meanwhile a similar fragmentation was happening at the other end
of the economic scale.  As big companies' oligopolies became less
secure, they were less able to pass costs on to customers and thus
less willing to overpay for labor.  And as the Duplo world of a few
big blocks fragmented into many companies of different sizes — some
of them overseas — it became harder for unions to enforce their
monopolies.  As a result workers' wages also tended toward market
price. Which (inevitably, if unions had been doing their job) tended
to be lower.  Perhaps dramatically so, if automation had decreased
the need for some kind of work.<br><br>And just as the mid-century model induced social as well as economic
cohesion, its breakup brought social as well as economic fragmentation.
People started to dress and act differently.  Those who would later
be called the "creative class" became more mobile. People who didn't
care much for religion felt less pressure to go to church for
appearances' sake, while those who liked it a lot opted for
increasingly colorful forms. Some switched from meat loaf to tofu,
and others to Hot Pockets. Some switched from driving Ford sedans
to driving small imported cars, and others to driving SUVs.  Kids
who went to private schools or wished they did started to dress
"preppy," and kids who wanted to seem rebellious made a conscious
effort to look disreputable.  In a hundred ways people spread apart.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f20n"><font color="#999999">20</font></a>]</font><br><br>Almost four decades later, fragmentation is still increasing.  Has
it been net good or bad?  I don't know; the question may be
unanswerable.  Not entirely bad though.  We take for granted the
forms of fragmentation we like, and worry only about the ones we
don't. But as someone who caught the tail end of mid-century
<a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=well-adjusted&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3"><u>conformism</u></a>, 
I can tell you it was no utopia.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f21n"><font color="#999999">21</font></a>]</font><br><br>My goal here is not to say whether fragmentation has been good or
bad, just to explain why it's happening.  With the centripetal
forces of total war and 20th century oligopoly mostly gone, what
will happen next?  And more specifically, is it possible to reverse
some of the fragmentation we've seen?<br><br>If it is, it will have to happen piecemeal.  You can't reproduce
mid-century cohesion the way it was originally produced.  It would
be insane to go to war just to induce more national unity.  And
once you understand the degree to which the economic history of the
20th century was a low-res version 1, it's clear you can't reproduce
that either.<br><br>20th century cohesion was something that happened at least in a
sense naturally.  The war was due mostly to external forces, and
the Duplo economy was an evolutionary phase.  If you want cohesion
now, you'd have to induce it deliberately.  And it's not obvious
how.  I suspect the best we'll be able to do is address the symptoms
of fragmentation.  But that may be enough.<br><br>The form of fragmentation people worry most about lately is <a href="ineq.html"><u>economic inequality</u></a>, and if you want to eliminate
that you're up against a truly formidable headwind that has
been in operation since the stone age. Technology.<br><br>Technology is
a lever. It magnifies work.  And the lever not only grows increasingly
long, but the rate at which it grows is itself increasing.<br><br>Which in turn means the variation in the amount of wealth people
can create has not only been increasing, but accelerating.  The
unusual conditions that prevailed in the mid 20th century masked
this underlying trend.  The ambitious had little choice but to join
large organizations that made them march in step with lots of other
people — literally in the case of the armed forces, figuratively
in the case of big corporations. Even if the big corporations had
wanted to pay people proportionate to their value, they couldn't
have figured out how.  But that constraint has gone now.  Ever since
it started to erode in the 1970s, we've seen the underlying forces
at work again.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f22n"><font color="#999999">22</font></a>]</font><br><br>Not everyone who gets rich now does it by creating wealth, certainly.
But a significant number do, and the Baumol Effect means all their
peers get dragged along too.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f23n"><font color="#999999">23</font></a>]</font>
And as long as it's possible to
get rich by creating wealth, the default tendency will be for
economic inequality to increase.  Even if you eliminate all the
other ways to get rich.  You can mitigate this with subsidies at
the bottom and taxes at the top, but unless taxes are high enough
to discourage people from creating wealth, you're always going to
be fighting a losing battle against increasing variation in
productivity.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f24n"><font color="#999999">24</font></a>]</font><br><br>That form of fragmentation, like the others, is here to stay.  Or
rather, back to stay.  Nothing is forever, but the tendency toward
fragmentation should be more forever than most things, precisely
because it's not due to any particular cause.  It's simply a reversion
to the mean. When Rockefeller said individualism was gone, he was
right for a hundred years.  It's back now, and that's likely to be
true for longer.<br><br>I worry that if we don't acknowledge this, we're headed for trouble.
If we think 20th century cohesion disappeared because of few policy
tweaks, we'll be deluded into thinking we can get it back (minus
the bad parts, somehow) with a few countertweaks.  And then we'll
waste our time trying to eliminate fragmentation, when we'd be
better off thinking about how to mitigate its consequences.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Lester Thurow, writing in 1975, said the wage differentials
prevailing at the end of World War II had become so embedded that
they "were regarded as 'just' even after the egalitarian pressures
of World War II had disappeared.  Basically, the same differentials
exist to this day, thirty years later." But Goldin and Margo think
market forces in the postwar period also helped preserve the wartime
compression of wages — specifically increased demand for unskilled
workers, and oversupply of educated ones.<br><br>(Oddly enough, the American custom of having employers pay for
health insurance derives from efforts by businesses to circumvent
NWLB wage controls in order to attract workers.)<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
As always, tax rates don't tell the whole story.  There were
lots of exemptions, especially for individuals.  And in World War
II the tax codes were so new that the government had little acquired
immunity to tax avoidance.  If the rich paid high taxes during the
war it was more because they wanted to than because they had to.<br><br>After the war, federal tax receipts as a percentage of GDP were
about the same as they are now. In fact, for the entire period since
the war, tax receipts have stayed close to 18% of GDP, despite
dramatic changes in tax rates.  The lowest point occurred when
marginal income tax rates were highest: 14.1% in 1950.  Looking at
the data, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that tax rates have had
little effect on what people actually paid.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Though in fact the decade preceding the war had been a time
of unprecedented federal power, in response to the Depression.
Which is not entirely a coincidence, because the Depression was one
of the causes of the war.  In many ways the New Deal was a sort of
dress rehearsal for the measures the federal government took during
wartime.  The wartime versions were much more drastic and more
pervasive though.  As Anthony Badger wrote, "for many Americans the
decisive change in their experiences came not with the New Deal but
with World War II."<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
I don't know enough about the origins of the world wars to
say, but it's not inconceivable they were connected to the rise of
big corporations. If that were the case, 20th century cohesion would
have a single cause.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
More precisely, there was a bimodal economy consisting, in
Galbraith's words, of "the world of the technically dynamic, massively
capitalized and highly organized corporations on the one hand and
the hundreds of thousands of small and traditional proprietors on
the other." Money, prestige, and power were concentrated in the
former, and there was near zero crossover.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]

I didn't realize it till I started doing research for this
essay, but the meretriciousness of the products I grew up with is

Monroeville Mall was at the time of its completion in 1969
the largest in the country. In the late 1970s the movie <i>Dawn of
the Dead</i> was shot there. Apparently the mall was not just the
location of the movie, but its inspiration; the crowds of shoppers
drifting through this huge mall reminded George Romero of zombies.

Labor unions were exempted from antitrust laws by the Clayton
Antitrust Act in 1914 on the grounds that a person's work is not
"a commodity or article of commerce." I wonder if that means service
companies are also exempt.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
The relationships between unions and unionized companies can
even be symbiotic, because unions will exert political pressure to
protect their hosts.  According to Michael Lind, when politicians
tried to attack the A&amp;P supermarket chain because it was putting
local grocery stores out of business, "A&amp;P successfully defended
itself by allowing the unionization of its workforce in 1938, thereby
gaining organized labor as a constituency." I've seen this phenomenon
myself: hotel unions are responsible for more of the political
pressure against Airbnb than hotel companies.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
Galbraith was clearly puzzled that corporate executives would
work so hard to make money for other people (the shareholders)
instead of themselves.  He devoted much of <i>The New Industrial
State</i> to trying to figure this out.<br><br>His theory was that professionalism had replaced money as a motive,
and that modern corporate executives were, like (good) scientists,
motivated less by financial rewards than by the desire to do good
work and thereby earn the respect of their peers.  There is something
in this, though I think lack of movement between companies combined
with self-interest explains much of observed behavior.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
Galbraith (p. 94) says a 1952 study of the 800 highest paid
executives at 300 big corporations found that three quarters of
them had been with their company for more than 20 years.<br><br>[<a name="f14n"><font color="#000000">14</font></a>]
It seems likely that in the first third of the 20th century
executive salaries were low partly because companies then were more
dependent on banks, who would have disapproved if executives got
too much.  This was certainly true in the beginning. The first big
company CEOs were J. P. Morgan's hired hands.<br><br>Companies didn't start to finance themselves with retained earnings
till the 1920s.  Till then they had to pay out their earnings in
dividends, and so depended on banks for capital for expansion.
Bankers continued to sit on corporate boards till the Glass-Steagall
act in 1933.<br><br>By mid-century big companies funded 3/4 of their growth from earnings.
But the early years of bank dependence, reinforced by the financial
controls of World War II, must have had a big effect on social
conventions about executive salaries.  So it may be that the lack
of movement between companies was as much the effect of low salaries
as the cause.<br><br>Incidentally, the switch in the 1920s to financing growth with
retained earnings was one cause of the 1929 crash.  The banks now
had to find someone else to lend to, so they made more margin loans.<br><br>[<a name="f15n"><font color="#000000">15</font></a>]
Even now it's hard to get them to. One of the things I find
hardest to get into the heads of would-be startup founders is how
important it is to do certain kinds of menial work early in the
life of a company.  Doing <a href="ds.html"><u>things that don't
scale</u></a> is to how Henry Ford got started as a high-fiber diet is
to the traditional peasant's diet: they had no choice but to do the
right thing, while we have to make a conscious effort.<br><br>[<a name="f16n"><font color="#000000">16</font></a>]
Founders weren't celebrated in the press when I was a kid.
"Our founder" meant a photograph of a severe-looking man with a
walrus mustache and a wing collar who had died decades ago. The
thing to be when I was a kid was an <i>executive</i>. If you weren't
around then it's hard to grasp the cachet that term had. The fancy
version of everything was called the "executive" model.<br><br>[<a name="f17n"><font color="#000000">17</font></a>]
The wave of hostile takeovers in the 1980s was enabled by a
combination of circumstances: court decisions striking down state
anti-takeover laws, starting with the Supreme Court's 1982 decision
in Edgar v. MITE Corp.; the Reagan administration's comparatively
sympathetic attitude toward takeovers; the Depository Institutions
Act of 1982, which allowed banks and savings and loans to buy
corporate bonds; a new SEC rule issued in 1982 (rule 415) that made
it possible to bring corporate bonds to market faster; the creation
of the junk bond business by Michael Milken; a vogue for conglomerates
in the preceding period that caused many companies to be combined
that never should have been; a decade of inflation that left many
public companies trading below the value of their assets; and not
least, the increasing complacency of managements.<br><br>[<a name="f18n"><font color="#000000">18</font></a>]

CEOs of big companies may be overpaid. I don't know enough
about big companies to say. But it is certainly not impossible for
a CEO to make 200x as much difference to a company's revenues as
the average employee.  Look at what Steve Jobs did for Apple when
he came back as CEO.  It would have been a good deal for the board
to give him 95% of the company.  Apple's market cap the day Steve
came back in July 1997 was 1.73 billion. 5% of Apple now (January
2016) would be worth about 30 billion.  And it would not be if Steve
hadn't come back; Apple probably wouldn't even exist anymore.<br><br>Merely including Steve in the sample might be enough to answer the
question of whether public company CEOs in the aggregate are overpaid.
And that is not as facile a trick as it might seem, because the
broader your holdings, the more the aggregate is what you care
about.<br><br>[<a name="f20n"><font color="#000000">20</font></a>]
The late 1960s were famous for social upheaval. But that was
more rebellion (which can happen in any era if people are provoked
sufficiently) than fragmentation.  You're not seeing fragmentation
unless you see people breaking off to both left and right.<br><br>[<a name="f21n"><font color="#000000">21</font></a>]
Globally the trend has been in the other direction.  While

There were a handful of ways to make a fortune in the mid
20th century.  The main one was drilling for oil, which was open
to newcomers because it was not something big companies could
dominate through economies of scale.  How did individuals accumulate
large fortunes in an era of such high taxes?  Giant tax loopholes
defended by two of the most powerful men in Congress, Sam Rayburn
and Lyndon Johnson.<br><br>But becoming a Texas oilman was not in 1950 something one could
aspire to the way starting a startup or going to work on Wall Street
were in 2000, because (a) there was a strong local component and
(b) success depended so much on luck.<br><br>[<a name="f23n"><font color="#000000">23</font></a>]
The Baumol Effect induced by startups is very visible in
Silicon Valley.  Google will pay people millions of dollars a year
to keep them from leaving to start or join startups.<br><br>[<a name="f24n"><font color="#000000">24</font></a>]
I'm not claiming variation in productivity is the only cause
of economic inequality in the US. But it's a significant cause, and
it will become as big a cause as it needs to, in the sense that if
you ban other ways to get rich, people who want to get rich will
use this route instead.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Patrick

<p> -->
January 2016<br><br>Since the 1970s, economic inequality in the US has increased
dramatically. And in particular, the rich have gotten a lot richer.
Nearly everyone who writes about the topic says that economic inequality
should be decreased.<br><br>I'm interested in this question because I was one of the founders of
a company called Y Combinator that helps people start startups.
Almost by definition, if a startup succeeds, its founders become
rich. Which means by helping startup founders I've been helping to
increase economic inequality.  If economic inequality should be 
decreased, I shouldn't be helping founders. No one should
be.<br><br>But that doesn't sound right. What's going on here? What's going
on is that while economic inequality is a single measure (or more
precisely, two: variation in income, and variation in wealth), it
has multiple causes. Many of these causes are bad, like tax loopholes
and drug addiction. But some are good, like Larry Page and
Sergey Brin starting the company you use to find things online.<br><br>If you want to understand economic inequality — and more importantly,
if you actually want to fix the bad aspects of it — you have to
tease apart the components.  And yet the trend in nearly everything
written about the subject is to do the opposite: to squash together
all the aspects of economic inequality as if it were a single
phenomenon.<br><br>Sometimes this is done for ideological reasons.  Sometimes it's
because the writer only has very high-level data and so draws
conclusions from that, like the proverbial drunk who looks for his
keys under the lamppost, instead of where he dropped them, because the
light is better there.  Sometimes it's because the writer doesn't
understand critical aspects of inequality, like the role of technology
in wealth creation.  Much of the time, perhaps most of the time,
writing about economic inequality combines all three.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>The most common mistake people make about economic inequality is
to treat it as a single phenomenon.  The most naive version of which
is the one based on the pie fallacy: that the rich get rich by
taking money from the poor.<br><br>Usually this is an assumption people start from rather than a
conclusion they arrive at by examining the evidence.  Sometimes the
pie fallacy is stated explicitly:
<blockquote>
  ...those at the top are grabbing an increasing fraction of the
  nation's income — so much of a larger share that what's left over
  for the rest is diminished....
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
Other times it's more unconscious. But the unconscious form is very
widespread.  I think because we grow up in a world where the pie
fallacy is actually true.  To kids, wealth <i>is</i> a fixed pie
that's shared out, and if one person gets more, it's at the expense
of another.  It takes a conscious effort to remind oneself that the
real world doesn't work that way.<br><br>In the real world you can create wealth as well as taking it from
others.  A woodworker creates wealth.  He makes a chair, and you
willingly give him money in return for it.  A high-frequency trader
does not.  He makes a dollar only when someone on the other end of
a trade loses a dollar.<br><br>If the rich people in a society got that way by taking wealth from
the poor, then you have the degenerate case of economic inequality,
where the cause of poverty is the same as the cause of wealth.  But
instances of inequality don't have to be instances of the degenerate
case.  If one woodworker makes 5 chairs and another makes none, the
second woodworker will have less money, but not because anyone took
anything from him.<br><br>Even people sophisticated enough to know about the pie fallacy are
led toward it by the custom of describing economic inequality as a
ratio of one quantile's income or wealth to another's.  It's so
easy to slip from talking about income shifting from one quantile
to another, as a figure of speech, into believing that is literally
what's happening.<br><br>Except in the degenerate case, economic inequality can't be described
by a ratio or even a curve.  In the general case it consists of
multiple ways people become poor, and multiple ways people become
rich.  Which means to understand economic inequality in a country,
you have to go find individual people who are poor or rich and
figure out why.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you want to understand <i>change</i> in economic inequality, you
should ask what those people would have done when it was different.
This is one way I know the rich aren't all getting richer simply
from some new system for transferring wealth to them from
everyone else.  When you use the would-have method with startup
founders, you find what most would have done 
<a href="re.html"><u>back in 1960</u></a>, when
economic inequality was lower, was to join big companies or become
professors.  Before Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook, his default
expectation was that he'd end up working at Microsoft.  The reason
he and most other startup founders are richer than they would have
been in the mid 20th century is not because of some right turn the
country took during the Reagan administration, but because progress
in technology has made it much easier to start a new company that
<a href="growth.html"><u>grows fast</u></a>.<br><br>Traditional economists seem strangely averse to studying individual
humans. It seems to be a rule with them that everything has to start
with statistics.  So they give you very precise numbers about
variation in wealth and income, then follow it with the most naive
speculation about the underlying causes.<br><br>But while there are a lot of people who get rich through rent-seeking
of various forms, and a lot who get rich by playing zero-sum games, 
there are also a significant number
who get rich by creating wealth.  And creating wealth, as a source
of economic inequality, is different from taking it — not just
morally, but also practically, in the sense that it is harder to
eradicate.  One reason is that variation in productivity is
accelerating.  The rate at which individuals can create wealth
depends on the technology available to them, and that grows
exponentially. The other reason creating wealth is such a tenacious
source of inequality is that it can expand to accommodate a lot of
people.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>I'm all for shutting down the crooked ways to get rich.  But that
won't eliminate great variations in wealth, because as long as you leave
open the option of getting rich by creating wealth, people who want
to get rich will do that instead.<br><br>Most people who get rich tend to be fairly driven. Whatever their
other flaws, laziness is usually not one of them.  Suppose new
policies make it hard to make a fortune in finance. Does it seem
plausible that the people who currently go into finance to make
their fortunes will continue to do so, but be content to work for
ordinary salaries? The reason they go into finance is not because
they love finance but because they want to get rich. If the only
way left to get rich is to start startups, they'll start startups.
They'll do well at it too, because determination is the main factor
in the success of a startup. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
And while it would probably be
a good thing for the world if people who wanted to get rich switched
from playing zero-sum games to creating wealth, that would not only
not eliminate great variations in wealth, but might even 
exacerbate them.
In a zero-sum game there is at least a limit to the upside.  Plus
a lot of the new startups would create new technology that further
accelerated variation in productivity.<br><br>Variation in productivity is far from the only source of economic
inequality, but it is the irreducible core of it, in the sense that
you'll have that left when you eliminate all other sources. And if
you do, that core will be big, because it will have expanded to
include the efforts of all the refugees.  Plus it will have a large
Baumol penumbra around it: anyone who could get rich by creating
wealth on their own account will have to be paid enough to prevent
them from doing it.<br><br>You can't prevent great variations in wealth without preventing people
from getting rich, and you can't do that without preventing them
from starting startups.<br><br>So let's be clear about that. Eliminating great variations in wealth would
mean eliminating startups.  And that doesn't seem a wise move.
Especially since it would only mean you eliminated
startups in your own country.  Ambitious people already move halfway
around the world to further their careers, and startups can operate
from anywhere nowadays.  So if you made it impossible to get rich
by creating wealth in your country, people who wanted to do that
would just leave and do it somewhere else. Which would
certainly get you a lower Gini coefficient, along with a lesson in
being careful what you ask for. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>I think rising economic inequality is the inevitable fate of countries
that don't choose something worse. We had a 40 year stretch in the
middle of the 20th century that convinced some people otherwise.
But as I explained in <a href="re.html"><u>The Refragmentation</u></a>,
that was an anomaly — a
unique combination of circumstances that compressed American society
not just economically but culturally too.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>And while some of the growth in economic inequality we've seen since
then has been due to bad behavior of various kinds, there has
simultaneously been a huge increase in individuals' ability to
create wealth.  Startups are almost entirely a product of this
period. And even within the startup world, there has been a qualitative
change in the last 10 years.  Technology has decreased the cost of
starting a startup so much that founders now have the upper hand
over investors.  Founders get less diluted, and it is now common
for them to retain 
<a href="control.html"><u>board control</u></a> as well.  Both further increase
economic inequality, the former because founders own more stock,
and the latter because, as investors have learned, founders tend
to be better at running their companies than investors.<br><br>While the surface manifestations change, the underlying forces are
very, very old.  The acceleration of productivity we see in Silicon
Valley has been happening for thousands of years.  If you look at
the history of stone tools, technology was already accelerating in
the Mesolithic.  The acceleration would have been too slow to
perceive in one lifetime.  Such is the nature of the leftmost part
of an exponential curve.  But it was the same curve.<br><br>You do not want to design your society in a way that's incompatible
with this curve. The evolution of technology is one of the most
powerful forces in history.<br><br>Louis Brandeis said "We may have democracy, or we may have wealth
concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both." That
sounds plausible.  But if I have to choose between ignoring him and
ignoring an exponential curve that has been operating for thousands
of years, I'll bet on the curve.  Ignoring any trend that has been
operating for thousands of years is dangerous.  But exponential
growth, especially, tends to bite you.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>If accelerating variation in productivity is always going to produce
some baseline growth in economic inequality, it would be a good
idea to spend some time thinking about that future.  Can you have
a healthy society with great variation in wealth?  What would it
look like?<br><br>Notice how novel it feels to think about that.  The public conversation
so far has been exclusively about the need to decrease economic
inequality.  We've barely given a thought to how to live with it.<br><br>I'm hopeful we'll be able to.  Brandeis was a product of the Gilded
Age, and things have changed since then. It's harder to hide
wrongdoing now.  And to get rich now you don't have to buy politicians
the way railroad or oil magnates did. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font>
The great concentrations
of wealth I see around me in Silicon Valley don't seem to be
destroying democracy.<br><br>There are lots of things wrong with the US that have economic
inequality as a symptom. We should fix those things.  In the process
we may decrease economic inequality. But we can't start from the
symptom and hope to fix the underlying causes.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>The most obvious is poverty. I'm sure most of those who want to
decrease economic inequality want to do it mainly to help the poor,
not to hurt the rich. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font>
Indeed, a good number are merely being
sloppy by speaking of decreasing economic inequality when what they
mean is decreasing poverty.  But this is a situation where it would
be good to be precise about what we want.  Poverty and economic
inequality are not identical.  When the city is turning off your
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/07/what-happens-when-detroit-shuts-off-the-water-of-100000-people/374548/"><u>water</u></a>
because you can't pay the bill, it doesn't make any difference
what Larry Page's net worth is compared to yours.  He might only
be a few times richer than you, and it would still be just as much
of a problem that your water was getting turned off.<br><br>Closely related to poverty is lack of social mobility.  I've seen
this myself: you don't have to grow up rich or even upper middle
class to get rich as a startup founder, but few successful founders
grew up desperately poor.  But again, the problem here is not simply
economic inequality.  There is an enormous difference in wealth
between the household Larry Page grew up in and that of a successful
startup founder, but that didn't prevent him from joining their
ranks.  It's not economic inequality per se that's blocking social
mobility, but some specific combination of things that go wrong
when kids grow up sufficiently poor.<br><br>One of the most important principles in Silicon Valley is that "you
make what you measure."  It means that if you pick some number to
focus on, it will tend to improve, but that you have to choose the
right number, because only the one you choose will improve; another
that seems conceptually adjacent might not.  For example, if you're
a university president and you decide to focus on graduation rates,
then you'll improve graduation rates.  But only graduation rates,
not how much students learn.  Students could learn less, if to
improve graduation rates you made classes easier.<br><br>Economic inequality is sufficiently far from identical with the
various problems that have it as a symptom that we'll probably only
hit whichever of the two we aim at.  If we aim at economic inequality,
we won't fix these problems.  So I say let's aim at the problems.<br><br>For example, let's attack poverty, and if necessary damage wealth
in the process. That's much more likely to work than attacking
wealth in the hope that you will thereby fix poverty.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font>
And if
there are people getting rich by tricking consumers or lobbying the
government for anti-competitive regulations or tax loopholes, then
let's stop them. Not because it's causing economic inequality, but
because it's stealing.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>If all you have is statistics, it seems like that's what you need
to fix. But behind a broad statistical measure like economic
inequality there are some things that are good and some that are
bad, some that are historical trends with immense momentum and
others that are random accidents.  If we want to fix the world
behind the statistics, we have to understand it, and focus our
efforts where they'll do the most good.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]

Particularly since economic inequality is a matter of outliers,
and outliers are disproportionately likely to have gotten where
they are by ways that have little do with the sort of things
economists usually think about, like wages and productivity, but
rather by, say, ending up on the wrong side of the "War on Drugs."<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Determination is the most important factor in deciding between
success and failure, which in startups tend to be sharply differentiated.
But it takes more than determination to create one of the hugely
successful startups.  Though most founders start out excited about
the idea of getting rich, purely mercenary founders will usually
take one of the big acquisition offers most successful startups get
on the way up.  The founders who go on to the next stage tend to
be driven by a sense of mission.  They have the same attachment to
their companies that an artist or writer has to their work.  But
it is very hard to predict at the outset which founders will do
that. It's not simply a function of their initial attitude.  Starting
a company changes people.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
After reading a draft of this essay, Richard Florida told me
how he had once talked to a group of Europeans "who said
 they wanted to make Europe more entrepreneurial and more
  like Silicon Valley. I said by definition this will give you more
  inequality.  They thought I was insane — they could not process
  it."<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Economic inequality has been decreasing globally.  But this
is mainly due to the erosion of the kleptocracies that formerly
dominated all the poorer countries.  Once the playing field is
leveler politically, we'll see economic inequality start to rise
again. The US is the bellwether.  The situation we face here, the
rest of the world will sooner or later.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Some people still get rich by buying politicians.  My point is that
it's no longer a precondition.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
As well as problems that have economic inequality as a symptom,
there are those that have it as a cause.  But in most if not all,
economic inequality is not the primary cause.  There is usually
some injustice that is allowing economic inequality to turn into
other forms of inequality, and that injustice is what we need to
fix.  For example, the police in the US treat the poor worse than
the rich.  But the solution is not to make people richer. It's to
make the police treat people more equitably.  Otherwise they'll
continue to maltreat people who are weak in other ways.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Some who read this essay will say that I'm clueless or even
being deliberately misleading by focusing so much on the richer end
of economic inequality — that economic inequality is really about
poverty. But that is exactly the point I'm making, though sloppier
language than I'd use to make it.  The real problem is poverty, not
economic inequality.  And if you conflate them you're aiming at the
wrong target.<br><br>Others will say I'm clueless or being misleading by focusing on
people who get rich by creating wealth — that startups aren't the
problem, but corrupt practices in finance, healthcare, and so on.
Once again, that is exactly my point.  The problem is not economic
inequality, but those specific abuses.<br><br>It's a strange task to write an essay about why something isn't the
problem, but that's the situation you find yourself in when so many
people mistakenly think it is.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Particularly since many causes of poverty are only partially
driven by people trying to make money from them. For example,
America's abnormally high incarceration rate is a major cause of
poverty.  But although <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/28/how-for-profit-prisons-have-become-the-biggest-lobby-no-one-is-talking-about/"><u>for-profit prison companies</u></a> and 
<a href="http://mic.com/articles/41531/union-of-the-snake-how-california-s-prison-guards-subvert-democracy"><u>prison guard unions</u></a> both spend 
a lot lobbying for harsh sentencing laws, they
are not the original source of them.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
Incidentally, tax loopholes are definitely not a product
of some power shift due to recent increases in economic inequality.
The golden age of economic equality in the mid 20th century was
also the golden age of tax avoidance. Indeed, it was so widespread
and so effective that I'm skeptical whether economic inequality was
really so low then as we think.  In a period when people are trying
to hide wealth from the government, it will tend to be hidden from
statistics too. One sign of the potential magnitude of the problem
is the discrepancy between government receipts as a percentage of
GDP, which have remained more or less constant during the entire
period from the end of World War II to the present, and tax rates,
which have varied dramatically.<br><br>

When I was a kid I used to wonder
about this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining
about its finiteness?  Would we be just as likely to feel life was
short if we lived 10 times as long?<br><br>Since there didn't seem any way to answer this question, I stopped
wondering about it.  Then I had kids.  That gave me a way to answer
the question, and the answer is that life actually is short.<br><br>Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time,
into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year
old.  If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only
get to watch your child experience it 8 times.  And while it's
impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity
like time, 8 is not a lot of something.  If you had a handful of 8
peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would
definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.<br><br>Ok, so life actually is short.  Does it make any difference to know
that?<br><br>It has for me.  It means arguments of the form "Life is too short
for x" have great force.  It's not just a figure of speech to say
that life is too short for something.  It's not just a synonym for
annoying.  If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for
something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.<br><br>When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word
that pops into my head is "bullshit." I realize that answer is
somewhat tautological.  It's almost the definition of bullshit that
it's the stuff that life is too short for.  And yet bullshit does
have a distinctive character.  There's something fake about it.
It's the junk food of experience.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit,
you probably already know the answer.  Unnecessary meetings, pointless
disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's
mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.<br><br>There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's
either forced on you, or it tricks you.  To some extent you have to
put up with the bullshit forced on you by circumstances.  You need
to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands.  Indeed,
the law of supply and demand ensures that: the more rewarding some
kind of work is, the cheaper people will do it.  It may be that
less bullshit is forced on you than you think, though.  There has
always been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and
go live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional
sense, but life feels more authentic.  This could become more common.<br><br>You can do it on a smaller scale without moving.  The amount of
time you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers.  Most
large organizations (and many small ones) are steeped in it.  But
if you consciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factors
like money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will
waste less of your time.<br><br>If you're a freelancer or a small company, you can do this at the
level of individual customers.  If you fire or avoid toxic customers,
you can decrease the amount of bullshit in your life by more than
you decrease your income.<br><br>But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the
bullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's
fault but your own.  And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder
to eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you.  Things that
lure you into wasting your time have to be really good at
tricking you.  An example that will be familiar to a lot of people
is arguing online.  When someone
contradicts you, they're in a sense attacking you. Sometimes pretty
overtly.  Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself.  But
like a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we
now live in.  Counterintuitive as it feels, it's better most of
the time not to defend yourself.  Otherwise these people are literally
taking your life.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Arguing online is only incidentally addictive. There are more
dangerous things than that. As I've written before, one byproduct
of technical progress is that things we like tend to become <a href="addiction.html"><u>more
addictive</u></a>.  Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious
effort to avoid addictions � to stand outside ourselves and ask "is
this how I want to be spending my time?"<br><br>As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things
that matter.  But different things matter to different people, and
most have to learn what matters to them.  A few are lucky and realize
early on that they love math or taking care of animals or writing,
and then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it.  But
most people start out with a life that's a mix of things that
matter and things that don't, and only gradually learn to distinguish
between them.<br><br>For the young especially, much of this confusion is induced by the
artificial situations they find themselves in. In middle school and
high school, what the other kids think of you seems the most important
thing in the world.  But when you ask adults what they got wrong
at that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kids
thought of them.<br><br>One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask
yourself whether you'll care about it in the future.  Fake stuff
that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter.  That's
how it tricks you.  The area under the curve is small, but its shape
jabs into your consciousness like a pin.<br><br>The things that matter aren't necessarily the ones people would
call "important."  Having coffee with a friend matters.  You won't
feel later like that was a waste of time.<br><br>One great thing about having small children is that they make you
spend time on things that matter: them. They grab your sleeve as
you're staring at your phone and say "will you play with me?" And
odds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option.<br><br>If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by
surprise. And that is just what tends to happen.  You take things
for granted, and then they're gone.  You think you can always write
that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize
the window has closed.  The saddest windows close when other people
die. Their lives are short too.  After my mother died, I wished I'd
spent more time with her.  I lived as if she'd always be there.
And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion.  But an
illusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I
did.<br><br>The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to
be consciously aware of it.  Back when life was more precarious,
people used to be aware of death to a degree that would now seem a
bit morbid.  I'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the right answer
to be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at
everyone's shoulder.  Perhaps a better solution is to look at the
problem from the other end. Cultivate a habit of impatience about
the things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that
mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother.  You don't
need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait.
Just don't wait.<br><br>I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much
of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has.  Both
make sense here.<br><br>How you live affects how long you live.  Most people could do better.
Me among them.<br><br>But you can probably get even more effect by paying closer attention
to the time you have.  It's easy to let the days rush by.  The
"flow" that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousin
that prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurry
of errands and alarms.  One of the most striking things I've read
was not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter's <i>Burning
the Days</i>.<br><br>It is possible to slow time somewhat. I've gotten better at it.
Kids help.  When you have small children, there are a lot of moments
so perfect that you can't help noticing.<br><br>It does help too to feel that you've squeezed everything out of
some experience.  The reason I'm sad about my mother is not just
that I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have
done that we didn't.  My oldest son will be 7 soon.  And while I
miss the 3 year old version of him, I at least don't have any regrets
over what might have been.  We had the best time a daddy and a 3
year old ever had.<br><br>Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter,
and savor the time you have.  That's what you do when life is short.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
At first I didn't like it that the word that came to mind was
one that had other meanings.  But then I realized the other meanings
are fairly closely related.  Bullshit in the sense of things you
waste your time on is a lot like intellectual bullshit.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
I chose this example deliberately as a note to self.  I get
attacked a lot online.  People tell the craziest lies about me.
And I have so far done a pretty mediocre job of suppressing the
natural human inclination to say "Hey, that's not true!"<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts

Much of it will apply to other towns.  But not all, because
as I say in the talk, Pittsburgh has some important advantages over
most would-be startup hubs.)</i><br><br>What would it take to make Pittsburgh into a startup hub, like
Silicon Valley?  I understand Pittsburgh pretty well,
because I grew up here, in Monroeville. And I understand Silicon
Valley pretty well because that's where I live now.  Could you get
that kind of startup ecosystem going here?<br><br>When I agreed to speak here, I didn't think I'd be able to give a
very optimistic talk.  I thought I'd be talking about what Pittsburgh
could do to become a startup hub, very much in the subjunctive.
Instead I'm going to talk about what Pittsburgh can do.<br><br>What changed my mind was an article I read in, of all places, the <i>New
York Times</i> food section.  The title was "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/dining/pittsburgh-restaurants.html"><u>Pittsburgh's Youth-Driven
Food Boom</u></a>."  To most people that might not even sound interesting,
let alone something related to startups.  But it was electrifying
to me to read that title.  I don't think I could pick a more promising
one if I tried.  And when I read the article I got even more excited.
It said "people ages 25 to 29 now make up 7.6 percent of all
residents, up from 7 percent about a decade ago."  Wow, I thought,
Pittsburgh could be the next Portland.  It could become the cool
place all the people in their twenties want to go live.<br><br>When I got here a couple days ago, I could feel the difference.  I
lived here from 1968 to 1984.  I didn't realize it at the time, but
during that whole period the city was in free fall. On top of the
flight to the suburbs that happened everywhere, the steel and nuclear
businesses were both dying. Boy are things different now.  It's not
just that downtown seems a lot more prosperous. There is an energy
here that was not here when I was a kid.<br><br>When I was a kid, this was a place young people left. Now it's a
place that attracts them.<br><br>What does that have to do with startups?  Startups are made
of people, and the average age of the people in a typical startup
is right in that 25 to 29 bracket.<br><br>I've seen how powerful it is for a city to have those people.  Five
years ago they shifted the center of gravity of Silicon Valley from
the peninsula to San Francisco.  Google and Facebook are on the
peninsula, but the next generation of big winners are all in SF.
The reason the center of gravity shifted was the talent war, for
programmers especially.  Most 25 to 29 year olds want to live in
the city, not down in the boring suburbs.  So whether they like it
or not, founders know they have to be in the city.  I know multiple
founders who would have preferred to live down in the Valley proper,
but who made themselves move to SF because they knew otherwise
they'd lose the talent war.<br><br>So being a magnet for people in their twenties is a very promising
thing to be.  It's hard to imagine a place becoming a startup hub
without also being that.  When I read that statistic about the
increasing percentage of 25 to 29 year olds, I had exactly the same
feeling of excitement I get when I see a startup's graphs start to
creep upward off the x axis.<br><br>Nationally the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds is 6.8%.  That means
you're .8% ahead.  The population is 306,000, so we're talking about
a surplus of about 2500 people.  That's the population of a small
town, and that's just the surplus. So you have a toehold.  Now you
just have to expand it.<br><br>And though "youth-driven food boom" may sound frivolous, it is
anything but.  Restaurants and cafes are a big part of the personality
of a city.  Imagine walking down a street in Paris. What are you
walking past?  Little restaurants and cafes.  Imagine driving through
some depressing random exurb.  What are you driving past?  Starbucks
and McDonalds and Pizza Hut.   As Gertrude Stein said, there is no
there there. You could be anywhere.<br><br>These independent restaurants and cafes are not just feeding people.
They're making there be a there here.<br><br>So here is my first concrete recommendation for turning Pittsburgh
into the next Silicon Valley: do everything you can to encourage
this youth-driven food boom.  What could the city do?  Treat the
people starting these little restaurants and cafes as your users,
and go ask them what they want.  I can guess at least one thing
they might want: a fast permit process.  San Francisco has left you
a huge amount of room to beat them in that department.<br><br>I know restaurants aren't the prime mover though.  The prime mover,
as the Times article said, is cheap housing.  That's a big advantage.
But that phrase "cheap housing" is a bit misleading.  There are
plenty of places that are cheaper.  What's special about Pittsburgh
is not that it's cheap, but that it's a cheap place you'd actually
want to live.<br><br>Part of that is the buildings themselves. I realized a long time
ago, back when I was a poor twenty-something myself, that the best
deals were places that had once been rich, and then became poor.
If a place has always been rich, it's nice but too expensive.  If
a place has always been poor, it's cheap but grim.  But if a place
was once rich and then got poor, you can find palaces for cheap.
And that's what's bringing people here.  When Pittsburgh was rich,
a hundred years ago, the people who lived here built big solid
buildings.  Not always in the best taste, but definitely solid.  So
here is another piece of advice for becoming a startup hub: don't
destroy the buildings that are bringing people here.  When cities
are on the way back up, like Pittsburgh is now, developers race to
tear down the old buildings.  Don't let that happen.  Focus on
historic preservation.  Big real estate development projects are
not what's bringing the twenty-somethings here.  They're the opposite
of the new restaurants and cafes; they subtract personality from
the city.<br><br>The empirical evidence suggests you cannot be too strict about
historic preservation.  The tougher cities are about it, the better
they seem to do.<br><br>But the appeal of Pittsburgh is not just the buildings themselves.
It's the neighborhoods they're in. Like San Francisco and New York,
Pittsburgh is fortunate in being a pre-car city.  It's not too
spread out. Because those 25 to 29 year olds do not like driving.
They prefer walking, or bicycling, or taking public transport.  If
you've been to San Francisco recently you can't help noticing the
huge number of bicyclists.  And this is not just a fad that the
twenty-somethings have adopted.  In this respect they have discovered
a better way to live.  The beards will go, but not the bikes.  Cities
where you can get around without driving are just better period.
So I would suggest you do everything you can to capitalize on this.
As with historic preservation, it seems impossible to go too far.<br><br>Why not make Pittsburgh the most bicycle and pedestrian friendly
city in the country?  See if you can go so far that you make San
Francisco seem backward by comparison.  If you do, it's very unlikely
you'll regret it.  The city will seem like a paradise to the young
people you want to attract.  If they do leave to get jobs elsewhere,
it will be with regret at leaving behind such a place.  And what's
the downside?  Can you imagine a headline "City ruined by becoming
too bicycle-friendly?"  It just doesn't happen.<br><br>So suppose cool old neighborhoods and cool little restaurants make
this the next Portland.  Will that be enough?  It will put you in
a way better position than Portland itself, because Pittsburgh has
something Portland lacks: a first-rate research university.  CMU
plus little cafes means you have more than hipsters drinking lattes.
It means you have hipsters drinking lattes while talking about
distributed systems.  Now you're getting really close to San
Francisco.<br><br>In fact you're better off than San Francisco in one way, because
CMU is downtown, but Stanford and Berkeley are out in the suburbs.<br><br>What can CMU do to help Pittsburgh become a startup hub?  Be an
even better research university.  CMU is one of the best universities
in the world, but imagine what things would be like if it were the
very best, and everyone knew it.  There are a lot of ambitious
people who must go to the best place, wherever it is.  If CMU were it, they would all come here. There would be
kids in Kazakhstan dreaming of one day living in Pittsburgh.<br><br>Being that kind of talent magnet is the most important contribution
universities can make toward making their city a startup hub.  In
fact it is practically the only contribution they can make.<br><br>But wait, shouldn't universities be setting up programs with words
like "innovation" and "entrepreneurship" in their names?  No, they
should not.  These kind of things almost always turn out to be
disappointments.  They're pursuing the wrong targets.  The way to
get innovation is not to aim for innovation but to aim for something
more specific, like better batteries or better 3D printing.  And
the way to learn about entrepreneurship is to do it, which you 
<a href="before.html"><u>can't
in school</u></a>.<br><br>I know it may disappoint some administrators to hear that the best
thing a university can do to encourage startups is to be a great
university.  It's like telling people who want to lose weight that
the way to do it is to eat less.<br><br>But if you want to know where startups come from, look at the
empirical evidence.  Look at the histories of the most successful
startups, and you'll find they grow organically out of a couple of
founders building something that starts as an interesting side
project.  Universities are great at bringing together founders, but
beyond that the best thing they can do is get out of the way.  For
example, by not claiming ownership of "intellectual property" that
students and faculty develop, and by having liberal rules about
deferred admission and leaves of absence.<br><br>In fact, one of the most effective things a university could do to
encourage startups is an elaborate form of getting out of the way
invented by Harvard.  Harvard used to have exams for the fall
semester after Christmas.  At the beginning of January they had
something called "Reading Period" when you were supposed to be
studying for exams.  And Microsoft and Facebook have something in
common that few people realize: they were both started during Reading
Period.  It's the perfect situation for producing the sort of side
projects that turn into startups. The students are all on campus,
but they don't have to do anything because they're supposed to be
studying for exams.<br><br>Harvard may have closed this window, because a few years ago they
moved exams before Christmas and shortened reading period from 11
days to 7.  But if a university really wanted to help its students
start startups, the empirical evidence, weighted by market cap,
suggests the best thing they can do is literally nothing.<br><br>The culture of Pittsburgh is another of its strengths.  It seems
like a city has to be socially liberal to be a startup hub,
and it's pretty clear why. A city has to tolerate strangeness to
be a home for startups, because startups are so strange.  And you
can't choose to allow just the forms of strangeness that will turn
into big startups, because they're all intermingled.  You have to
tolerate all strangeness.<br><br>That immediately rules out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/us/gay-rights-mississippi-north-carolina.html"><u>big chunks of the US</u></a>.  I'm optimistic
it doesn't rule out Pittsburgh.  One of the things I remember from
growing up here, though I didn't realize at the time that there was
anything unusual about it, is how well people got along.  I'm still
not sure why.  Maybe one reason was that everyone felt like an
immigrant.  When I was a kid in Monroeville, people didn't call
themselves American.  They called themselves Italian or Serbian or
Ukranian.  Just imagine what it must have been like here a hundred
years ago, when people were pouring in from twenty different
countries.  Tolerance was the only option.<br><br>What I remember about the culture of Pittsburgh is that it was
both tolerant and pragmatic.  That's how I'd describe the culture
of Silicon Valley too.  And it's not a coincidence, because Pittsburgh
was the Silicon Valley of its time.  This was a city where people
built new things.  And while the things people build have changed,
the spirit you need to do that kind of work is the same.<br><br>So although an influx of latte-swilling hipsters may be annoying
in some ways, I would go out of my way to encourage them.  And more
generally to tolerate strangeness, even unto the degree wacko
Californians do.  For Pittsburgh that is a conservative choice:
it's a return to the city's roots.<br><br>Unfortunately I saved the toughest part for last. There is one more
thing you need to be a startup hub, and Pittsburgh hasn't got it:
investors.  Silicon Valley has a big investor community because
it's had 50 years to grow one.  New York has a big investor community
because it's full of people who like money a lot and are quick to
notice new ways to get it.  But Pittsburgh has neither of these.
And the cheap housing that draws other people here has no effect
on investors.<br><br>If an investor community grows up here, it will happen the same way
it did in Silicon Valley: slowly and organically.  So I would not
bet on having a big investor community in the short term.  But
fortunately there are three trends that make that less necessary
than it used to be.  One is that startups are increasingly cheap
to start, so you just don't need as much outside money as you used
to.  The second is that thanks to things like Kickstarter, a startup
can get to revenue faster.  You can put something on Kickstarter
from anywhere.  The third is programs like Y Combinator.  A startup
from anywhere in the world can go to YC for 3 months, pick up
funding, and then return home if they want.<br><br>My advice is to make Pittsburgh a great place for startups, and
gradually more of them will stick.  Some of those will succeed;
some of their founders will become investors; and still more startups
will stick.<br><br>This is not a fast path to becoming a startup hub. But it is at
least a path, which is something few other cities have.  And it's
not as if you have to make painful sacrifices in the meantime.
Think about what I've suggested you should do.  Encourage local
restaurants, save old buildings, take advantage of density, make
CMU the best, promote tolerance.  These are the things that make
Pittsburgh good to live in now.  All I'm saying is that you should
do even more of them.<br><br>And that's an encouraging thought.  If Pittsburgh's path to becoming
a startup hub is to be even more itself, then it has a good chance
of succeeding.  In fact it probably has the best chance of any city
its size.  It will take some effort, and a lot of time, but if any
city can do it, Pittsburgh can.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Charlie Cheever and Jessica Livingston for reading

turned out. In Newton's day the three problems 
seemed roughly equally promising. No one knew yet
