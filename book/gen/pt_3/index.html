<p>
August 2013<br><br>When people hurt themselves lifting heavy things, it's usually
because they try to lift with their back.  The right way to lift
heavy things is to let your legs do the work.  Inexperienced founders
make the same mistake when trying to convince investors.  They try
to convince with their pitch.  Most would be better off if they let
their startup do the work — if they started by understanding why
their startup is worth investing in, then simply explained this
well to investors.<br><br>Investors are looking for startups that will be very successful.
But that test is not as simple as it sounds.  In startups, as in a
lot of other domains, the distribution of outcomes follows a power
law, but in startups the curve is startlingly steep.  The big
successes are so big they 
<a href="swan.html">dwarf</a> the rest.  And since there are only
a handful each year (the conventional wisdom is 15), investors treat
"big success" as if it were binary.  Most are interested in you if
you seem like you have a chance, however small, of being one of the
15 big successes, and otherwise not.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>(There are a handful of angels who'd be interested in a company
with a high probability of being moderately successful.  But angel
investors like big successes too.)<br><br>How do you seem like you'll be one of the big successes?  You need
three things: formidable founders, a promising market, and (usually)
some evidence of success so far.<br><br><b>Formidable</b><br><br>The most important ingredient is formidable founders.  Most investors
decide in the first few minutes whether you seem like a winner or
a loser, and once their opinion is set it's hard to change.&nbsp;<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Every startup has reasons both to invest and not to invest.  If
investors think you're a winner they focus on the former, and if
not they focus on the latter.  For example, it might be a rich
market, but with a slow sales cycle.  If investors are impressed
with you as founders, they say they want to invest because it's a
rich market, and if not, they say they can't invest because of the
slow sales cycle.<br><br>They're not necessarily trying to mislead you.  Most investors are
genuinely unclear in their own minds why they like or dislike
startups.  If you seem like a winner, they'll like your idea more.
But don't be too smug about this weakness of theirs, because you
have it too; almost everyone does.<br><br>There is a role for ideas of course.  They're fuel for the fire
that starts with liking the founders.  Once investors like you,
you'll see them reaching for ideas: they'll be saying "yes, and you
could also do x."  (Whereas when they don't like you, they'll be
saying "but what about y?")<br><br>But the foundation of convincing investors is to seem formidable,
and since this isn't a word most people use in conversation much,
I should explain what it means.  A formidable person is one who
seems like they'll get what they want, regardless of whatever
obstacles are in the way.  Formidable is close to confident, except
that someone could be confident and mistaken.  Formidable is roughly
justifiably confident.<br><br>There are a handful of people who are really good at seeming
formidable — some because they actually are very formidable and
just let it show, and others because they are more or less con
artists.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
But most founders, including many who will go on
to start very successful companies, are not that good at seeming
formidable the first time they try fundraising.  What should they
do?
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>What they should not do is try to imitate the swagger of more
experienced founders.  Investors are not always that good at judging
technology, but they're good at judging confidence.  If you try to
act like something you're not, you'll just end up in an uncanny
valley.  You'll depart from sincere, but never arrive at convincing.<br><br><b>Truth</b><br><br>The way to seem most formidable as an inexperienced founder is to
stick to the truth.   How formidable you seem isn't a constant.  It
varies depending on what you're saying.  Most people can seem
confident when they're saying "one plus one is two," because they
know it's true.  The most diffident person would be puzzled and
even slightly contemptuous if they told a VC "one plus one is two"
and the VC reacted with skepticism.  The magic ability of people
who are good at seeming formidable is that they can do this with
the sentence "we're going to make a billion dollars a year."  But
you can do the same, if not with that sentence with some fairly
impressive ones, so long as you convince yourself first.<br><br>That's the secret.  Convince yourself that your startup is worth
investing in, and then when you explain this to investors they'll
believe you.  And by convince yourself, I don't mean play mind games
with yourself to boost your confidence.  I mean truly evaluate
whether your startup is worth investing in.  If it isn't, don't try
to raise money.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
But if it is, you'll be telling the truth
when you tell investors it's worth investing in, and they'll sense
that.  You don't have to be a smooth presenter if you understand
something well and tell the truth about it.<br><br>To evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in, you have
to be a domain expert.  If you're not a domain expert, you can be
as convinced as you like about your idea, and it will seem to
investors no more than an instance of the Dunning-Kruger effect.
Which in fact it will usually be.  And investors can tell fairly
quickly whether you're a domain expert by how well you answer their
questions.  Know everything about your market.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Why do founders persist in trying to convince investors of things
they're not convinced of themselves?  Partly because we've all been
trained to.<br><br>When my friends Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell were in grad
school, one of their fellow students was on the receiving end of a
question from their faculty advisor that we still quote today.  When
the unfortunate fellow got to his last slide, the professor burst
out:
</p><blockquote>
  Which one of these conclusions do you actually believe?
</blockquote>
One of the artifacts of the way schools are organized is that we
all get trained to talk even when we have nothing to say.  If you
have a ten page paper due, then ten pages you must write, even if
you only have one page of ideas.  Even if you have no ideas.  You
have to produce something.  And all too many startups go into
fundraising in the same spirit.  When they think it's time to raise
money, they try gamely to make the best case they can for their
startup.  Most never think of pausing beforehand to ask whether
what they're saying is actually convincing, because they've all
been trained to treat the need to present as a given — as an area
of fixed size, over which however much truth they have must needs
be spread, however thinly.<br><br>The time to raise money is not when you need it, or when you reach
some artificial deadline like a Demo Day.  It's when you can convince
investors, and not before. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>And unless you're a good con artist, you'll never convince investors
if you're not convinced yourself.  They're far better at detecting
bullshit than you are at producing it, even if you're producing it
unknowingly.  If you try to convince investors before you've convinced
yourself, you'll be wasting both your time.<br><br>But pausing first to convince yourself will do more than save you
from wasting your time.  It will force you to organize your thoughts.
To convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, you'll
have to figure out why it's worth investing in.   And if you can
do that you'll end up with more than added confidence.  You'll also
have a provisional roadmap of how to succeed.<br><br><b>Market</b><br><br>Notice I've been careful to talk about whether a startup is worth
investing in, rather than whether it's going to succeed.  No one
knows whether a startup is going to succeed.  And it's a good thing
for investors that this is so, because if you could know in advance
whether a startup would succeed, the stock price would already be
the future price, and there would be no room for investors to make
money.  Startup investors know that every investment is a bet, and
against pretty long odds.<br><br>So to prove you're worth investing in, you don't have to prove
you're going to succeed, just that you're a sufficiently good bet.
What makes a startup a sufficiently good bet?  In addition to
formidable founders, you need a plausible path to owning a big piece
of a big market.  Founders think of startups as ideas, but investors
think of them as markets.  If there are x number of customers who'd
pay an average of $y per year for what you're making, then the total
addressable market, or TAM, of your company is $xy.  Investors don't
expect you to collect all that money, but it's an upper bound on
how big you can get.<br><br>Your target market has to be big, and it also has to be capturable
by you.  But the market doesn't have to be big yet, nor do you
necessarily have to be in it yet.  Indeed, it's often better to
start in a <a href="ds.html">small</a> market that will either turn into a big one or
from which you can move into a big one.  There just has to be some
plausible sequence of hops that leads to dominating a big market a
few years down the line.<br><br>The standard of plausibility varies dramatically depending on the
age of the startup.  A three month old company at Demo Day only
needs to be a promising experiment that's worth funding to see how
it turns out.  Whereas a two year old company raising a series A
round needs to be able to show the experiment worked. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>But every company that gets really big is "lucky" in the sense that
their growth is due mostly to some external wave they're riding,
so to make a convincing case for becoming huge, you have to identify
some specific trend you'll benefit from.  Usually you can find this
by asking "why now?"  If this is such a great idea, why hasn't
someone else already done it?  Ideally the answer is that it only
recently became a good idea, because something changed, and no one
else has noticed yet.<br><br>Microsoft for example was not going to grow huge selling Basic
interpreters.  But by starting there they were perfectly poised to
expand up the stack of microcomputer software as microcomputers
grew powerful enough to support one. And microcomputers turned out
to be a really huge wave, bigger than even the most optimistic
observers would have predicted in 1975.<br><br>But while Microsoft did really well and there is thus a temptation
to think they would have seemed a great bet a few months in, they
probably didn't.  Good, but not great.  No company, however successful,
ever looks more than a pretty good bet a few months in. Microcomputers
turned out to be a big deal, and Microsoft both executed well and
got lucky.  But it was by no means obvious that this was how things
would play out.  Plenty of companies seem as good a bet a few months
in.  I don't know about startups in general, but at least half the
startups we fund could make as good a case as Microsoft could have
for being on a path to dominating a large market.  And who can
reasonably expect more of a startup than that?<br><br><b>Rejection</b><br><br>If you can make as good a case as Microsoft could have, will you
convince investors?  Not always.  A lot of VCs would have rejected
Microsoft.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font>
Certainly some rejected Google.  And getting
rejected will put you in a slightly awkward position, because as
you'll see when you start fundraising, the most common question
you'll get from investors will be "who else is investing?" What do
you say if you've been fundraising for a while and no one has
committed yet? 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>The people who are really good at acting formidable often solve
this problem by giving investors the impression that while no
investors have committed yet, several are about to.  This is arguably
a permissible tactic.  It's slightly dickish of investors to care
more about who else is investing than any other aspect of your
startup, and misleading them about how far along you are with other
investors seems the complementary countermove.  It's arguably an
instance of scamming a scammer. But I don't recommend this approach
to most founders, because most founders wouldn't be able to carry
it off.  This is the single most common lie told to investors, and
you have to be really good at lying to tell members of some profession
the most common lie they're told.<br><br>If you're not a master of negotiation (and perhaps even if you are)
the best solution is to tackle the problem head-on, and to explain
why investors have turned you down and why they're mistaken.  If
you know you're on the right track, then you also know why investors
were wrong to reject you. Experienced investors are well aware that
the best ideas are also the scariest.  They all know about the VCs
who rejected Google.  If instead of seeming evasive and ashamed
about having been turned down (and thereby implicitly agreeing with
the verdict) you talk candidly about what scared investors about
you, you'll seem more confident, which they like, and you'll probably
also do a better job of presenting that aspect of your startup.  At
the very least, that worry will now be out in the open instead of
being a gotcha left to be discovered by the investors you're currently
talking to, who will be proud of and thus attached to their discovery.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>This strategy will work best with the best investors, who are both
hard to bluff and who already believe most other investors are
conventional-minded drones doomed always to miss the big outliers.
Raising money is not like applying to college, where you can assume
that if you can get into MIT, you can also get into Foobar State.
Because the best investors are much smarter than the rest, and the
best startup ideas look initially like 
<a href="startupideas.html">bad ideas</a>, it's not uncommon
for a startup to be rejected by all the VCs except the best ones.
That's what happened to Dropbox.  Y Combinator started in Boston,
and for the first 3 years we ran alternating batches in Boston and
Silicon Valley.  Because Boston investors were so few and so timid,
we used to ship Boston batches out for a second Demo Day in Silicon
Valley.  Dropbox was part of a Boston batch, which means all those
Boston investors got the first look at Dropbox, and none of them
closed the deal.  Yet another backup and syncing thing, they all
thought.  A couple weeks later, Dropbox raised a series A round
from Sequoia.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Different</b><br><br>Not understanding that investors view investments as bets combines
with the ten page paper mentality to prevent founders from even
considering the possibility of being certain of what they're saying.
They think they're trying to convince investors of something very
uncertain — that their startup will be huge — and convincing anyone
of something like that must obviously entail some wild feat of
salesmanship.  But in fact when you raise money you're trying to
convince investors of something so much less speculative — whether
the company has all the elements of a good bet — that you can
approach the problem in a qualitatively different way.  You can
convince yourself, then convince them.<br><br>And when you convince them, use the same matter-of-fact language
you used to convince yourself.  You wouldn't use vague, grandiose
marketing-speak among yourselves.  Don't use it with investors
either.  It not only doesn't work on them, but seems a mark of
incompetence.  Just be concise.  Many investors explicitly use that
as a test, reasoning (correctly) that if you can't explain your
plans concisely, you don't really understand them.  But even investors
who don't have a rule about this will be bored and frustrated by
unclear explanations.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>So here's the recipe for impressing investors when you're not already
good at seeming formidable:
<ol>
<li> Make something worth investing in.<br><br></li><li> Understand why it's worth investing in.<br><br></li><li> Explain that clearly to investors.
</li></ol>
If you're saying something you know is true, you'll seem confident
when you're saying it.  Conversely, never let pitching draw you
into bullshitting.  As long as you stay on the territory of truth,
you're strong.  Make the truth good, then just tell it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
There's no reason to believe this number is a constant.  In
fact it's our explicit goal at Y Combinator to increase it, by
encouraging people to start startups who otherwise wouldn't have.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Or more precisely, investors decide whether you're a loser
or possibly a winner.  If you seem like a winner, they may then,
depending on how much you're raising, have several more meetings
with you to test whether that initial impression holds up.<br><br>But if you seem like a loser they're done, at least for the next
year or so.  And when they decide you're a loser they usually decide
in way less than the 50 minutes they may have allotted for the first
meeting.  Which explains the astonished stories one always hears
about VC inattentiveness.  How could these people make investment
decisions well when they're checking their messages during startups'
presentations?  The solution to that mystery is that they've already
made the decision.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The two are not mutually exclusive.  There are people who are
both genuinely formidable, and also really good at acting that way.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
How can people who will go on to create giant companies not
seem formidable early on?  I think the main reason is that their
experience so far has trained them to keep their wings folded, as
it were.  Family, school, and jobs encourage cooperation, not
conquest.  And it's just as well they do, because even being Genghis
Khan is probably 99% cooperation.  But the result is that most
people emerge from the tube of their upbringing in their early
twenties compressed into the shape of the tube.  Some find they
have wings and start to spread them.  But this takes a few years.
In the beginning even they don't know yet what they're capable of.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
In fact, change what you're doing.  You're investing your own
time in your startup.  If you're not convinced that what you're
working on is a sufficiently good bet, why are you even working on
that?<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
When investors ask you a question you don't know the answer
to, the best response is neither to bluff nor give up, but instead
to explain how you'd figure out the answer.  If you can work out a
preliminary answer on the spot, so much the better, but explain
that's what you're doing.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
At YC we try to ensure startups are ready to raise money on
Demo Day by encouraging them to ignore investors and instead focus
on their companies till about a week before.  That way most reach
the stage where they're sufficiently convincing well before Demo
Day.  But not all do, so we also give any startup that wants to the
option of deferring to a later Demo Day.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Founders are often surprised by how much harder it is to raise
the next round.  There is a qualitative difference in investors'
attitudes.  It's like the difference between being judged as a kid
and as an adult.  The next time you raise money, it's not enough
to be promising.  You have to be delivering results.<br><br>So although it works well to show growth graphs at either stage,
investors treat them differently.  At three months, a growth graph
is mostly evidence that the founders are effective.  At two years,
it has to be evidence of a promising market and a company tuned to
exploit it.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
By this I mean that if the present day equivalent of the 3
month old Microsoft presented at a Demo Day, there would be investors
who turned them down.  Microsoft itself didn't raise outside money,
and indeed the venture business barely existed when they got started
in 1975.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
The best investors rarely care who else is investing, but
mediocre investors almost all do.  So you can use this question as
a test of investor quality.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
To use this technique, you'll have to find out why investors
who rejected you did so, or at least what they claim was the reason.
That may require asking, because investors don't always volunteer
a lot of detail.  Make it clear when you ask that you're not trying
to dispute their decision — just that if there is some weakness in
your plans, you need to know about it.  You won't always get a real
reason out of them, but you should at least try.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]

Alfred Lin points out that it's doubly important for the
explanation of a startup to be clear and concise, because it has
to convince at one remove: it has to work not just on the partner
you talk to, but when that partner re-tells it to colleagues.<br><br>We consciously optimize for this at YC.  When we work with founders
create a Demo Day pitch, the last step is to imagine how an investor
would sell it to colleagues.<br><br>

August 2013<br><br>The biggest component in most investors' opinion of you is the
opinion of other investors.  Which is of course a recipe for
exponential growth.  When one investor wants to invest in you, that
makes other investors want to, which makes others want to, and so
on.<br><br>Sometimes inexperienced founders mistakenly conclude that manipulating
these forces is the essence of fundraising.  They hear stories about
stampedes to invest in successful startups, and think it's therefore
the mark of a successful startup to have this happen.  But actually
the two are not that highly correlated.  Lots of startups that cause
stampedes end up flaming out (in extreme cases, partly as a result
of the stampede), and lots of very successful startups were only
moderately popular with investors the first time they raised money.<br><br>So the point of this essay is not to explain how to create a stampede,
but merely to explain the forces that generate them.  These forces
are always at work to some degree in fundraising, and they can cause
surprising situations.  If you understand them, you can at least
avoid being surprised.<br><br>One reason investors like you more when other investors like you
is that you actually become a better investment.  Raising money
decreases the risk of failure.  Indeed, although investors hate it,
you are for this reason justified in raising your valuation for
later investors.  The investors who invested when you had no money
were taking more risk, and are entitled to higher returns.  Plus a
company that has raised money is literally more valuable.  After
you raise the first million dollars, the company is at least a
million dollars more valuable, because it's the same company as
before, plus it has a million dollars in the bank.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Beware, though, because later investors so hate to have the price
raised on them that they resist even this self-evident reasoning.
Only raise the price on an investor you're comfortable with losing,
because some will angrily refuse.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The second reason investors like you more when you've had some
success at fundraising is that it makes you more confident, and an
investors' opinion of <a href="convince.html">you</a> is the foundation
of their opinion of your company.  Founders are often surprised how
quickly investors seem to know when they start to succeed at raising
money.  And while there are in fact lots of ways for such information
to spread among investors, the main vector is probably the founders
themselves.  Though they're often clueless about technology, most
investors are pretty good at reading people.  When fundraising is
going well, investors are quick to sense it in your increased
confidence.  (This is one case where the average founder's inability
to remain poker-faced works to your advantage.)<br><br>But frankly the most important reason investors like you more when
you've started to raise money is that they're bad at judging startups.
Judging startups is hard even for the best investors.  The mediocre
ones might as well be flipping coins.  So when mediocre investors
see that lots of other people want to invest in you, they assume
there must be a reason.  This leads to the phenomenon known in the
Valley as the "hot deal," where you have more interest from investors
than you can handle.<br><br>The best investors aren't influenced much by the opinion of other
investors.  It would only dilute their own judgment to average it
together with other people's.  But they are indirectly influenced
in the practical sense that interest from other investors imposes
a deadline.  This is the fourth way in which offers beget offers.
If you start to get far along the track toward an offer with one
firm, it will sometimes provoke other firms, even good ones, to
make up their minds, lest they lose the deal.<br><br>Unless you're a wizard at negotiation (and if you're not sure,
you're not) be very careful about exaggerating this to push a good
investor to decide.  Founders try this sort of thing all the time,
and investors are very sensitive to it.  If anything oversensitive.
But you're safe so long as you're telling the truth.  If you're
getting far along with investor B, but you'd rather raise money
from investor A, you can tell investor A that this is happening.
There's no manipulation in that.  You're genuinely in a bind, because
you really would rather raise money from A, but you can't safely
reject an offer from B when it's still uncertain what A will decide.<br><br>Do not, however, tell A who B is.  VCs will sometimes ask which
other VCs you're talking to, but you should never tell them.  Angels
you can sometimes tell about other angels, because angels cooperate
more with one another. But if VCs ask, just point out that they
wouldn't want you telling other firms about your conversations, and
you feel obliged to do the same for any firm you talk to.  If they
push you, point out that you're inexperienced at fundraising — which
is always a safe card to play — and you feel you have to be
extra cautious. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>While few startups will experience a stampede of interest, almost
all will at least initially experience the other side of this
phenomenon, where the herd remains clumped together at a distance.
The fact that investors are so much influenced by other investors'
opinions means you always start out in something of a hole.  So
don't be demoralized by how hard it is to get the first commitment,
because much of the difficulty comes from this external force.  The
second will be easier.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
An accountant might say that a company that has raised a million
dollars is no richer if it's convertible debt, but in practice money
raised as convertible debt is little different from money raised
in an equity round.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Founders are often surprised by this, but investors can get
very emotional.  Or rather indignant; that's the main emotion I've
observed; but it is very common, to the point where it sometimes
causes investors to act against their own interests.  I know of one
investor who invested in a startup at a $15 million valuation cap.
Earlier he'd had an opportunity to invest at a $5 million cap, but
he refused because a friend who invested earlier had been able to
invest at a $3 million cap.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
If an investor pushes you hard to tell them about your conversations
with other investors, is this someone you want as an investor?<br><br>

<p>
September 2013<br><br>Most startups that raise money do it more than once.  A typical
trajectory might be (1) to get started with a few tens of thousands
from something like Y Combinator or individual angels, then 
(2) raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company,
and then (3) once the company is clearly succeeding, raise one or
more later rounds to accelerate growth.<br><br>Reality can be messier.  Some companies raise money twice in phase
2.  Others skip phase 1 and go straight to phase 2.  And at Y&nbsp;Combinator 
we get an increasing number of companies that have already
raised amounts in the hundreds of thousands.  But the three phase
path is at least the one about which individual startups' paths
oscillate.<br><br>This essay focuses on phase 2 fundraising.  That's the type the
startups we fund are doing on Demo Day, and this essay is the advice
we give them.<br><br>
<b>Forces</b><br><br>Fundraising is hard in both senses: hard like lifting a heavy weight,
and hard like solving a puzzle.  It's hard like lifting a weight
because it's intrinsically hard to convince people to part with
large sums of money.  That problem is irreducible; it should be
hard.  But much of the other kind of difficulty can be eliminated.
Fundraising only seems a puzzle because it's an alien world to most
founders, and I hope to fix that by supplying a map through it.<br><br>To founders, the behavior of investors is often opaque — partly
because their motivations are obscure, but partly because they
deliberately mislead you.  And the misleading ways of investors
combine horribly with the wishful thinking of inexperienced founders.
At YC we're always warning founders about this danger, and investors
are probably more circumspect with YC startups than with other
companies they talk to, and even so we witness a constant series
of explosions as these two volatile components combine.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you're an inexperienced founder, the only way to survive is by
imposing external constraints on yourself.  You can't trust your
intuitions.  I'm going to give you a set of rules here that will
get you through this process if anything will.  At certain moments
you'll be tempted to ignore them.  So rule number zero is: these
rules exist for a reason.  You wouldn't need a rule to keep you
going in one direction if there weren't powerful forces pushing you
in another.<br><br>The ultimate source of the forces acting on you are the forces
acting on investors.  Investors are pinched between two kinds of
fear: fear of investing in startups that fizzle, and fear of missing
out on startups that take off.  The cause of all this fear is the
very thing that makes startups such attractive investments: the
successful ones grow very fast.  But that fast growth means investors
can't wait around.  If you wait till a startup is obviously a
success, it's too late.  To get the really high returns, you have
to invest in startups when it's still unclear how they'll do.  But
that in turn makes investors nervous they're about to invest in a
flop.  As indeed they often are.<br><br>What investors would like to do, if they could, is wait.  When a
startup is only a few months old, every week that passes gives you
significantly more information about them.  But if you wait too
long, other investors might take the deal away from you.  And of
course the other investors are all subject to the same forces.  So
what tends to happen is that they all wait as long as they can,
then when some act the rest have to.<br><br>
<b>Don't raise money unless you want it and it wants you.</b><br><br>Such a high proportion of successful startups raise money that it
might seem fundraising is one of the defining qualities of a startup.
Actually it isn't.  <a href="growth.html">Rapid growth</a> is what
makes a company a startup.  Most companies in a position to grow
rapidly find that (a) taking outside money helps them grow faster,
and (b) their growth potential makes it easy to attract such money.
It's so common for both (a) and (b) to be true of a successful
startup that practically all do raise outside money.  But there may
be cases where a startup either wouldn't want to grow faster, or
outside money wouldn't help them to, and if you're one of them,
don't raise money.<br><br>The other time not to raise money is when you won't be able to.  If
you try to raise money before you can <a href="convince.html">convince</a>
investors, you'll not only waste your time, but also burn your
reputation with those investors.<br><br>
<b>Be in fundraising mode or not.</b><br><br>One of the things that surprises founders most about fundraising
is how distracting it is.  When you start fundraising, everything
else grinds to a halt.  The problem is not the time fundraising
consumes but that it becomes the <a href="top.html">top idea in
your mind</a>.  A startup can't endure that level of distraction
for long.  An early stage startup grows mostly because the founders
<a href="ds.html">make</a> it grow, and if the founders look away,
growth usually drops sharply.<br><br>Because fundraising is so distracting, a startup should either be
in fundraising mode or not.  And when you do decide to raise money,
you should focus your whole attention on it so you can get it done
quickly and get back to work.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>You can take money from investors when you're not in fundraising
mode.  You just can't expend any attention on it.  There are two
things that take attention: convincing investors, and negotiating
with them.  So when you're not in fundraising mode, you should take
money from investors only if they require no convincing, and are
willing to invest on terms you'll take without negotiation.  For
example, if a reputable investor is willing to invest on a convertible
note, using standard paperwork, that is either uncapped or capped
at a good valuation, you can take that without having to think.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
The terms will be whatever they turn out to be in your next
equity round.  And "no convincing" means just that: zero time spent
meeting with investors or preparing materials for them.  If an
investor says they're ready to invest, but they need you to come
in for one meeting to meet some of the partners, tell them no, if
you're not in fundraising mode, because that's fundraising. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font>
Tell them politely; tell them you're focusing on the company right
now, and that you'll get back to them when you're fundraising; but
do not get sucked down the slippery slope.<br><br>Investors will try to lure you into fundraising when you're not.
It's great for them if they can, because they can thereby get a
shot at you before everyone else.  They'll send you emails saying
they want to meet to learn more about you.  If you get cold-emailed
by an associate at a VC firm, you shouldn't meet even if you are
in fundraising mode.  Deals don't happen that way.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
But even
if you get an email from a partner you should try to delay meeting
till you're in fundraising mode.  They may say they just want to
meet and chat, but investors never just want to meet and chat.  What
if they like you?  What if they start to talk about giving you
money?  Will you be able to resist having that conversation?  Unless
you're experienced enough at fundraising to have a casual conversation
with investors that stays casual, it's safer to tell them that you'd
be happy to later, when you're fundraising, but that right now you
need to focus on the company.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Companies that are successful at raising money in phase 2 sometimes
tack on a few investors after leaving fundraising mode.  This is
fine; if fundraising went well, you'll be able to do it without
spending time convincing them or negotiating about terms.<br><br>
<b>Get introductions to investors.</b><br><br>Before you can talk to investors, you have to be introduced to them.
If you're presenting at a Demo Day, you'll be introduced to a whole
bunch simultaneously.  But even if you are, you should supplement
these with intros you collect yourself.<br><br>Do you have to be introduced?  In phase 2, yes.  Some investors
will let you email them a business plan, but you can tell from the
way their sites are organized that they don't really want startups
to approach them directly.<br><br>Intros vary greatly in effectiveness.  The best type of intro is
from a well-known investor who has just invested in you.  So when
you get an investor to commit, ask them to introduce you to other
investors they respect.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
The next best type of intro is from a
founder of a company they've funded.  You can also get intros from
other people in the startup community, like lawyers and reporters.<br><br>There are now sites like AngelList, FundersClub, and WeFunder that
can introduce you to investors.  We recommend startups treat them
as auxiliary sources of money.  Raise money first from leads you
get yourself.  Those will on average be better investors.  Plus
you'll have an easier time raising money on these sites once you
can say you've already raised some from well-known investors.<br><br>
<b>Hear no till you hear yes.</b><br><br>Treat investors as saying no till they unequivocally say yes, in
the form of a definite offer with no contingencies.<br><br>I mentioned earlier that investors prefer to wait if they can.
What's particularly dangerous for founders is the way they wait.
Essentially, they lead you on.  They seem like they're about to
invest right up till the moment they say no.  If they even say no.
Some of the worse ones never actually do say no; they just stop
replying to your emails.  They hope that way to get a free option
on investing.  If they decide later that they want to invest — usually
because they've heard you're a hot deal — they can pretend they
just got distracted and then restart the conversation as if they'd
been about to.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>That's not the worst thing investors will do.  Some will use language
that makes it sound as if they're committing, but which doesn't
actually commit them.  And wishful thinking founders are happy to
meet them half way.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>Fortunately, the next rule is a tactic for neutralizing this behavior.
But to work it depends on you not being tricked by the no that
sounds like yes.  It's so common for founders to be misled/mistaken
about this that we designed a <a href="http://ycombinator.com/hdp.html">protocol</a> to fix the
problem.  If you believe an investor has committed, get them to
confirm it.  If you and they have different views of reality, whether
the source of the discrepancy is their sketchiness or your wishful
thinking, the prospect of confirming a commitment in writing will
flush it out.  And till they confirm, regard them as saying no.<br><br>
<b>Do breadth-first search weighted by expected value.</b><br><br>When you talk to investors your m.o. should be breadth-first search,
weighted by expected value.  You should always talk to investors
in parallel rather than serially.  You can't afford the time it
takes to talk to investors serially, plus if you only talk to one
investor at a time, they don't have the pressure of other investors
to make them act.  But you shouldn't pay the same attention to every
investor, because some are more promising prospects than others.
The optimal solution is to talk to all potential investors in
parallel, but give higher priority to the more promising ones. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>Expected value = how likely an investor is to say yes, multiplied
by how good it would be if they did.  So for example, an eminent
investor who would invest a lot, but will be hard to convince, might
have the same expected value as an obscure angel who won't invest
much, but will be easy to convince.  Whereas an obscure angel who
will only invest a small amount, and yet needs to meet multiple
times before making up his mind, has very low expected value.  Meet
such investors last, if at all. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>Doing breadth-first search weighted by expected value will save you
from investors who never explicitly say no but merely drift away,
because you'll drift away from them at the same rate.  It protects
you from investors who flake in much the same way that a distributed
algorithm protects you from processors that fail.  If some investor
isn't returning your emails, or wants to have lots of meetings but
isn't progressing toward making you an offer, you automatically
focus less on them.  But you have to be disciplined about assigning
probabilities.  You can't let how much you want an investor influence
your estimate of how much they want you.<br><br>
<b>Know where you stand.</b><br><br>How do you judge how well you're doing with an investor, when
investors habitually seem more positive than they are?  By looking
at their actions rather than their words.  Every investor has some
track they need to move along from the first conversation to wiring
the money, and you should always know what that track consists of,
where you are on it, and how fast you're moving forward.<br><br>Never leave a meeting with an investor without asking what happens
next.  What more do they need in order to decide?  Do they need
another meeting with you?  To talk about what?  And how soon?  Do
they need to do something internally, like talk to their partners,
or investigate some issue?  How long do they expect it to take?
Don't be too pushy, but know where you stand.  If investors are
vague or resist answering such questions, assume the worst; investors
who are seriously interested in you will usually be happy to talk
about what has to happen between now and wiring the money, because
they're already running through that in their heads. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you're experienced at negotiations, you already know how to ask
such questions.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font>
If you're not, there's a trick you can use
in this situation.  Investors know you're inexperienced at raising
money.  Inexperience there doesn't make you unattractive.  Being a
noob at technology would, if you're starting a technology startup,
but not being a noob at fundraising.  Larry and Sergey were noobs
at fundraising.  So you can just confess that you're inexperienced
at this and ask how their process works and where you are in it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#999999">14</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Get the first commitment.</b><br><br>The biggest factor in most investors' opinions of you is the opinion
of <a href="herd.html">other investors</a>.  Once you start getting
investors to commit, it becomes increasingly easy to get more to.
But the other side of this coin is that it's often hard to get the
first commitment.<br><br>Getting the first substantial offer can be half the total difficulty
of fundraising.  What counts as a substantial offer depends on who
it's from and how much it is.  Money from friends and family doesn't
usually count, no matter how much.  But if you get $50k from a well
known VC firm or angel investor, that will usually be enough to set
things rolling.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#999999">15</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Close committed money.</b><br><br>It's not a deal till the money's in the bank.  I often hear
inexperienced founders say things like "We've raised $800,000,"
only to discover that zero of it is in the bank so far.  Remember
the twin fears that torment investors?  The fear of missing out
that makes them jump early, and the fear of jumping onto a turd
that results?  This is a market where people are exceptionally prone
to buyer's remorse.  And it's also one that furnishes them plenty
of excuses to gratify it.  The public markets snap startup investing
around like a whip.  If the Chinese economy blows up tomorrow, all
bets are off.  But there are lots of surprises for individual
startups too, and they tend to be concentrated around fundraising.
Tomorrow a big competitor could appear, or you could get C&amp;Ded, or
your cofounder could quit.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#999999">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>Even a day's delay can bring news that causes an investor to change
their mind.  So when someone commits, get the money.  Knowing where
you stand doesn't end when they say they'll invest.  After they say
yes, know what the timetable is for getting the money, and then
babysit that process till it happens.  Institutional investors have
people in charge of wiring money, but you may have to hunt angels
down in person to collect a check.<br><br>Inexperienced investors are the ones most likely to get buyer's
remorse.  Established ones have learned to treat saying yes as like
diving off a diving board, and they also have more brand to preserve.
But I've heard of cases of even top-tier VC firms welching on deals.<br><br>
<b>Avoid investors who don't "lead."</b><br><br>Since getting the first offer is most of the difficulty of fundraising,
that should be part of your calculation of expected value when you
start.  You have to estimate not just the probability that an
investor will say yes, but the probability that they'd be the <i>first</i>
to say yes, and the latter is not simply a constant fraction of the
former.  Some investors are known for deciding quickly, and those
are extra valuable early on.<br><br>Conversely, an investor who will only invest once other investors
have is worthless initially.  And while most investors are influenced
by how interested other investors are in you, there are some who
have an explicit policy of only investing after other investors
have.  You can recognize this contemptible subspecies of investor
because they often talk about "leads."  They say that they don't
lead, or that they'll invest once you have a lead.  Sometimes they
even claim to be willing to lead themselves, by which they mean
they won't invest till you get $x from other investors.  (It's great
if by "lead" they mean they'll invest unilaterally, and in addition
will help you raise more.  What's lame is when they use the term
to mean they won't invest unless you can raise more elsewhere.)
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f17n"><font color="#999999">17</font></a>]</font><br><br>Where does this term "lead" come from?  Up till a few years ago,
startups raising money in phase 2 would usually raise equity rounds
in which several investors invested at the same time using the same
paperwork.  You'd negotiate the terms with one "lead" investor, and
then all the others would sign the same documents and all the money
change hands at the closing.<br><br>Series A rounds still work that way, but things now work differently
for most fundraising prior to the series A.  Now there are rarely
actual rounds before the A round, or leads for them.  Now startups
simply raise money from investors one at a time till they feel they
have enough.<br><br>Since there are no longer leads, why do investors use that term?
Because it's a more legitimate-sounding way of saying what they
really mean.  All they really mean is that their interest in you
is a function of other investors' interest in you.  I.e. the spectral
signature of all mediocre investors.  But when phrased in terms of
leads, it sounds like there is something structural and therefore
legitimate about their behavior.<br><br>When an investor tells you "I want to invest in you, but I don't
lead," translate that in your mind to "No, except yes if you turn
out to be a hot deal."  And since that's the default opinion of any
investor about any startup, they've essentially just told you
nothing.<br><br>When you first start fundraising, the expected value of an investor
who won't "lead" is zero, so talk to such investors last if at all.<br><br>
<b>Have multiple plans.</b><br><br>Many investors will ask how much you're planning to raise. This
question makes founders feel they should be planning to raise a
specific amount.  But in fact you shouldn't.  It's a mistake to
have fixed plans in an undertaking as unpredictable as fundraising.<br><br>So why do investors ask how much you plan to raise?  For much the
same reasons a salesperson in a store will ask "How much were you
planning to spend?" if you walk in looking for a gift for a friend.
You probably didn't have a precise amount in mind; you just want
to find something good, and if it's inexpensive, so much the better.
The salesperson asks you this not because you're supposed to have
a plan to spend a specific amount, but so they can show you only
things that cost the most you'll pay.<br><br>Similarly, when investors ask how much you plan to raise, it's not
because you're supposed to have a plan.  It's to see whether you'd
be a suitable recipient for the size of investment they like to
make, and also to judge your ambition, reasonableness, and how far
you are along with fundraising.<br><br>If you're a wizard at fundraising, you can say "We plan to raise
a $7 million series A round, and we'll be accepting termsheets next
tuesday."  I've known a handful of founders who could pull that off
without having VCs laugh in their faces.  But if you're in the
inexperienced but earnest majority, the solution is analogous to
the solution I recommend for <a href="convince.html">pitching</a>
your startup: do the right thing and then just tell investors what
you're doing.<br><br>And the right strategy, in fundraising, is to have multiple plans
depending on how much you can raise.  Ideally you should be able
to tell investors something like: we can make it to profitability
without raising any more money, but if we raise a few hundred
thousand we can hire one or two smart friends, and if we raise a
couple million, we can hire a whole engineering team, etc.<br><br>Different plans match different investors.  If you're talking to a
VC firm that only does series A rounds (though there are few of
those left), it would be a waste of time talking about any but your
most expensive plan.  Whereas if you're talking to an angel who
invests $20k at a time and you haven't raised any money yet, you
probably want to focus on your least expensive plan.<br><br>If you're so fortunate as to have to think about the upper limit
on what you should raise, a good rule of thumb is to multiply the
number of people you want to hire times $15k times 18 months.  In
most startups, nearly all the costs are a function of the number
of people, and $15k per month is the conventional total cost
(including benefits and even office space) per person.  $15k per
month is high, so don't actually spend that much.  But it's ok to
use a high estimate when fundraising to add a margin for error.  If
you have additional expenses, like manufacturing, add in those at
the end.  Assuming you have none and you think you might hire 20
people, the most you'd want to raise is 20 x $15k x 18 = $5.4
million.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f18n"><font color="#999999">18</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Underestimate how much you want.</b><br><br>Though you can focus on different plans when talking to different
types of investors, you should on the whole err on the side of
underestimating the amount you hope to raise.<br><br>For example, if you'd like to raise $500k, it's better to say
initially that you're trying to raise $250k.  Then when you reach
$150k you're more than half done.  That sends two useful signals
to investors: that you're doing well, and that they have to decide
quickly because you're running out of room.  Whereas if you'd said
you were raising $500k, you'd be less than a third done at $150k.
If fundraising stalled there for an appreciable time, you'd start
to read as a failure.<br><br>Saying initially that you're raising $250k doesn't limit you to
raising that much.  When you reach your initial target and you still
have investor interest, you can just decide to raise more.  Startups
do that all the time.  In fact, most startups that are very successful
at fundraising end up raising more than they originally intended.<br><br>I'm not saying you should lie, but that you should lower your
expectations initially.  There is almost no downside in starting
with a low number.  It not only won't cap the amount you raise, but
will on the whole tend to increase it.<br><br>A good metaphor here is angle of attack.  If you try to fly at too
steep an angle of attack, you just stall.  If you say right out of
the gate that you want to raise a $5 million series A round, unless
you're in a very strong position, you not only won't get that but
won't get anything. Better to start at a low angle of attack, build
up speed, and then gradually increase the angle if you want.<br><br>
<b>Be profitable if you can.</b><br><br>You will be in a much stronger position if your collection of plans
includes one for raising zero dollars — i.e. if you can make
it to profitability without raising any additional money.  Ideally
you want to be able to say to investors "We'll succeed no matter
what, but raising money will help us do it faster."<br><br>There are many analogies between fundraising and dating, and this
is one of the strongest.  No one wants you if you seem desperate.
And the best way not to seem desperate is not to <i>be</i> desperate.
That's one reason we urge startups during YC to keep expenses low
and to try to make it to <a href="ramenprofitable.html">ramen
profitability</a> before Demo Day.  Though it sounds slightly
paradoxical, if you want to raise money, the best thing you can do
is get yourself to the point where you don't need to.<br><br>There are almost two distinct modes of fundraising: one in which
founders who need money knock on doors seeking it, knowing that
otherwise the company will die or at the very least people will
have to be fired, and one in which founders who don't need money
take some to grow faster than they could merely on their own revenues.
To emphasize the distinction I'm going to name them: type A fundraising
is when you don't need money, and type B fundraising is when you
do.<br><br>Inexperienced founders read about famous startups doing what was
type A fundraising, and decide they should raise money too, since
that seems to be how startups work. Except when they raise money
they don't have a clear path to profitability and are thus doing
type B fundraising.  And they are then surprised how difficult and
unpleasant it is.<br><br>Of course not all startups can make it to ramen profitability in a
few months.  And some that don't still manage to have the upper
hand over investors, if they have some other advantage like
extraordinary growth numbers or exceptionally formidable founders.
But as time passes it gets increasingly difficult to fundraise from
a position of strength without being profitable.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f19n"><font color="#999999">19</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Don't optimize for valuation.</b><br><br>When you raise money, what should your valuation be?  The most
important thing to understand about valuation is that it's not that
important.<br><br>Founders who raise money at high valuations tend to be unduly proud
of it.  Founders are often competitive people, and since valuation
is usually the only visible number attached to a startup, they end
up competing to raise money at the highest valuation.  This is
stupid, because fundraising is not the test that matters.  The real
test is revenue.  Fundraising is just a means to that end.  Being
proud of how well you did at fundraising is like being proud of
your college grades.<br><br>Not only is fundraising not the test that matters, valuation is not
even the thing to optimize about fundraising.  The number one thing
you want from phase 2 fundraising is to get the money you need, so
you can get back to focusing on the real test, the success of your
company.  Number two is good investors. Valuation is at best third.<br><br>The empirical evidence shows just how unimportant it is.  Dropbox
and Airbnb are the most successful companies we've funded so far,
and they raised money after Y Combinator at premoney valuations of
$4 million and $2.6 million respectively. Prices are so much higher
now that if you can raise money at all you'll probably raise it at
higher valuations than Dropbox and Airbnb.  So let that satisfy
your competitiveness.  You're doing better than Dropbox and Airbnb!
At a test that doesn't matter.<br><br>When you start fundraising, your initial valuation (or valuation
cap) will be set by the deal you make with the first investor who
commits.  You can increase the price for later investors, if you
get a lot of interest, but by default the valuation you got from
the first investor becomes your asking price.<br><br>So if you're raising money from multiple investors, as most companies
do in phase 2, you have to be careful to avoid raising the first
from an over-eager investor at a price you won't be able to
sustain.  You can of course lower your price if you need to (in
which case you should give the same terms to investors who invested
earlier at a higher price), but you may lose a bunch of leads in
the process of realizing you need to do this.<br><br>What you can do if you have eager first investors is raise money
from them on an uncapped convertible note with an MFN clause.  This
is essentially a way of saying that the valuation cap of the note
will be determined by the next investors you raise money from.<br><br>It will be easier to raise money at a lower valuation.  It shouldn't
be, but it is.  Since phase 2 prices vary at most 10x and the big
successes generate returns of at least 100x, investors should pick
startups entirely based on their estimate of the probability that
the company will be a big success and hardly at all on price.  But
although it's a mistake for investors to care about price, a
significant number do.  A startup that investors seem to like but
won't invest in at a cap of $x will have an easier time at $x/2.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f20n"><font color="#999999">20</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Yes/no before valuation.</b><br><br>Some investors want to know what your valuation is before they even
talk to you about investing.  If your valuation has already been
set by a prior investment at a specific valuation or cap, you can
tell them that number.  But if it isn't set because you haven't
closed anyone yet, and they try to push you to name a price, resist
doing so.  If this would be the first investor you've closed, then
this could be the tipping point of fundraising. That means closing
this investor is the first priority, and you need to get the
conversation onto that instead of being dragged sideways into a
discussion of price.<br><br>Fortunately there is a way to avoid naming a price in this situation.
And it is not just a negotiating trick; it's how you (both) should
be operating.  Tell them that valuation is not the most important
thing to you and that you haven't thought much about it, that you
are looking for investors you want to partner with and who want to
partner with you, and that you should talk first about whether they
want to invest at all.  Then if they decide they do want to invest,
you can figure out a price. But first things first.<br><br>Since valuation isn't that important and getting fundraising rolling
is, we usually tell founders to give the first investor who commits
as low a price as they need to.  This is a safe technique so long
as you combine it with the next one. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f21n"><font color="#999999">21</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Beware "valuation sensitive" investors.</b><br><br>Occasionally you'll encounter investors who describe themselves as
"valuation sensitive."  What this means in practice is that they
are compulsive negotiators who will suck up a lot of your time
trying to push your price down.  You should therefore never approach
such investors first. While you shouldn't chase high valuations,
you also don't want your valuation to be set artificially low because
the first investor who committed happened to be a compulsive
negotiator.  Some such investors have value, but the time to approach
them is near the end of fundraising, when you're in a position to
say "this is the price everyone else has paid; take it or leave it"
and not mind if they leave it.  This way, you'll not only get market
price, but it will also take less time.<br><br>Ideally you know which investors have a reputation for being
"valuation sensitive" and can postpone dealing with them till last,
but occasionally one you didn't know about will pop up early on.
The rule of doing breadth first search weighted by expected value
already tells you what to do in this case: slow down your interactions
with them.<br><br>There are a handful of investors who will try to invest at a lower
valuation even when your price has already been set.  Lowering your
price is a backup plan you resort to when you discover you've let
the price get set too high to close all the money you need.  So
you'd only want to talk to this sort of investor if you were about
to do that anyway.  But since investor meetings have to be arranged
at least a few days in advance and you can't predict when you'll
need to resort to lowering your price, this means in practice that
you should approach this type of investor last if at all.<br><br>If you're surprised by a lowball offer, treat it as a backup offer
and delay responding to it.  When someone makes an offer in good
faith, you have a moral obligation to respond in a reasonable time.
But lowballing you is a dick move that should be met with the
corresponding countermove.<br><br>
<b>Accept offers greedily.</b><br><br>I'm a little leery of using the term "greedily" when writing about
fundraising lest non-programmers misunderstand me, but a greedy
algorithm is simply one that doesn't try to look into the future.
A greedy algorithm takes the best of the options in front of it
right now.  And that is how startups should approach fundraising
in phases 2 and later.  Don't try to look into the future because
(a) the future is unpredictable, and indeed in this business you're
often being deliberately misled about it and (b) your first priority
in fundraising should be to get it finished and get back to work
anyway.<br><br>If someone makes you an acceptable offer, take it.  If you have
multiple incompatible offers, take the best.  Don't reject an
acceptable offer in the hope of getting a better one in the future.<br><br>These simple rules cover a wide variety of cases.  If you're raising
money from many investors, roll them up as they say yes.  As you
start to feel you've raised enough, the threshold for acceptable
will start to get higher.<br><br>In practice offers exist for stretches of time, not points.  So
when you get an acceptable offer that would be incompatible with
others (e.g. an offer to invest most of the money you need), you
can tell the other investors you're talking to that you have an
offer good enough to accept, and give them a few days to make their
own.  This could lose you some that might have made an offer if
they had more time.  But by definition you don't care; the initial
offer was acceptable.<br><br>Some investors will try to prevent others from having time to decide
by giving you an "exploding" offer, meaning one that's only valid
for a few days.  Offers from the very best investors explode less
frequently and less rapidly — Fred Wilson never gives exploding
offers, for example — because they're confident you'll pick
them.  But lower-tier investors sometimes give offers with very
short fuses, because they believe no one who had other options would
choose them.  A deadline of three working days is acceptable.  You
shouldn't need more than that if you've been talking to investors
in parallel.  But a deadline any shorter is a sign you're dealing
with a sketchy investor.  You can usually call their bluff, and you
may need to.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f22n"><font color="#999999">22</font></a>]</font><br><br>It might seem that instead of accepting offers greedily, your goal
should be to get the best investors as partners.  That is certainly
a good goal, but in phase 2 "get the best investors" only rarely
conflicts with "accept offers greedily," because the best investors
don't usually take any longer to decide than the others.  The only
case where the two strategies give conflicting advice is when you
have to forgo an offer from an acceptable investor to see if you'll
get an offer from a better one.  If you talk to investors in parallel
and push back on exploding offers with excessively short deadlines,
that will almost never happen.  But if it does, "get the best
investors" is in the average case bad advice.  The best investors
are also the most selective, because they get their pick of all the
startups.  They reject nearly everyone they talk to, which means
in the average case it's a bad trade to exchange a definite offer
from an acceptable investor for a potential offer from a better
one.<br><br>(The situation is different in phase 1.  You can't apply to all the
incubators in parallel, because some offset their schedules to
prevent this.  In phase 1, "accept offers greedily" and "get the
best investors" do conflict, so if you want to apply to multiple
incubators, you should do it in such a way that the ones you want
most decide first.)<br><br>Sometimes when you're raising money from multiple investors, a
series A will emerge out of those conversations, and these rules
even cover what to do in that case.  When an investor starts to
talk to you about a series A, keep taking smaller investments till
they actually give you a termsheet.  There's no practical difficulty.
If the smaller investments are on convertible notes, they'll just
convert into the series A round.  The series A investor won't like
having all these other random investors as bedfellows, but if it
bothers them so much they should get on with giving you a termsheet.
Till they do, you don't know for sure they will, and the greedy
algorithm tells you what to do.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f23n"><font color="#999999">23</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>Don't sell more than 25% in phase 2.</b><br><br>If you do well, you will probably raise a series A round eventually.
I say probably because things are changing with series A rounds.
Startups may start to skip them.  But only one company we've funded
has so far, so tentatively assume the path to huge passes through
an A round.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f24n"><font color="#999999">24</font></a>]</font><br><br>Which means you should avoid doing things in earlier rounds that
will mess up raising an A round.  For example, if you've sold more
than about 40% of your company total, it starts to get harder to
raise an A round, because VCs worry there will not be enough stock
left to keep the founders motivated.<br><br>Our rule of thumb is not to sell more than 25% in phase 2, on top
of whatever you sold in phase 1, which should be less than 15%.  If
you're raising money on uncapped notes, you'll have to guess what
the eventual equity round valuation might be.  Guess conservatively.<br><br>(Since the goal of this rule is to avoid messing up the series A,
there's obviously an exception if you end up raising a series A in
phase 2, as a handful of startups do.)<br><br>
<b>Have one person handle fundraising.</b><br><br>If you have multiple founders, pick one to handle fundraising so
the other(s) can keep working on the company.  And since the danger
of fundraising is not the time taken up by the actual meetings but
that it becomes the top idea in your mind, the founder who handles
fundraising should make a conscious effort to insulate the other
founder(s) from the details of the process.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f25n"><font color="#999999">25</font></a>]</font><br><br>(If the founders mistrust one another, this could cause some friction.
But if the founders mistrust one another, you have worse problems
to worry about than how to organize fundraising.)<br><br>The founder who handles fundraising should be the CEO, who should
in turn be the most formidable of the founders.  Even if the CEO
is a programmer and another founder is a salesperson?  Yes.  If you
happen to be that type of founding team, you're effectively a single
founder when it comes to fundraising.<br><br>It's ok to bring all the founders to meet an investor who will
invest a lot, and who needs this meeting as the final step before
deciding.  But wait till that point.  Introducing an investor to
your cofounder(s) should be like introducing a girl/boyfriend to
your parents — something you do only when things reach a certain
stage of seriousness.<br><br>Even if there are still one or more founders focusing on the company
during fundraising, growth will slow.  But try to get as much growth
as you can, because fundraising is a segment of time, not a point,
and what happens to the company during that time affects the outcome.
If your numbers grow significantly between two investor meetings,
investors will be hot to close, and if your numbers are flat or
down they'll start to get cold feet.<br><br>
<b>You'll need an executive summary and (maybe) a deck.</b><br><br>Traditionally phase 2 fundraising consists of presenting a slide
deck in person to investors.  Sequoia describes what such a deck
should <a href="http://www.sequoiacap.com/ideas">contain</a>, and
since they're the customer you can take their word for it.<br><br>I say "traditionally" because I'm ambivalent about decks, and (though
perhaps this is wishful thinking) they seem to be on the way out.
A lot of the most successful startups we fund never make decks in
phase 2.  They just talk to investors and explain what they plan
to do.  Fundraising usually takes off fast for the startups that
are most successful at it, and they're thus able to excuse themselves
by saying that they haven't had time to make a deck.<br><br>You'll also want an executive summary, which should be no more than
a page long and describe in the most matter of fact language what
you plan to do, why it's a good idea, and what progress you've made
so far.  The point of the summary is to remind the investor (who
may have met many startups that day) what you talked about.<br><br>Assume that if you give someone a copy of your deck or executive
summary, it will be passed on to whoever you'd least like to have
it.  But don't refuse on that account to give copies to investors
you meet.  You just have to treat such leaks as a cost of doing
business.  In practice it's not that high a cost.  Though founders
are rightly indignant when their plans get leaked to competitors,
I can't think of a startup whose outcome has been affected by it.<br><br>Sometimes an investor will ask you to send them your deck and/or
executive summary before they decide whether to meet with you.  I
wouldn't do that.  It's a sign they're not really interested.<br><br>
<b>Stop fundraising when it stops working.</b><br><br>When do you stop fundraising?  Ideally when you've raised enough.
But what if you haven't raised as much as you'd like?  When do you
give up?<br><br>It's hard to give general advice about this, because there have
been cases of startups that kept trying to raise money even when
it seemed hopeless, and miraculously succeeded. But what I usually
tell founders is to stop fundraising when you start to get a lot
of air in the straw.  When you're drinking through a straw, you can
tell when you get to the end of the liquid because you start to get
a lot of air in the straw.  When your fundraising options run out,
they usually run out in the same way.  Don't keep sucking on the
straw if you're just getting air.  It's not going to get better.<br><br>
<b>Don't get addicted to fundraising.</b><br><br>Fundraising is a chore for most founders, but some find it more
interesting than working on their startup.  The work at an early
stage startup often consists of unglamorous <a href="schlep.html">schleps</a>.  Whereas fundraising, when it's
going well, can be quite the opposite.  Instead of sitting in your
grubby apartment listening to users complain about bugs in your
software, you're being offered millions of dollars by famous investors
over lunch at a nice restaurant.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f26n"><font color="#999999">26</font></a>]</font><br><br>The danger of fundraising is particularly acute for people who are
good at it.  It's always fun to work on something you're good at.
If you're one of these people, beware.  Fundraising is not what
will make your company successful.  Listening to users complain
about bugs in your software is what will make you successful.  And
the big danger of getting addicted to fundraising is not merely
that you'll spend too long on it or raise too much money.  It's
that you'll start to think of yourself as being already successful,
and lose your taste for the schleps you need to undertake to actually
be successful.  Startups can be destroyed by this.<br><br>When I see a startup with young founders that is fabulously successful
at fundraising, I mentally decrease my estimate of the probability
that they'll succeed.  The press may be writing about them as if
they'd been anointed as the next Google, but I'm thinking "this is
going to end badly."<br><br>
<b>Don't raise too much.</b><br><br>Though only a handful of startups have to worry about this, it is
possible to raise too much.  The dangers of raising too much are
subtle but insidious.  One is that it will set impossibly high
expectations.  If you raise an excessive amount of money, it will
be at a high valuation, and the danger of raising money at too high
a valuation is that you won't be able to increase it sufficiently
the next time you raise money.<br><br>A company's valuation is expected to rise each time it raises money.
If not it's a sign of a company in trouble, which makes you
unattractive to investors.  So if you raise money in phase 2 at a
post-money valuation of $30 million, the pre-money valuation of
your next round, if you want to raise one, is going to have to be
at least $50 million.  And you have to be doing really, really well
to raise money at $50 million.<br><br>It's very dangerous to let the competitiveness of your current round
set the performance threshold you have to meet to raise your next
one, because the two are only loosely coupled.<br><br>But the money itself may be more dangerous than the valuation.  The
more you raise, the more you spend, and spending a lot of money can
be disastrous for an early stage startup.  Spending a lot makes it
harder to become profitable, and perhaps even worse, it makes you
more rigid, because the main way to spend money is people, and the
more people you have, the harder it is to change directions.  So
if you do raise a huge amount of money, don't spend it.  (You will
find that advice almost impossible to follow, so hot will be the
money burning a hole in your pocket, but I feel obliged at least
to try.)<br><br>
<b>Be nice.</b><br><br>Startups raising money occasionally alienate investors by seeming
arrogant.  Sometimes because they are arrogant, and sometimes because
they're noobs clumsily attempting to mimic the toughness they've
observed in experienced founders.<br><br>It's a mistake to behave arrogantly to investors.  While there are
certain situations in which certain investors like certain kinds
of arrogance, investors vary greatly in this respect, and a flick
of the whip that will bring one to heel will make another roar with
indignation.  The only safe strategy is never to seem arrogant at
all.<br><br>That will require some diplomacy if you follow the advice I've given
here, because the advice I've given is essentially how to play
hardball back.  When you refuse to meet an investor because you're
not in fundraising mode, or slow down your interactions with an
investor who moves too slow, or treat a contingent offer as the no
it actually is and then, by accepting offers greedily, end up leaving
that investor out, you're going to be doing things investors don't
like.  So you must cushion the blow with soft words.  At YC we tell
startups they can blame us.  And now that I've written this, everyone
else can blame me if they want.  That plus the inexperience card
should work in most situations: sorry, we think you're great, but
PG said startups shouldn't ___, and since we're new to fundraising,
we feel like we have to play it safe.<br><br>The danger of behaving arrogantly is greatest when you're doing
well.  When everyone wants you, it's hard not to let it go to your
head.  Especially if till recently no one wanted you.  But restrain
yourself.  The startup world is a small place, and startups have
lots of ups and downs.  This is a domain where it's more true than
usual that pride goeth before a fall.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f27n"><font color="#999999">27</font></a>]</font><br><br>Be nice when investors reject you as well.  The best investors are
not wedded to their initial opinion of you.  If they reject you in
phase 2 and you end up doing well, they'll often invest in phase
3.  In fact investors who reject you are some of your warmest leads
for future fundraising.  Any investor who spent significant time
deciding probably came close to saying yes.  Often you have some
internal champion who only needs a little more evidence to convince
the skeptics.  So it's wise not merely to be nice to investors who
reject you, but (unless they behaved badly) to treat it as the
beginning of a relationship.<br><br>
<b>The bar will be higher next time.</b><br><br>Assume the money you raise in phase 2 will be the last you ever
raise.  You must make it to profitability on this money if you can.<br><br>Over the past several years, the investment community has evolved
from a strategy of anointing a small number of winners early and
then supporting them for years to a strategy of spraying money at
early stage startups and then ruthlessly culling them at the next
stage.  This is probably the optimal strategy for investors.  It's
too hard to pick winners early on.  Better to let the market do it
for you.  But it often comes as a surprise to startups how much
harder it is to raise money in phase 3.<br><br>When your company is only a couple months old, all it has to be is
a promising experiment that's worth funding to see how it turns
out.  The next time you raise money, the experiment has to have
worked.  You have to be on a trajectory that leads to going public.
And while there are some ideas where the proof that the experiment
worked might consist of e.g. query response times, usually the proof
is profitability.  Usually phase 3 fundraising has to be type A
fundraising.<br><br>In practice there are two ways startups hose themselves between
phases 2 and 3.  Some are just too slow to become profitable.  They
raise enough money to last for two years.  There doesn't seem any
particular urgency to be profitable.  So they don't make any effort
to make money for a year.  But by that time, not making money has
become habitual.  When they finally decide to try, they find they
can't.<br><br>The other way companies hose themselves is by letting their expenses
grow too fast.  Which almost always means hiring too many people.
You usually shouldn't go out and hire 8 people as soon as you raise
money at phase 2.  Usually you want to wait till you have growth
(and thus usually revenues) to justify them.  A lot of VCs will
encourage you to hire aggressively.  VCs generally tell you to spend
too much, partly because as money people they err on the side of
solving problems by spending money, and partly because they want
you to sell them more of your company in subsequent rounds.  Don't
listen to them.<br><br>
<b>Don't make things complicated.</b><br><br>I realize it may seem odd to sum up this huge treatise by saying
that my overall advice is not to make fundraising too complicated,
but if you go back and look at this list you'll see it's basically
a simple recipe with a lot of implications and edge cases.  Avoid
investors till you decide to raise money, and then when you do,
talk to them all in parallel, prioritized by expected value, and
accept offers greedily.  That's fundraising in one sentence.  Don't
introduce complicated optimizations, and don't let investors introduce
complications either.<br><br>Fundraising is not what will make you successful.  It's just a means
to an end.  Your primary goal should be to get it over with and get
back to what will make you successful — making things and talking
to users — and the path I've described will for most startups
be the surest way to that destination.<br><br>Be good, take care of yourselves, and <i>don't leave the path</i>.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
The worst explosions happen when unpromising-seeming startups
encounter mediocre investors.  Good investors don't lead startups
on; their reputations are too valuable.  And startups that seem
promising can usually get enough money from good investors that
they don't have to talk to mediocre ones.  It is the unpromising-seeming
startups that have to resort to raising money from mediocre investors.
And it's particularly damaging when these investors flake, because
unpromising-seeming startups are usually more desperate for money.<br><br>(Not all unpromising-seeming startups do badly.  Some are merely
ugly ducklings in the sense that they violate current startup
fashions.)<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
One YC founder told me:
</p><blockquote>
  I think in general we've done ok at fundraising, but I managed
  to screw up twice at the exact same thing — trying to focus
  on building the company and fundraising at the same time.
</blockquote>
[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
There is one subtle danger you have to watch out for here, which
I warn about later: beware of getting too high a valuation from an
eager investor, lest that set an impossibly high target when raising
additional money.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
If they really need a meeting, then they're not ready to invest,
regardless of what they say. They're still deciding, which means
you're being asked to come in and convince them. Which is fundraising.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Associates at VC firms regularly cold email startups.  Naive
founders think "Wow, a VC is interested in us!"  But an associate
is not a VC.  They have no decision-making power.  And while they
may introduce startups they like to partners at their firm, the
partners discriminate against deals that come to them this way.   I
don't know of a single VC investment that began with an associate
cold-emailing a startup.  If you want to approach a specific firm,
get an intro to a partner from someone they respect.<br><br>It's ok to talk to an associate if you get an intro to a VC firm
or they see you at a Demo Day and they begin by having an associate
vet you.  That's not a promising lead and should therefore get low
priority, but it's not as completely worthless as a cold email.<br><br>Because the title "associate" has gotten a bad reputation, a few
VC firms have started to give their associates the title "partner,"
which can make things very confusing.  If you're a YC startup you
can ask us who's who; otherwise you may have to do some research
online.  There may be a special title for actual partners.  If
someone speaks for the firm in the press or a blog on the firm's
site, they're probably a real partner.  If they're on boards of
directors they're probably a real partner.<br><br>There are titles between "associate" and "partner," including
"principal" and "venture partner."  The meanings of these titles
vary too much to generalize.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
For similar reasons, avoid casual conversations with potential
acquirers.  They can lead to distractions even more dangerous than
fundraising.  Don't even take a meeting with a potential acquirer
unless you want to sell your company right now.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Joshua Reeves specifically suggests asking each investor to
intro you to two more investors.<br><br>Don't ask investors who say no for introductions to other investors.
That will in many cases be an anti-recommendation.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
This is not always as deliberate as its sounds.  A lot of the
delays and disconnects between founders and investors are induced
by the customs of the venture business, which have evolved the way
they have because they suit investors' interests.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
One YC founder who read a draft of this essay wrote:
<blockquote>
  This is the most important section. I think it might bear stating
  even more clearly. "Investors will deliberately affect more
  interest than they have to preserve optionality. If an investor
  seems very interested in you, they still probably won't invest.
  The solution for this is to assume the worst — that an investor
  is just feigning interest — until you get a definite commitment."
</blockquote>

Though you should probably pack investor meetings as closely
as you can, Jeff Byun mentions one reason not to: if you pack
investor meetings too closely, you'll have less time for your pitch
to evolve.<br><br>Some founders deliberately schedule a handful of lame investors
first, to get the bugs out of their pitch.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
There is not an efficient market in this respect.  Some of the
most useless investors are also the highest maintenance.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
Incidentally, this paragraph is sales 101.  If you want to see
it in action, go talk to a car dealer.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
I know one very smooth founder who used to end investor meetings
with "So, can I count you in?" delivered as if it were "Can you
pass the salt?"   Unless you're very smooth (if you're not sure...),
do not do this yourself.  There is nothing more unconvincing, for
an investor, than a nerdy founder trying to deliver the lines meant
for a smooth one.<br><br>Investors are fine with funding nerds.  So if you're a nerd, just
try to be a good nerd, rather than doing a bad imitation of a smooth
salesman.<br><br>[<a name="f14n"><font color="#000000">14</font></a>]
Ian Hogarth suggests a good way to tell how serious potential
investors are: the resources they expend on you after the first
meeting.  An investor who's seriously interested will already be
working to help you even before they've committed.<br><br>[<a name="f15n"><font color="#000000">15</font></a>]
In principle you might have to think about so-called "signalling
risk."  If a prestigious VC makes a small seed investment in you,
what if they don't want to invest the next time you raise money?
Other investors might assume that the VC knows you well, since
they're an existing investor, and if they don't want to invest in
your next round, that must mean you suck.  The reason I say "in
principle" is that in practice signalling hasn't been much of a
problem so far.  It rarely arises, and in the few cases where it
does, the startup in question usually is doing badly and is doomed
anyway.<br><br>If you have the luxury of choosing among seed investors, you can
play it safe by excluding VC firms.  But it isn't critical to.<br><br>[<a name="f16n"><font color="#000000">16</font></a>]
Sometimes a competitor will deliberately threaten you with a
lawsuit just as you start fundraising, because they know you'll
have to disclose the threat to potential investors and they hope
this will make it harder for you to raise money.  If this happens
it will probably frighten you more than investors.  Experienced
investors know about this trick, and know the actual lawsuits rarely
happen. So if you're attacked in this way, be forthright with
investors.  They'll be more alarmed if you seem evasive than if you
tell them everything.<br><br>[<a name="f17n"><font color="#000000">17</font></a>]
A related trick is to claim that they'll only invest contingently
on other investors doing so because otherwise you'd be "undercapitalized."
This is almost always bullshit.  They can't estimate your minimum
capital needs that precisely.<br><br>[<a name="f18n"><font color="#000000">18</font></a>]
You won't hire all those 20 people at once, and you'll probably
have some revenues before 18 months are out.  But those too are
acceptable or at least accepted additions to the margin for error.<br><br>[<a name="f19n"><font color="#000000">19</font></a>]
Type A fundraising is so much better that it might even be
worth doing something different if it gets you there sooner.  One
YC founder told me that if he were a first-time founder again he'd
"leave ideas that are up-front capital intensive to founders with
established reputations."<br><br>[<a name="f20n"><font color="#000000">20</font></a>]
I don't know whether this happens because they're innumerate,
or because they believe they have zero ability to predict startup
outcomes (in which case this behavior at least wouldn't be irrational).
In either case the implications are similar.<br><br>[<a name="f21n"><font color="#000000">21</font></a>]
If you're a YC startup and you have an investor who for some
reason insists that you decide the price, any YC partner can estimate
a market price for you.<br><br>[<a name="f22n"><font color="#000000">22</font></a>]
You should respond in kind when investors behave upstandingly
too.  When an investor makes you a clean offer with no deadline,
you have a moral obligation to respond promptly.<br><br>[<a name="f23n"><font color="#000000">23</font></a>]
Tell the investors talking to you about an A round about the
smaller investments you raise as you raise them.  You owe them such
updates on your cap table, and this is also a good way to pressure
them to act.  They won't like you raising other money and may
pressure you to stop, but they can't legitimately ask you to commit
to them till they also commit to you.  If they want you to stop
raising money, the way to do it is to give you a series A termsheet
with a no-shop clause.<br><br>You can relent a little if the potential series A investor has a
great reputation and they're clearly working fast to get you a
termsheet, particularly if a third party like YC is involved to
ensure there are no misunderstandings.  But be careful.<br><br>[<a name="f24n"><font color="#000000">24</font></a>]
The company is Weebly, which made it to profitability on a
seed investment of $650k.  They did try to raise a series A in the
fall of 2008 but (no doubt partly because it was the fall of 2008)
the terms they were offered were so bad that they decided to skip
raising an A round.<br><br>[<a name="f25n"><font color="#000000">25</font></a>]
Another advantage of having one founder take fundraising
meetings is that you never have to negotiate in real time, which
is something inexperienced founders should avoid.  One YC founder
told me:
<blockquote>
  Investors are professional negotiators and can negotiate on the
  spot very easily.  If only one founder is in the room, you can
  say "I need to circle back with my co-founder" before making any
  commitments. I used to do this all the time.
</blockquote>
[<a name="f26n"><font color="#000000">26</font></a>]
You'll be lucky if fundraising feels pleasant enough to become
addictive.  More often you have to worry about the other
extreme — becoming demoralized when investors reject you.  As
one (very successful) YC founder wrote after reading a draft of
this:
<blockquote>
  It's hard to mentally deal with the sheer scale of rejection in
  fundraising and if you are not in the right mindset you will fail.
  Users may love you but these supposedly smart investors may not
  understand you at all. At this point for me, rejection still
  rankles but I've come to accept that investors are just not super
  thoughtful for the most part and you need to play the game according
  to certain somewhat depressing rules (many of which you are
  listing) in order to win.

October 2014<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a guest lecture in Sam Altman's <a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/">startup class</a> at
Stanford.  It's intended for college students, but much of it is
applicable to potential founders at other ages.)</i><br><br>One of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to give
advice, you can ask yourself "what would I tell my own kids?"  My
kids are little, but I can imagine what I'd tell them about startups
if they were in college, and that's what I'm going to tell you.<br><br>Startups are very counterintuitive.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe it's
just because knowledge about them hasn't permeated our culture yet.
But whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you
can't always trust your instincts.<br><br>It's like skiing in that way.  When you first try skiing and you
want to slow down, your instinct is to lean back.  But if you lean
back on skis you fly down the hill out of control.  So part of
learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse.  Eventually
you get new habits, but at first it takes a conscious effort.  At
first there's a list of things you're trying to remember as you
start down the hill.<br><br>Startups are as unnatural as skiing, so there's a similar list for
startups. Here I'm going to give you the first part of it — the things
to remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup.<br><br>
<b>Counterintuitive</b><br><br>The first item on it is the fact I already mentioned: that startups
are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot
of mistakes.  If you know nothing more than this, you may at least
pause before making them.<br><br>When I was running Y Combinator I used to joke that our function
was to tell founders things they would ignore.  It's really true.
Batch after batch, the YC partners warn founders about mistakes
they're about to make, and the founders ignore them, and then come
back a year later and say "I wish we'd listened."<br><br>Why do the founders ignore the partners' advice?  Well, that's the
thing about counterintuitive ideas: they contradict your intuitions.
They seem wrong.  So of course your first impulse is to disregard
them.  And in fact my joking description is not merely the curse
of Y Combinator but part of its raison d'etre. If founders' instincts
already gave them the right answers, they wouldn't need us.  You
only need other people to give you advice that surprises you. That's
why there are a lot of ski instructors and not many running
instructors.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>You can, however, trust your instincts about people.  And in fact
one of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to
do that enough.  They get involved with people who seem impressive,
but about whom they feel some misgivings personally.  Later when
things blow up they say "I knew there was something off about him,
but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive."<br><br>If you're thinking about getting involved with someone — as a
cofounder, an employee, an investor, or an acquirer — and you
have misgivings about them, trust your gut.  If someone seems
slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don't ignore it.<br><br>This is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent. Work with
people you genuinely like, and you've known long enough to be sure.<br><br>
<b>Expertise</b><br><br>The second counterintuitive point is that it's not that important
to know a lot about startups.  The way to succeed in a startup is
not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users
and the problem you're solving for them.
Mark Zuckerberg didn't succeed because he was an expert on startups.
He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups, because he
understood his users really well.<br><br>If you don't know anything about, say, how to raise an angel round,
don't feel bad on that account.  That sort of thing you can learn
when you need to, and forget after you've done it.<br><br>In fact, I worry it's not merely unnecessary to learn in great
detail about the mechanics of startups, but possibly somewhat
dangerous.  If I met an undergrad who knew all about convertible
notes and employee agreements and (God forbid) class FF stock, I
wouldn't think "here is someone who is way ahead of their peers."
It would set off alarms.  Because another of the characteristic
mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting
a startup.  They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money
at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people.
From the outside that seems like what startups do.  But the next
step after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually
realize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all
the outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thing
that's actually essential: making something people want.<br><br>
<b>Game</b><br><br>We saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing
house.  Eventually I realized why it was happening.  The reason
young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is
because that's what they've been trained to do for their whole lives
up to that point.  Think about what you have to do to get into
college, for example.  Extracurricular activities, check.  Even in
college classes most of the work is as artificial as running laps.<br><br>I'm not attacking the educational system for being this way. There
will always be a certain amount of fakeness in the work you do when
you're being taught something, and if you measure their performance
it's inevitable that people will exploit the difference to the point
where much of what you're measuring is artifacts of the fakeness.<br><br>I confess I did it myself in college. I found that in a lot of
classes there might only be 20 or 30 ideas that were the right shape
to make good exam questions.  The way I studied for exams in these
classes was not (except incidentally) to master the material taught
in the class, but to make a list of potential exam questions and
work out the answers in advance. When I walked into the final, the
main thing I'd be feeling was curiosity about which of my questions
would turn up on the exam.  It was like a game.<br><br>It's not surprising that after being trained for their whole lives
to play such games, young founders' first impulse on starting a
startup is to try to figure out the tricks for winning at this new
game. Since fundraising appears to be the measure of success for
startups (another classic noob mistake), they always want to know what the
tricks are for convincing investors.  We tell them the best way to
<a href="convince.html">convince investors</a> is to make a startup
that's actually doing well, meaning <a href="growth.html">growing fast</a>, and then simply
tell investors so.  Then they want to know what the tricks are for
growing fast.  And we have to tell them the best way to do that is
simply to make something people want.<br><br>So many of the conversations YC partners have with young founders
begin with the founder asking "How do we..." and the partner replying
"Just..."<br><br>Why do the founders always make things so complicated?  The reason,
I realized, is that they're looking for the trick.<br><br>So this is the third counterintuitive thing to remember about
startups: starting a startup is where gaming the system stops
working.  Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work
for a big company. Depending on how broken the company is, you can
succeed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impression
of productivity, and so on. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
But that doesn't work with startups.
There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is
whether your product does what they want. Startups are as impersonal
as physics.  You have to make something people want, and you prosper
only to the extent you do.<br><br>The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors.
If you're super good at sounding like you know what you're talking
about, you can fool investors for at least one and perhaps even two
rounds of funding.  But it's not in your interest to.  The company
is ultimately doomed.  All you're doing is wasting your own time
riding it down.<br><br>So stop looking for the trick. There are tricks in startups, as
there are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less
important than solving the real problem. A founder who knows nothing
about fundraising but has made something users love will have an
easier time raising money than one who knows every trick in the
book but has a flat usage graph. And more importantly, the founder
who has made something users love is the one who will go on to
succeed after raising the money.<br><br>Though in a sense it's bad news in that you're deprived of one of
your most powerful weapons, I think it's exciting that gaming the
system stops working when you start a startup.  It's exciting that
there even exist parts of the world where you win by doing good
work.  Imagine how depressing the world would be if it were all
like school and big companies, where you either have to spend a lot
of time on bullshit things or lose to people who do.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
I would
have been delighted if I'd realized in college that there were parts
of the real world where gaming the system mattered less than others,
and a few where it hardly mattered at all.  But there are, and this
variation is one of the most important things to consider when
you're thinking about your future.  How do you win in each type of
work, and what would you like to win by doing?
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>
<b>All-Consuming</b><br><br>That brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point: startups are
all-consuming.  If you start a startup, it will take over your life
to a degree you cannot imagine.  And if your startup succeeds, it
will take over your life for a long time: for several years at the
very least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your working
life.  So there is a real opportunity cost here.<br><br>Larry Page may seem to have an enviable life, but there are aspects
of it that are unenviable.  Basically at 25 he started running as
fast as he could and it must seem to him that he hasn't stopped to
catch his breath since.  Every day new shit happens in the Google
empire that only the CEO can deal with, and he, as CEO, has to deal
with it.  If he goes on vacation for even a week, a whole week's
backlog of shit accumulates.  And he has to bear this uncomplainingly,
partly because as the company's daddy he can never show fear or
weakness, and partly because billionaires get less than zero sympathy
if they talk about having difficult lives.  Which has the strange
side effect that the difficulty of being a successful startup founder
is concealed from almost everyone except those who've done it.<br><br>Y Combinator has now funded several companies that can be called
big successes, and in every single case the founders say the same
thing.  It never gets any easier.  The nature of the problems change.
You're worrying about construction delays at your London office
instead of the broken air conditioner in your studio apartment.
But the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything it
increases.<br><br>Starting a successful startup is similar to having kids in that
it's like a button you push that changes your life irrevocably.
And while it's truly wonderful having kids, there are a lot of
things that are easier to do before you have them than after.  Many
of which will make you a better parent when you do have kids. And
since you can delay pushing the button for a while, most people in
rich countries do.<br><br>Yet when it comes to startups, a lot of people seem to think they're
supposed to start them while they're still in college.  Are you
crazy?  And what are the universities thinking?  They go out of
their way to ensure their students are well supplied with contraceptives,
and yet they're setting up entrepreneurship programs and startup
incubators left and right.<br><br>To be fair, the universities have their hand forced here.  A lot
of incoming students are interested in startups.  Universities are,
at least de facto, expected to prepare them for their careers.  So
students who want to start startups hope universities can teach
them about startups.  And whether universities can do this or not,
there's some pressure to claim they can, lest they lose applicants
to other universities that do.<br><br>Can universities teach students about startups?  Yes and no.  They
can teach students about startups, but as I explained before, this
is not what you need to know.  What you need to learn about are the
needs of your own users, and you can't do that until you actually
start the company.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font>
So starting a startup is intrinsically
something you can only really learn by doing it.  And it's impossible
to do that in college, for the reason I just explained: startups
take over your life.  You can't start a startup for real as a
student, because if you start a startup for real you're not a student
anymore. You may be nominally a student for a bit, but you won't even
be that for long.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Given this dichotomy, which of the two paths should you take?  Be
a real student and not start a startup, or start a real startup and
not be a student?  I can answer that one for you. Do not start a
startup in college.  How to start a startup is just a subset of a
bigger problem you're trying to solve: how to have a good life.
And though starting a startup can be part of a good life for a lot
of ambitious people, age 20 is not the optimal time to do it.
Starting a startup is like a brutally fast depth-first search.  Most
people should still be searching breadth-first at 20.<br><br>You can do things in your early 20s that you can't do as well before
or after, like plunge deeply into projects on a whim and travel
super cheaply with no sense of a deadline.  For unambitious people,
this sort of thing is the dreaded "failure to launch," but for the
ambitious ones it can be an incomparably valuable sort of exploration.
If you start a startup at 20 and you're sufficiently successful,
you'll never get to do it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Mark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country.  He
can do other things most people can't, like charter jets to fly him
to foreign countries. But success has taken a lot of the serendipity
out of his life. Facebook is running him as much as he's running
Facebook. And while it can be very cool to be in the grip of a
project you consider your life's work, there are advantages to
serendipity too, especially early in life.  Among other things it
gives you more options to choose your life's work from.<br><br>There's not even a tradeoff here. You're not sacrificing anything
if you forgo starting a startup at 20, because you're more likely
to succeed if you wait.  In the unlikely case that you're 20 and
one of your side projects takes off like Facebook did, you'll face
a choice of running with it or not, and it may be reasonable to run
with it.  But the usual way startups take off is for the founders
to <a href="ds.html">make them</a> take off, and it's gratuitously
stupid to do that at 20.<br><br>
<b>Try</b><br><br>Should you do it at any age?  I realize I've made startups sound
pretty hard.  If I haven't, let me try again: starting a startup
is really hard.  What if it's too hard?  How can you tell if you're
up to this challenge?<br><br>The answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can't tell. Your
life so far may have given you some idea what your prospects might
be if you tried to become a mathematician, or a professional football
player.  But unless you've had a very strange life you haven't done
much that was <a href="really.html">like</a> being a startup founder.
Starting a startup will change you a lot.  So what you're trying
to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into,
and who can do that?<br><br>For the past 9 years it was my job to predict whether people would
have what it took to start successful startups.  It was easy to
tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be over
that threshold.  The hard part was predicting how <xa href="relres.html">tough and ambitious they would become.  There
may be no one who has more experience at trying to predict that,
so I can tell you how much an expert can know about it, and the
answer is: not much.  I learned to keep a completely open mind about
which of the startups in each batch would turn out to be the stars.<br><br>The founders sometimes think they know. Some arrive feeling sure
they will ace Y Combinator just as they've aced every one of the (few,
artificial, easy) tests they've faced in life so far.  Others arrive
wondering how they got in, and hoping YC doesn't discover whatever
mistake caused it to accept them.  But there is little correlation
between founders' initial attitudes and how well their companies
do.<br><br>I've read that the same is true in the military — that the
swaggering recruits are no more likely to turn out to be really
tough than the quiet ones. And probably for the same reason: that
the tests involved are so different from the ones in their previous
lives.<br><br>If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably
shouldn't do it.  But if you're merely unsure whether you're up to
it, the only way to find out is to try.  Just not now.<br><br>
<b>Ideas</b><br><br>So if you want to start a startup one day, what should you do in
college?  There are only two things you need initially: an idea and
cofounders.  And the m.o. for getting both is the same.  Which leads
to our sixth and last counterintuitive point: that the way to get
startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.<br><br>I've written a whole <a href="startupideas.html">essay</a> on this,
so I won't repeat it all here.  But the short version is that if
you make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, the ideas
you come up with will not merely be bad, but bad and plausible-sounding,
meaning you'll waste a lot of time on them before realizing they're
bad.<br><br>The way to come up with good startup ideas is to take a step back.
Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas,
turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any
conscious effort.  In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even
realize at first that they're startup ideas.<br><br>This is not only possible, it's how Apple, Yahoo, Google, and
Facebook all got started.  None of these companies were even meant
to be companies at first.  They were all just side projects.  The
best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great
ideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject
them as ideas for companies.<br><br>Ok, so how do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideas
form in unconsciously?  (1) Learn a lot about things that matter,
then (2) work on problems that interest you (3) with people you
like and respect.  The third part, incidentally, is how you get
cofounders at the same time as the idea.<br><br>The first time I wrote that paragraph, instead of "learn a lot about
things that matter," I wrote "become good at some technology." But
that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow.  What was
special about Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia was not that they were
experts in technology.  They were good at design, and perhaps even
more importantly, they were good at organizing groups and making
projects happen.  So you don't have to work on technology per se,
so long as you work on problems demanding enough to stretch you.<br><br>What kind of problems are those?  That is very hard to answer in
the general case.  History is full of examples of young people who
were working on important problems that <a href="marginal.html">no
one else</a> at the time thought were important, and in particular
that their parents didn't think were important.  On the other hand,
history is even fuller of examples of parents who thought their
kids were wasting their time and who were right.  So how do you
know when you're working on real stuff?
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>I know how <i>I</i> know.  Real problems are interesting, and I am
self-indulgent in the sense that I always want to work on interesting
things, even if no one else cares about them (in fact, especially
if no one else cares about them), and find it very hard to make
myself work on boring things, even if they're supposed to be
important.<br><br>My life is full of case after case where I worked on something just
because it seemed interesting, and it turned out later to be useful
in some worldly way.  <a href="http://ycombinator.com/start.html">Y
Combinator itself</a> was something I only did because it seemed
interesting. So I seem to have some sort of internal compass that
helps me out.  But I don't know what other people have in their
heads. Maybe if I think more about this I can come up with heuristics
for recognizing genuinely interesting problems, but for the moment
the best I can offer is the hopelessly question-begging advice that
if you have a taste for genuinely interesting problems, indulging
it energetically is the best way to prepare yourself for a startup.
And indeed, probably also the best way to live.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>But although I can't explain in the general case what counts as an
interesting problem, I can tell you about a large subset of them.
If you think of technology as something that's spreading like a
sort of fractal stain, every moving point on the edge represents
an interesting problem.  So one guaranteed way to turn your mind
into the type that has good startup ideas is to get yourself to the
leading edge of some technology — to cause yourself, as Paul
Buchheit put it, to "live in the future." When you reach that point,
ideas that will seem to other people uncannily prescient will seem
obvious to you.  You may not realize they're startup ideas, but
you'll know they're something that ought to exist.<br><br>For example, back at Harvard in the mid 90s a fellow grad student
of my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice over IP software.
He didn't mean it to be a startup, and he never tried to turn it
into one.  He just wanted to talk to his girlfriend in Taiwan without
paying for long distance calls, and since he was an expert on
networks it seemed obvious to him that the way to do it was turn
the sound into packets and ship it over the Internet. He never did
any more with his software than talk to his girlfriend, but this
is exactly the way the best startups get started.<br><br>So strangely enough the optimal thing to do in college if you want
to be a successful startup founder is not some sort of new, vocational
version of college focused on "entrepreneurship." It's the classic
version of college as education for its own sake. If you want to
start a startup after college, what you should do in college is
learn powerful things.  And if you have genuine intellectual
curiosity, that's what you'll naturally tend to do if you just
follow your own inclinations.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain
expertise.  The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert
on search. And the way to become an expert on search was to be
driven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.<br><br>At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for
curiosity.  And you'll do it best if you introduce the ulterior
motive toward the end of the process.<br><br>So here is the ultimate advice for young would-be startup founders,
boiled down to two words: just learn.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Some founders listen more than others, and this tends to be a
<a href="word.html">predictor of success</a>. One of the things I
remember about the Airbnbs during YC is how intently they listened.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In fact, this is one of the reasons startups are possible.  If
big companies weren't plagued by internal inefficiencies, they'd
be proportionately more effective, leaving less room for startups.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
In a startup you have to spend a lot of time on <a href="schlep.html">schleps</a>, but this sort of work is merely
unglamorous, not bogus.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
What should you do if your true calling is gaming the system?
Management consulting.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
The company may not be incorporated, but if you start to get
significant numbers of users, you've started it, whether you realize
it yet or not.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
It shouldn't be that surprising that colleges can't teach
students how to be good startup founders, because they can't teach
them how to be good employees either.<br><br>The way universities "teach" students how to be employees is to
hand off the task to companies via internship programs.  But you
couldn't do the equivalent thing for startups, because by definition
if the students did well they would never come back.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Charles Darwin was 22 when he received an invitation to travel
aboard the HMS Beagle as a naturalist.  It was only because he was
otherwise unoccupied, to a degree that alarmed his family, that he
could accept it. And yet if he hadn't we probably would not know
his name.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Parents can sometimes be especially conservative in this
department.  There are some whose definition of important problems
includes only those on the critical path to med school.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
I did manage to think of a heuristic for detecting whether you
have a taste for interesting ideas: whether you find known boring
ideas intolerable.  Could you endure studying literary theory, or
working in middle management at a large company?<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
In fact, if your goal is to start a startup, you can stick
even more closely to the ideal of a liberal education than past
generations have. Back when students focused mainly on getting a
job after college, they thought at least a little about how the
courses they took might look to an employer.  And perhaps even
worse, they might shy away from taking a difficult class lest they
get a low grade, which would harm their all-important GPA.  Good
news: users <a href="credentials.html">don't care</a> what your GPA
was.  And I've never heard of investors caring either.  Y Combinator
certainly never asks what classes you took in college or what grades
you got in them.<br><br>

are mean.  There are exceptions, but remarkably few.<br><br>Meanness isn't rare.  In fact, one of the things the internet has
shown us is how mean people can be.  A few decades ago, only famous
people and professional writers got to publish their opinions.  Now
everyone can, and we can all see the <xa href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpOEO2gUekE">long tail of
meanness that had previously been hidden.<br><br>And yet while there are clearly a lot of mean people out there,
there are next to none among the most successful people I know.
What's going on here?  Are meanness and success inversely correlated?<br><br>Part of what's going on, of course, is selection bias.  I only know
people who work in certain fields: startup founders, programmers,
professors. I'm willing to believe that successful people in other
fields are mean.  Maybe successful hedge fund managers are mean; I
don't know enough to say.  It seems quite likely that most successful
drug lords are mean.  But there are at least big chunks of the world
that mean people don't rule, and that territory seems to be growing.<br><br>My wife and Y Combinator cofounder Jessica is one of those rare
people who have x-ray vision for character. Being married to her
is like standing next to an airport baggage scanner. She came to
the startup world from investment banking, and she has always been
struck both by how consistently successful startup founders turn
out to be good people, and how consistently bad people fail as
startup founders.<br><br>Why?  I think there are several reasons.  One is that being mean
makes you stupid. That's why I hate fights. You never do your best
work in a fight, because fights are not sufficiently general.
Winning is always a function of the situation and the people involved.
You don't win fights by thinking of big ideas but by thinking of
tricks that work in one particular case.  And yet fighting is just
as much work as thinking about real problems. Which is particularly
painful to someone who cares how their brain is used: your brain
goes fast but you get nowhere, like a car spinning its wheels.<br><br>Startups don't win by attacking. They win by transcending. There
are exceptions of course, but usually the way to win is to race
ahead, not to stop and fight.<br><br>Another reason mean founders lose is that they can't get the best
people to work for them. They can hire people who will put up with
them because they need a job. But the best people have other options.
A mean person can't convince the best people to work for him unless
he is super convincing. And while having the best people helps any
organization, it's critical for startups.<br><br>There is also a complementary force at work: if you want to build
great things, it helps to be driven by a spirit of <xa href="good.html">benevolence. The startup founders who end up
richest are not the ones driven by money.  The ones driven by money
take the big acquisition offer that nearly every successful startup
gets en route.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
The ones who keep going are driven by something
else. They may not say so explicitly, but they're usually trying
to improve the world.  Which means people with a desire to improve
the world have a natural advantage.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The exciting thing is that startups are not just one random type
of work in which meanness and success are inversely correlated.
This kind of work is the future.<br><br>For most of history success meant control of scarce resources.  One
got that by fighting, whether literally in the case of pastoral
nomads driving hunter-gatherers into marginal lands, or metaphorically
in the case of Gilded Age financiers contending with one another
to assemble railroad monopolies. For most of history, success meant
success at zero-sum games. And in most of them meanness was not a
handicap but probably an advantage.<br><br>That is changing. Increasingly the games that matter are not zero-sum.
Increasingly you win not by fighting to get control of a scarce
resource, but by having new ideas and building new things.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>There have long been games where you won by having new ideas. In
the third century BC, Archimedes won by doing that. At least until
an invading Roman army killed him. Which illustrates why
this change is happening: for new ideas to matter, you need a certain
degree of civil order.  And not just not being at war.  You also
need to prevent the sort of economic violence that nineteenth century
magnates practiced against one another and communist countries
practiced against their citizens.  People need to feel that what
they create can't be stolen.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>That has always been the case for thinkers, which is why this trend
began with them.  When you think of successful people from history
who weren't ruthless, you get mathematicians and writers and artists.
The exciting thing is that their m.o. seems to be spreading.  The
games played by intellectuals are leaking into the real world, and
this is reversing the historical polarity of the relationship between
meanness and success.<br><br>So I'm really glad I stopped to think about this. Jessica and I
have always worked hard to teach our kids not to be mean.  We
tolerate noise and mess and junk food, but not meanness.  And now
I have both an additional reason to crack down on it, and an
additional argument to use when I do: that being mean makes you
fail.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I'm not saying all founders who take big acquisition offers
are driven only by money, but rather that those who don't aren't.
Plus one can have benevolent motives for being driven by money — for 
example, to take care of one's family, or to be free to work
on projects that improve the world.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
It's unlikely that every successful startup improves the
world.  But their founders, like parents, truly believe they do.
Successful founders are in love with their companies.  And while
this sort of love is as blind as the love people have for one
another, it is genuine.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
<a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec05">Peter 
Thiel</a> would point out that successful founders still
get rich from controlling monopolies, just monopolies they create
rather than ones they capture.  And while this is largely true, it
means a big change in the sort of person who wins.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
To be fair, the Romans didn't mean to kill Archimedes.  The
Roman commander specifically ordered that he be spared. But he got
killed in the chaos anyway.<br><br>In sufficiently disordered times, even thinking requires
control of scarce resources, because living at all is a scarce
resource.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Ron Conway, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris,

although they have a significant amount of money in the bank, they're
also losing a lot each month, and revenue growth is either nonexistent
or mediocre.  The company has, say, 6 months of runway.  Or to put
it more brutally, 6 months before they're out of business.  They
expect to avoid that by raising more from investors.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>That last sentence is the fatal one.<br><br>There may be nothing founders are so prone to delude themselves
about as how interested investors will be in giving them additional
funding.  It's hard to convince investors the first time too, but
founders expect that.  What bites them the second time is a confluence
of three forces:
<ol>
<li> The company is spending more now than it did the first time
  it raised money.<br><br></li><li> Investors have much higher standards for companies that have
  already raised money.<br><br></li><li> The company is now starting to read as a failure. The first
  time it raised money, it was neither a success nor a failure; it
  was too early to ask. Now it's possible to ask that question, and
  the default answer is failure, because at this point that is the
  default outcome.
</li></ol>
I'm going to call the situation I described in the first paragraph "the fatal pinch." I try to resist
coining phrases, but making up a name for this situation may snap
founders into realizing when they're in it.<br><br>One of the things that makes the fatal pinch so dangerous is
that it's self-reinforcing.  Founders overestimate their chances
of raising more money, and so are slack about reaching
profitability, which further decreases their chances of raising
money.<br><br>Now that you know about the fatal pinch, how do you avoid it?  Y&nbsp;Combinator tells
founders who raise money to act as if it's the last they'll ever
get.  Because the self-reinforcing nature of this situation works
the other way too: the less you need further investment, the easier
it is to get.<br><br>What do you do if you're already in the fatal pinch?  The
first step is to re-evaluate the probability of raising more money.
I will now, by an amazing feat of clairvoyance, do this for you:
the probability is zero. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Three options remain: you can shut down the company, you can increase
how much you make, and you can decrease how much you spend.<br><br>You should shut down the company if you're certain it will
fail no matter what you do.  Then at least you can give back the
money you have left, and save yourself however many months you would
have spent riding it down.<br><br>Companies rarely <i>have</i> to fail though.  What I'm really doing
here is giving you the option of admitting you've already given up.<br><br>If you don't want to shut down the company, that leaves increasing
revenues and decreasing expenses.  In most startups, expenses =
people, and decreasing expenses = firing people.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
Deciding to
fire people is usually hard, but there's one case in which it
shouldn't be: when there are people you already know you should
fire but you're in denial about it.  If so, now's the time.<br><br>If that makes you profitable, or will enable you to make it to
profitability on the money you have left, you've avoided the immediate
danger.<br><br>Otherwise you have three options: you either have to fire good
people, get some or all of the employees to take less salary for a
while, or increase revenues.<br><br>Getting people to take less salary is a weak solution that will
only work when the problem isn't too bad.  If your current trajectory
won't quite get you to profitability but you can get over the threshold
by cutting salaries a little,
you might be able to make the case to everyone for doing it.
Otherwise you're probably just postponing the problem, and that
will be obvious to the people whose salaries you're proposing to
cut.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Which leaves two options, firing good people and making more money.
While trying to balance them, keep in mind the eventual goal: to be
a successful product company in the sense of having a single thing
lots of people use.<br><br>You should lean more toward firing people if the source of your
trouble is overhiring. If you went out and hired 15 people before
you even knew what you were building, you've created a broken
company.  You need to figure out what you're building, and it will
probably be easier to do that with a handful of people than 15.
Plus those 15 people might not even be the ones you need for whatever
you end up building.  So the solution may be to shrink and then
figure out what direction to grow in.  After all, you're not doing
those 15 people any favors if you fly the company into ground with
them aboard.  They'll all lose their jobs eventually, along with
all the time they expended on this doomed company.<br><br>Whereas if you only have a handful of people, it may be better to
focus on trying to make more money.  It may seem facile to suggest
a startup make more money, as if that could be done for the asking.
Usually a startup is already trying as hard as it can to sell
whatever it sells.  What I'm suggesting here is not so much to try
harder to make money but to try to make money in a different way.
For example, if you have only one person selling while the rest are
writing code, consider having everyone work on selling.  What good
will more code do you when you're out of business?  
If you have to write code to close a certain deal, go ahead;
that follows from everyone working on selling.  But only work on
whatever will get you the most revenue the soonest.<br><br>Another way to make money differently is to sell different things,
and in particular to do more consultingish work.  I say consultingish
because there is a long slippery slope from making products to pure
consulting, and you don't have to go far down it before you start
to offer something really attractive to customers. Although your
product may not be very appealing yet, if you're a startup your
programmers will often be way better than the ones your customers
have.  Or you may have expertise in some new field they
don't understand.  So if you change your sales conversations
just a little from "do you want to buy our product?" to "what do
you need that you'd pay a lot for?" you may find it's suddenly a
lot easier to extract money from customers.<br><br>Be ruthlessly mercenary when you start doing this, though. You're
trying to save your company from death here, so make customers pay
a lot, quickly. And to the extent you can, try to avoid the
worst pitfalls of consulting.  The ideal thing might be if you built
a precisely defined derivative version of your product for the
customer, and it was otherwise a straight product sale.  You keep
the IP and no billing by the hour.<br><br>In the best case, this consultingish work may not be just something
you do to survive, but may turn out to be the <a href="ds.html">thing-that-doesn't-scale</a> that defines your
company.  Don't expect it to be, but as you dive into individual
users' needs, keep your eyes open for narrow openings that have
wide vistas beyond.<br><br>There is usually so much demand for custom work that unless you're
really incompetent there has to be some point down the slope of
consulting at which you can survive.  But I didn't use the term
slippery slope by accident; customers' insatiable demand for custom
work will always be pushing you toward the bottom.  So while you'll
probably survive, the problem now becomes to survive with the least
damage and distraction.<br><br>The good news is, plenty of successful startups have passed through
near-death experiences and gone on to flourish.  You just have to
realize in time that you're near death.  And if you're in the fatal pinch,
you are.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
There are a handful of companies that can't reasonably expect
to make money for the first year or two, because what they're
building takes so long.  For these companies substitute "progress"
for "revenue growth."  You're not one of these companies unless
your initial investors agreed in advance that you were.  And frankly
even these companies wish they weren't, because the illiquidity of
"progress" puts them at the mercy of investors.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There's a variant of the fatal pinch where your existing
investors help you along by promising to invest more.  Or rather,
where you read them as promising to invest more, while they think
they're just mentioning the possibility.  The way to solve this
problem, if you have 8 months of runway or less, is to try to get
the money right now.  Then you'll either get the money, in which
case (immediate) problem solved, or at least prevent your investors
from helping you to remain in denial about your fundraising prospects.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Obviously, if you have significant expenses other than salaries
that you can eliminate, do it now.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Unless of course the source of the problem is that you're paying
yourselves high salaries.  If by cutting the founders' salaries to
the minimum you need, you can make it to profitability, you should.
But it's a bad sign if you needed to read this to realize that.<br><br>

two times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything
I remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a
page.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy
feeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all
these books if I remember so little from them?<br><br>A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent
biography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this
question, at least something that made me feel better about it.
She writes:
<blockquote>
  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled
  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a
  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that "a perfect
  formulation of a problem is already half its solution."
</blockquote>
That has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even
more convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.<br><br>But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A
combination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None
of which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget
that Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the
importance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from
this book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.<br><br>Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if
you forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model
of the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've
lost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.<br><br>The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle
is not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,
Venice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't
mean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest
of reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.<br><br>This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But
it was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who
felt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.<br><br>Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about
forgetting, though.  There are specific implications.<br><br>For example, reading and experience are usually "compiled" at the
time they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The
same book would get compiled differently at different points in
your life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important
books multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about
rereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work
like carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you
did it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase "already read"
seems almost ill-formed.<br><br>Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology
will increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When
people do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when
looking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in
their compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering
the childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as
technologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it
may become common for people to relive experiences without any goal
in mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading
a book.<br><br>Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but
also to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you
know things may seem part of being human, it may not be.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

confidence in our beliefs.  The more (and more varied) experience
a belief survived, the less likely it would be false.  Most people
implicitly believe something like this about their opinions.  And
they're justified in doing so with opinions about things that don't
change much, like human nature.  But you can't trust your opinions
in the same way about things that change, which could include
practically everything else.<br><br>When experts are wrong, it's often because they're experts on an
earlier version of the world.<br><br>Is it possible to avoid that?  Can you protect yourself against
obsolete beliefs?  To some extent, yes. I spent almost a decade
investing in early stage startups, and curiously enough protecting
yourself against obsolete beliefs is exactly what you have to do
to succeed as a startup investor.  Most really good startup ideas
look like bad ideas at first, and many of those look bad specifically
because some change in the world just switched them from bad to
good.  I spent a lot of time learning to recognize such ideas, and
the techniques I used may be applicable to ideas in general.<br><br>The first step is to have an explicit belief in change.  People who
fall victim to a monotonically increasing confidence in their
opinions are implicitly concluding the world is static.  If you
consciously remind yourself it isn't, you start to look for change.<br><br>Where should one look for it?  Beyond the moderately useful
generalization that human nature doesn't change much, the unfortunate
fact is that change is hard to predict.  This is largely a tautology
but worth remembering all the same: change that matters usually
comes from an unforeseen quarter.<br><br>So I don't even try to predict it.  When I get asked in interviews
to predict the future, I always have to struggle to come up with
something plausible-sounding on the fly, like a student who hasn't
prepared for an exam.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
But it's not out of laziness that I haven't
prepared.  It seems to me that beliefs about the future are so
rarely correct that they usually aren't worth the extra rigidity
they impose, and that the best strategy is simply to be aggressively
open-minded.  Instead of trying to point yourself in the right
direction, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, and
try instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change.<br><br>It's ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain
you a bit, because they also motivate you.  It's exciting to chase
things and exciting to try to guess answers.  But you have to be
disciplined about not letting your hypotheses harden into anything
more.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>I believe this passive m.o. works not just for evaluating new ideas
but also for having them.  The way to come up with new ideas is not
to try explicitly to, but to try to solve problems and simply not
discount weird hunches you have in the process.<br><br>The winds of change originate in the unconscious minds of domain
experts.  If you're sufficiently expert in a field, any weird idea
or apparently irrelevant question that occurs to you is ipso facto
worth exploring. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
 Within Y Combinator, when an idea is described
as crazy, it's a compliment—in fact, on average probably a
higher compliment than when an idea is described as good.<br><br>Startup investors have extraordinary incentives for correcting
obsolete beliefs.  If they can realize before other investors that
some apparently unpromising startup isn't, they can make a huge
amount of money.  But the incentives are more than just financial.
Investors' opinions are explicitly tested: startups come to them
and they have to say yes or no, and then, fairly quickly, they learn
whether they guessed right.  The investors who say no to a Google
(and there were several) will remember it for the rest of their
lives.<br><br>Anyone who must in some sense bet on ideas rather than merely
commenting on them has similar incentives.  Which means anyone who
wants such incentives can have them, by turning their comments into
bets: if you write about a topic in some fairly durable and public
form, you'll find you worry much more about getting things right
than most people would in a casual conversation.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another trick I've found to protect myself against obsolete beliefs
is to focus initially on people rather than ideas. Though the nature
of future discoveries is hard to predict, I've found I can predict
quite well what sort of people will make them.  Good new ideas come
from earnest, energetic, independent-minded people.<br><br>Betting on people over ideas saved me countless times as an investor.
We thought Airbnb was a bad idea, for example. But we could tell
the founders were earnest, energetic, and independent-minded.
(Indeed, almost pathologically so.)  So we suspended disbelief and
funded them.<br><br>This too seems a technique that should be generally applicable.
Surround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from.  If
you want to notice quickly when your beliefs become obsolete, you
can't do better than to be friends with the people whose discoveries
will make them so.<br><br>It's hard enough already not to become the prisoner of your own
expertise, but it will only get harder, because change is accelerating.
That's not a recent trend; change has been accelerating since the
paleolithic era.  Ideas beget ideas.  I don't expect that to change.
But I could be wrong.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
My usual trick is to talk about aspects of the present that
most people haven't noticed yet.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Especially if they become well enough known that people start
to identify them with you.  You have to be extra skeptical about
things you want to believe, and once a hypothesis starts to be
identified with you, it will almost certainly start to be in that
category.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
In practice "sufficiently expert" doesn't require one to be
recognized as an expert—which is a trailing indicator in any
case.  In many fields a year of focused work plus caring a lot would
be enough.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Though they are public and persist indefinitely, comments on
e.g. forums and places like Twitter seem empirically to work like
casual conversation.  The threshold may be whether what you write
has a title.<br><br>

easier because they say they can't find enough programmers in the
US.  Anti-immigration people say that instead of letting foreigners
take these jobs, we should train more Americans to be programmers.
Who's right?<br><br>The technology companies are right. What the anti-immigration people
don't understand is that there is a huge variation in ability between
competent programmers and exceptional ones, and while you can train
people to be competent, you can't train them to be exceptional.
Exceptional programmers have an aptitude for and 
<a href="genius.html"><u>interest in</u></a>
programming that is not merely the product of training.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The US has less than 5% of the world's population.  Which means if
the qualities that make someone a great programmer are evenly
distributed, 95% of great programmers are born outside the US.<br><br>The anti-immigration people have to invent some explanation to
account for all the effort technology companies have expended trying
to make immigration easier.  So they claim it's because they want
to drive down salaries.  But if you talk to startups, you find
practically every one over a certain size has gone through legal
contortions to get programmers into the US, where they then
paid them the same as they'd have paid an American.  Why would they
go to extra trouble to get programmers for the same price?  The
only explanation is that they're telling the truth: there are just
not enough great programmers to go around.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>I asked the CEO of a startup with about 70 programmers how many
more he'd hire if he could get all the great programmers he wanted.
He said "We'd hire 30 tomorrow morning."  And this is one of the
hot startups that always win recruiting battles. It's the same all
over Silicon Valley.  Startups are that constrained for talent.<br><br>It would be great if more Americans were trained as programmers,
but no amount of training can flip a ratio as overwhelming as 95
to 5. Especially since programmers are being trained in other
countries too.  Barring some cataclysm, it will always be true that
most great programmers are born outside the US.  It will always be
true that most people who are great at anything are born outside
the US.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Exceptional performance implies immigration.  A country with only
a few percent of the world's population will be exceptional in some
field only if there are a lot of immigrants working in it.<br><br>But this whole discussion has taken something for granted: that if
we let more great programmers into the US, they'll want to come.
That's true now, and we don't realize how lucky we are that it is.
If we want to keep this option open, the best way to do it is to
take advantage of it: the more of the world's great programmers are
here, the more the rest will want to come here.<br><br>And if we don't, the US could be seriously fucked. I realize that's
strong language, but the people dithering about this don't seem to
realize the power of the forces at work here.  Technology gives the
best programmers huge leverage.  The world market in programmers
seems to be becoming dramatically more liquid.  And since good
people like good colleagues, that means the best programmers could
collect in just a few hubs.  Maybe mostly in one hub.<br><br>What if most of the great programmers collected in one hub, and it
wasn't here?  That scenario may seem unlikely now, but it won't be
if things change as much in the next 50 years as they did in the
last 50.<br><br>We have the potential to ensure that the US remains a technology
superpower just by letting in a few thousand great programmers a
year.  What a colossal mistake it would be to let that opportunity
slip.  It could easily be the defining mistake this generation of
American politicians later become famous for.  And unlike other
potential mistakes on that scale, it costs nothing to fix.<br><br>So please, get on with it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
How much better is a great programmer than an ordinary one?
So much better that you can't even measure the difference directly.
A great programmer doesn't merely do the same work faster.  A great
programmer will invent things an ordinary programmer would never
even think of.  This doesn't mean a great programmer is infinitely
more valuable, because any invention has a finite market value.
But it's easy to imagine cases where a great programmer might invent
things worth 100x or even 1000x an average programmer's salary.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There are a handful of consulting firms that rent out big
pools of foreign programmers they bring in on H1-B visas.  By all
means crack down on these.  It should be easy to write legislation
that distinguishes them, because they are so different from technology
companies.  But it is dishonest of the anti-immigration people to
claim that companies like Google and Facebook are driven by the
same motives.  An influx of inexpensive but mediocre programmers
is the last thing they'd want; it would destroy them.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Though this essay talks about programmers, the group of people
we need to import is broader, ranging from designers to programmers
to electrical engineers.  The best one could do as a general term
might be "digital talent." It seemed better to make the argument a
little too narrow than to confuse everyone with a neologism.<br><br>

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><div><div><div></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></div><div><br><br><div><h1 id="corpdev">Don't Talk to Corp Dev</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">January 2015<br><br>Corporate Development, aka corp dev, is the group within companies
that buys other companies. If you're talking to someone from corp
dev, that's why, whether you realize it yet or not.<br><br>It's usually a mistake to talk to corp dev unless (a) you want to
sell your company right now and (b) you're sufficiently likely to
get an offer at an acceptable price.  In practice that means startups
should only talk to corp dev when they're either doing really well
or really badly.  If you're doing really badly, meaning the company
is about to die, you may as well talk to them, because you have
nothing to lose. And if you're doing really well, you can safely
talk to them, because you both know the price will have to be high,
and if they show the slightest sign of wasting your time, you'll
be confident enough to tell them to get lost.<br><br>The danger is to companies in the middle.  Particularly to young
companies that are growing fast, but haven't been doing it for long
enough to have grown big yet.  It's usually a mistake for a promising
company less than a year old even to talk to corp dev.<br><br>But it's a mistake founders constantly make.  When someone from
corp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should
at least find out what they want.  Besides, they don't want to
offend Big Company by refusing to meet.<br><br>Well, I'll tell you what they want.  They want to talk about buying
you.  That's what the title "corp dev" means.   So before agreeing
to meet with someone from corp dev, ask yourselves, "Do we want to
sell the company right now?"  And if the answer is no, tell them
"Sorry, but we're focusing on growing the company."  They won't be
offended.  And certainly the founders of Big Company won't be
offended. If anything they'll think more highly of you.  You'll
remind them of themselves.  They didn't sell either; that's why
they're in a position now to buy other companies.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Most founders who get contacted by corp dev already know what it
means.  And yet even when they know what corp dev does and know
they don't want to sell, they take the meeting.  Why do they do it?
The same mix of denial and wishful thinking that underlies most
mistakes founders make. It's flattering to talk to someone who wants
to buy you.  And who knows, maybe their offer will be surprisingly
high.  You should at least see what it is, right?<br><br>No.  If they were going to send you an offer immediately by email,
sure, you might as well open it.  But that is not how conversations
with corp dev work.  If you get an offer at all, it will be at the
end of a long and unbelievably distracting process.  And if the
offer is surprising, it will be surprisingly low.<br><br>Distractions are the thing you can least afford in a startup.  And
conversations with corp dev are the worst sort of distraction,
because as well as consuming your <a href="top.html">attention</a> they undermine your
morale.  One of the tricks to surviving a grueling process is not
to stop and think how tired you are.  Instead you get into a sort
of flow. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font>
Imagine what it would do to you if at mile 20 of a
marathon, someone ran up beside you and said "You must feel really
tired.  Would you like to stop and take a rest?"  Conversations
with corp dev are like that but worse, because the suggestion of
stopping gets combined in your mind with the imaginary high price
you think they'll offer.<br><br>And then you're really in trouble.  If they can, corp dev people
like to turn the tables on you. They like to get you to the point
where you're trying to convince them to buy instead of them trying
to convince you to sell.  And surprisingly often they succeed.<br><br>This is a very slippery slope, greased with some of the most powerful
forces that can work on founders' minds, and attended by an experienced
professional whose full time job is to push you down it.<br><br>Their tactics in pushing you down that slope are usually fairly
brutal. Corp dev people's whole job is to buy companies, and they
don't even get to choose which.  The only way their performance is
measured is by how cheaply they can buy you, and the more ambitious
ones will stop at nothing to achieve that. For example, they'll
almost always start with a lowball offer, just to see if you'll
take it. Even if you don't, a low initial offer will demoralize you
and make you easier to manipulate.<br><br>And that is the most innocent of their tactics. Just wait till
you've agreed on a price and think you have a done deal, and then
they come back and say their boss has vetoed the deal and won't do
it for more than half the agreed upon price. Happens all the time.
If you think investors can behave badly, it's nothing compared to
what corp dev people can do.  Even corp dev people at companies
that are otherwise benevolent.<br><br>I remember once complaining to a
friend at Google about some nasty trick their corp dev people had
pulled on a YC startup.<br><br>"What happened to Don't be Evil?" I asked.<br><br>"I don't think corp dev got the memo," he replied.<br><br>The tactics you encounter in M&amp;A conversations can be like nothing
you've experienced in the otherwise comparatively 
<a href="mean.html">upstanding</a> world
of Silicon Valley.  It's as if a chunk of genetic material from the
old-fashioned robber baron business world got incorporated into the
startup world.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The simplest way to protect yourself is to use the trick that John
D. Rockefeller, whose grandfather was an alcoholic, used to protect
himself from becoming one.  He once told a Sunday school class
<blockquote>
  Boys, do you know why I never became a drunkard?  Because I never
  took the first drink.
</blockquote>
Do you want to sell your company right now?  Not eventually, right
now.  If not, just don't take the first meeting.  They won't be
offended.  And you in turn will be guaranteed to be spared one of
the worst experiences that can happen to a startup.<br><br>If you do want to sell, there's another set of 
<a href="https://justinkan.com/the-founders-guide-to-selling-your-company-a1b2025c9481">techniques
</a> for doing
that.  But the biggest mistake founders make in dealing with corp
dev is not doing a bad job of talking to them when they're ready
to, but talking to them before they are.  So if you remember only
the title of this essay, you already know most of what you need to
know about M&amp;A in the first year.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I'm not saying you should never sell.  I'm saying you should
be clear in your own mind about whether you want to sell or not,
and not be led by manipulation or wishful thinking into trying to
sell earlier than you otherwise would have.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In a startup, as in most competitive sports, the task at hand
almost does this for you; you're too busy to feel tired.  But when
you lose that protection, e.g. at the final whistle, the fatigue
hits you like a wave.  To talk to corp dev is to let yourself feel
it mid-game.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
To be fair, the apparent misdeeds of corp dev people are magnified
by the fact that they function as the face of a large organization
that often doesn't know its own mind.  Acquirers can be surprisingly
indecisive about acquisitions, and their flakiness is indistinguishable
from dishonesty by the time it filters down to you.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Marc Andreessen, Jessica Livingston, Geoff

grew up in the small Welsh seacoast town of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rkzUm">Pwllheli</a>.  As we retraced
his walk to school on Google Street View, he said that it had been
nice growing up in the country.<br><br>"Didn't it get boring when you got to be about 15?" I asked.<br><br>"No," he said, "by then I was interested in maths."<br><br>In another conversation he told me that what he really liked was
solving problems.  To me the exercises at the end of each chapter
in a math textbook represent work, or at best a way to reinforce
what you learned in that chapter.  To him the problems were the
reward.  The text of each chapter was just some advice about solving
them. He said that as soon as he got a new textbook he'd immediately
work out all the problems — to the slight annoyance of his teacher,
since the class was supposed to work through the book gradually.<br><br>Few people know so early or so certainly what they want to work on.
But talking to my father reminded me of a heuristic the rest of us
can use. If something that seems like work to other people doesn't
seem like work to you, that's something you're well suited for.
For example, a lot of programmers I know, including me, actually
like debugging.  It's not something people tend to volunteer; one
likes it the way one likes popping zits. But you may have to like
debugging to like programming, considering the degree to which
programming consists of it.<br><br>The stranger your tastes seem to other people, the stronger evidence
they probably are of what you should do. When I was in college I
used to write papers for my friends.  It was quite interesting to
write a paper for a class I wasn't taking.  Plus they were always
so relieved.<br><br>It seemed curious that the same task could be painful to one person
and pleasant to another, but I didn't realize at the time what this
imbalance implied, because I wasn't looking for it.  I didn't realize
how hard it can be to decide what you should work on, and that you
sometimes have to <a href="love.html">figure it out</a> from subtle clues, like a detective
solving a case in a mystery novel.  So I bet it would help a lot
of people to ask themselves about this explicitly. What seems like
work to other people that doesn't seem like work to you?<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Ron Conway.  He knows what happened in every deal in the Valley,
half the time because he arranged it.<br><br>And yet he's a super nice guy.  In fact, nice is not the word.
Ronco is good. I know of zero instances in which he has behaved
badly.  It's hard even to imagine.<br><br>When I first came to Silicon Valley I thought "How lucky that someone
so powerful is so benevolent."  But gradually I realized it wasn't
luck.  It was by being benevolent that Ronco became so powerful.
All the deals he gets to invest in come to him through referrals.
Google did. Facebook did. Twitter was a referral from Evan Williams
himself.  And the reason so many people refer deals to him is that
he's proven himself to be a good guy.<br><br>Good does not mean being a pushover.  I would not want to face an
angry Ronco.  But if Ron's angry at you, it's because you did
something wrong.  Ron is so old school he's Old Testament.  He will
smite you in his just wrath, but there's no malice in it.<br><br>In almost every domain there are advantages to seeming good.  It
makes people trust you.  But actually being good is an expensive
way to seem good.  To an amoral person it might seem to be overkill.<br><br>In some fields it might be, but apparently not in the startup world.
Though plenty of investors are jerks, there is a clear trend among
them: the most successful investors are also the most upstanding. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>It was not always this way.  I would not feel confident saying that
about investors twenty years ago.<br><br>What changed?  The startup world became more transparent and more
unpredictable.  Both make it harder to seem good without actually
being good.<br><br>It's obvious why transparency has that effect.  When an investor
maltreats a founder now, it gets out.  Maybe not all the way to the
press, but other founders hear about it, and that investor
starts to lose deals. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The effect of unpredictability is more subtle.  It increases the
work of being inconsistent.  If you're going to be two-faced, you
have to know who you should be nice to and who you can get away
with being nasty to.  In the startup world, things change so rapidly
that you can't tell.  The random college kid you talk to today might
in a couple years be the CEO of the hottest startup in the Valley.
If you can't tell who to be nice to, you have to be nice to everyone.
And probably the only people who can manage that are the people who
are genuinely good.<br><br>In a sufficiently connected and unpredictable world, you can't seem
good without being good.<br><br>As often happens, Ron discovered how to be the investor of the
future by accident.  He didn't foresee the future of startup
investing, realize it would pay to be upstanding, and force himself
to behave that way. It would feel unnatural to him to behave any
other way.  He was already 
<a href="startupideas.html">living in the future</a>.<br><br>Fortunately that future is not limited to the startup world.  The
startup world is more transparent and unpredictable than most, but
almost everywhere the trend is in that direction.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I'm not saying that if you sort investors by benevolence
you've also sorted them by returns, but rather that if you do a
scatterplot with benevolence on the x axis and returns on the y,
you'd see a clear upward trend.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Y Combinator in particular, because it aggregates data
from so many startups, has a pretty comprehensive view of
investor behavior.<br><br>

understand startups is to look at the most successful companies and
explain why they were not as lame as they seemed when they first
launched.  Because they practically all seemed lame at first. Not
just small, lame.  Not just the first step up a big mountain.  More
like the first step into a swamp.<br><br>A Basic interpreter for the Altair?  How could that ever grow into
a giant company?  People sleeping on airbeds in strangers' apartments?
A web site for college students to stalk one another?  A wimpy
little single-board computer for hobbyists that used a TV as a
monitor?  A new search engine, when there were already about 10,
and they were all trying to de-emphasize search?  These ideas didn't
just seem small.  They seemed wrong.  They were the kind of ideas
you could not merely ignore, but ridicule.<br><br>Often the founders themselves didn't know why their ideas were
promising.  They were attracted to these ideas by instinct, because
they were <a href="startupideas.html">living in the future</a> and
they sensed that something was missing.  But they could not have
put into words exactly how their ugly ducklings were going to grow
into big, beautiful swans.<br><br>Most people's first impulse when they hear about a lame-sounding
new startup idea is to make fun of it.  Even a lot of people who
should know better.<br><br>When I encounter a startup with a lame-sounding idea, I ask "What
Microsoft is this the Altair Basic of?"  Now it's a puzzle, and the
burden is on me to solve it.  Sometimes I can't think of an answer,
especially when the idea is a made-up one.  But it's remarkable how
often there does turn out to be an answer.  Often it's one the
founders themselves hadn't seen yet.<br><br>Intriguingly, there are sometimes multiple answers.  I talked to a
startup a few days ago that could grow into 3 distinct Microsofts.
They'd probably vary in size by orders of magnitude.  But you can
never predict how big a Microsoft is going to be, so in cases like
that I encourage founders to follow whichever path is most immediately
exciting to them.  Their instincts got them this far. Why stop now?<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

should probably change your name.<br><br>The reason is not just that people can't find you.  For companies
with mobile apps, especially, having the right domain name is not
as critical as it used to be for getting users.  The problem with
not having the .com of your name is that it signals weakness.  Unless
you're so big that your reputation precedes you, a marginal domain
suggests you're a marginal company.  Whereas
(as <xa href="http://stripe.com">Stripe shows)
having x.com signals strength even if it has no relation to what you
do.<br><br>Even good founders can be in denial about this.  Their denial derives
from two very powerful forces: identity, and lack of imagination.<br><br>X is what we <i>are</i>, founders think. There's no other name as good.
Both of which are false.<br><br>You can fix the first by stepping back from the problem. Imagine
you'd called your company something else.  If you had, surely you'd
be just as attached to that name as you are to your current one.
The idea of switching to your current name would seem repellent.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>There's nothing intrinsically great about your current name.  Nearly
all your attachment to it comes from it being attached to you.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The way to neutralize the second source of denial, your inability
to think of other potential names, is to acknowledge that you're
bad at naming.  Naming is a completely separate skill from those
you need to be a good founder.  You can be a great startup founder
but hopeless at thinking of names for your company.<br><br>Once you acknowledge that, you stop believing there is nothing else
you could be called.  There are lots of other potential names that
are as good or better; you just can't think of them.<br><br>How do you find them? One answer is the default way to solve
problems you're bad at: find someone else who can think of names.
But with company names there is another possible
approach.  It turns out almost any word or word pair that is not
an obviously bad name is a sufficiently good one, and the number
of such domains is so large that you can find plenty that are cheap
or even untaken.  So make a list and try to buy some.  That's what
<a href="http://www.quora.com/How-did-Stripe-come-up-with-its-name?share=1">Stripe</a> 
did.  (Their search also turned up parse.com, which their
friends at Parse took.)<br><br>The reason I know that naming companies is a distinct skill orthogonal
to the others you need in a startup is that I happen to have it.
Back when I was running YC and did more office hours with startups,
I would often help them find new names.  80% of the time we could
find at least one good name in a 20 minute office hour slot.<br><br>Now when I do office hours I have to focus on more important
questions, like what the company is doing.  I tell them when they
need to change their name.  But I know the power of the forces that
have them in their grip, so I know most won't listen. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>There are of course examples of startups that have succeeded without
having the .com of their name.  There are startups that have succeeded despite any
number of different mistakes.  But this mistake is less excusable
than most.  It's something that can be fixed in a couple days if
you have sufficient discipline to acknowledge the problem.<br><br>100% of the top 20 YC companies by valuation have the .com of their
name. 94% of the top 50 do. But only 66% of companies in the current
batch have the .com of their name. Which suggests there are lessons
ahead for most of the rest, one way or another.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Incidentally, this thought experiment works for
<a href="identity.html">nationality and religion</a> too.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
The liking you have for a name that has become part of your
identity manifests itself not directly, which would be easy to
discount, but as a collection of specious beliefs about its intrinsic
qualities.  (This too is true of nationality and religion as well.)<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Sometimes founders know it's a problem that they don't have
the .com of their name, but delusion strikes a step later in the belief that they'll
be able to buy it despite having no evidence it's for sale.  Don't
believe a domain is for sale unless the owner has already told you
an asking price.<br><br>

something important: why it's safe for startup founders to be nice
people.<br><br>I grew up with a cartoon idea of a very successful businessman (in
the cartoon it was always a man): a rapacious, cigar-smoking,
table-thumping guy in his fifties who wins by exercising power, and
isn't too fussy about how.  As I've <xa href="mean.html">written before, one of
the things that has surprised me most about startups is 
<a href="mean.html">how few</a> of
the most successful founders are like that.  Maybe successful people
in other industries are; I don't know; but not startup founders.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>I knew this empirically, but I never saw the math of why till I got
this founder's email.  In it he said he worried that he was
fundamentally soft-hearted and tended to give away too much for
free. He thought perhaps he needed "a little dose of sociopath-ness."<br><br>I told him not to worry about it, because so long as he built
something good enough to spread by word of mouth, he'd have a
superlinear growth curve.  If he was bad at extracting money from
people, at worst this curve would be some constant multiple less
than 1 of what it might have been.  But a constant multiple of any
curve is exactly the same shape.  The numbers on the Y axis are
smaller, but the curve is just as steep, and when anything grows
at the rate of a successful startup, the Y axis will take care of
itself.<br><br>Some examples will make this clear.  Suppose your company is making
$1000 a month now, and you've made something so great that it's
growing at 5% a week.  Two years from now, you'll be making about
$160k a month.<br><br>Now suppose you're so un-rapacious that you only extract half as
much from your users as you could.  That means two years later
you'll be making $80k a month instead of $160k.  How far behind are
you? How long will it take to catch up with where you'd have been
if you were extracting every penny?  A mere 15 weeks.  After two
years, the un-rapacious founder is only 3.5 months behind the
rapacious one. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you're going to optimize a number, the one to choose is your
<a href="growth.html">growth rate</a>. Suppose as before that you only extract half as much
from users as you could, but that you're able to grow 6% a week
instead of 5%.  Now how are you doing compared to the rapacious
founder after two years?  You're already ahead—$214k a month
versus $160k—and pulling away fast.  In another year you'll be
making $4.4 million a month to the rapacious founder's $2 million.<br><br>Obviously one case where it would help to be rapacious is when
growth depends on that.  What makes startups different is that
usually it doesn't. Startups usually win by making something so
great that people recommend it to their friends.  And being rapacious
not only doesn't help you do that, but probably hurts.  
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The reason startup founders can safely be nice is that making great
things is compounded, and rapacity isn't.<br><br>So if you're a founder, here's a deal you can make with yourself
that will both make you happy and make your company successful.
Tell yourself you can be as nice as you want, so long as you work
hard on your growth rate to compensate.  Most successful startups
make that tradeoff unconsciously. Maybe if you do it consciously
you'll do it even better.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Many think successful startup founders are driven by money.
In fact the secret weapon of the most successful founders is that
they aren't.  If they were, they'd have taken one of the acquisition
offers that every fast-growing startup gets on the way up.  What
drives the most successful founders is the same thing that drives
most people who make things: the company is their project.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In fact since 2 ≈ 1.05 ^ 15, the un-rapacious founder is
always 15 weeks behind the rapacious one.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The other reason it might help to be good at squeezing money
out of customers is that startups usually lose money at first, and
making more per customer makes it easier to get to profitability
before your initial funding runs out.  But while it is very common
for startups to <a href="pinch.html">die</a>
from running through their initial funding and then being unable
to raise more, the underlying cause is usually slow growth or
excessive spending rather than insufficient effort to extract money
from existing customers.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Harj Taggar, Jessica Livingston, and

9 months, the first thing I want to know is almost always the same.
Assuming their expenses remain constant and their revenue growth
is what it has been over the last several months, do they make it to
profitability on the money they have left?  Or to put it more
dramatically, by default do they live or die?<br><br>The startling thing is how often the founders themselves don't know.
Half the founders I talk to don't know whether they're default alive
or default dead.<br><br>If you're among that number, Trevor Blackwell has made a handy
<a href="http://growth.tlb.org/#"><u>calculator</u></a> you can use to find out.<br><br>The reason I want to know first whether a startup is default alive
or default dead is that the rest of the conversation depends on the
answer.  If the company is default alive, we can talk about ambitious
new things they could do.  If it's default dead, we probably need
to talk about how to save it.  We know the current trajectory ends
badly.  How can they get off that trajectory?<br><br>Why do so few founders know whether they're default alive or default
dead?  Mainly, I think, because they're not used to asking that.
It's not a question that makes sense to ask early on, any more than
it makes sense to ask a 3 year old how he plans to support
himself.  But as the company grows older, the question switches from
meaningless to critical.  That kind of switch often takes people
by surprise.<br><br>I propose the following solution: instead of starting to ask too
late whether you're default alive or default dead, start asking too
early.  It's hard to say precisely when the question switches
polarity.  But it's probably not that dangerous to start worrying
too early that you're default dead, whereas it's very dangerous to
start worrying too late.<br><br>The reason is a phenomenon I wrote about earlier: the
<a href="pinch.html">fatal pinch</a>.
The fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enough
time to fix it.  And the way founders end up in it is by not realizing
that's where they're headed.<br><br>There is another reason founders don't ask themselves whether they're
default alive or default dead: they assume it will be easy to raise
more money.  But that assumption is often false, and worse still, the
more you depend on it, the falser it becomes.<br><br>Maybe it will help to separate facts from hopes. Instead of thinking
of the future with vague optimism, explicitly separate the components.
Say "We're default dead, but we're counting on investors to save
us." Maybe as you say that, it will set off the same alarms in your
head that it does in mine.  And if you set off the alarms sufficiently
early, you may be able to avoid the fatal pinch.<br><br>It would be safe to be default dead if you could count on investors
saving you.  As a rule their interest is a function of
growth.  If you have steep revenue growth, say over 5x a year, you
can start to count on investors being interested even if you're not
profitable.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
But investors are so fickle that you can never
do more than start to count on them.  Sometimes something about your
business will spook investors even if your growth is great.  So no
matter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising
as more than a plan A. You should always have a plan B as well: you
should know (as in write down) precisely what you'll need to do to
survive if you can't raise more money, and precisely when you'll 
have to switch to plan B if plan A isn't working.<br><br>In any case, growing fast versus operating cheaply is far from the
sharp dichotomy many founders assume it to be.  In practice there
is surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spends
and how fast it grows.  When a startup grows fast, it's usually
because the product hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some big
need straight on.  When a startup spends a lot, it's usually because
the product is expensive to develop or sell, or simply because
they're wasteful.<br><br>If you're paying attention, you'll be asking at this point not just
how to avoid the fatal pinch, but how to avoid being default dead.
That one is easy: don't hire too fast.  Hiring too fast is by far
the biggest killer of startups that raise money.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Founders tell themselves they need to hire in order to grow.  But
most err on the side of overestimating this need rather than
underestimating it.  Why?  Partly because there's so much work to
do.  Naive founders think that if they can just hire enough
people, it will all get done.  Partly because successful startups have
lots of employees, so it seems like that's what one does in order
to be successful.  In fact the large staffs of successful startups
are probably more the effect of growth than the cause.  And
partly because when founders have slow growth they don't want to
face what is usually the real reason: the product is not appealing
enough.<br><br>Plus founders who've just raised money are often encouraged to
overhire by the VCs who funded them.  Kill-or-cure strategies are
optimal for VCs because they're protected by the portfolio effect.
VCs want to blow you up, in one sense of the phrase or the other.
But as a founder your incentives are different.  You want above all
to survive.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Here's a common way startups die.  They make something moderately
appealing and have decent initial growth. They raise their first
round fairly easily, because the founders seem smart and the idea
sounds plausible. But because the product is only moderately
appealing, growth is ok but not great.  The founders convince
themselves that hiring a bunch of people is the way to boost growth.
Their investors agree.  But (because the product is only moderately
appealing) the growth never comes.  Now they're rapidly running out
of runway.  They hope further investment will save them. But because
they have high expenses and slow growth, they're now unappealing
to investors. They're unable to raise more, and the company dies.<br><br>What the company should have done is address the fundamental problem:
that the product is only moderately appealing.  Hiring people is
rarely the way to fix that.  More often than not it makes it harder.
At this early stage, the product needs to evolve more than to be
"built out," and that's usually easier with fewer people.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Asking whether you're default alive or default dead may save you
from this.  Maybe the alarm bells it sets off will counteract the
forces that push you to overhire.  Instead you'll be compelled to
seek growth in other ways. For example, by <a href="ds.html"><u>doing
things that don't scale</u></a>, or by redesigning the product in the
way only founders can.
And for many if not most startups, these paths to growth will be
the ones that actually work.<br><br>Airbnb waited 4 months after raising money at the end of Y&nbsp;Combinator
before they hired their first employee.  In the meantime the founders
were terribly overworked.  But they were overworked evolving Airbnb
into the astonishingly successful organism it is now.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Steep usage growth will also interest investors.  Revenue
will ultimately be a constant multiple of usage, so x% usage growth
predicts x% revenue growth.  But in practice investors discount
merely predicted revenue, so if you're measuring usage you need a
higher growth rate to impress investors.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Startups that don't raise money are saved from hiring too
fast because they can't afford to. But that doesn't mean you should
avoid raising money in order to avoid this problem, any more than
that total abstinence is the only way to avoid becoming an alcoholic.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
I would not be surprised if VCs' tendency to push founders
to overhire is not even in their own interest.  They don't know how
many of the companies that get killed by overspending might have
done well if they'd survived.  My guess is a significant number.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
After reading a draft, Sam Altman wrote:<br><br>"I think you should make the hiring point more strongly.  I think
it's roughly correct to say that YC's most successful companies
have never been the fastest to hire, and one of the marks of a great
founder is being able to resist this urge."<br><br>Paul Buchheit adds:<br><br>"A related problem that I see a lot is premature scaling—founders
take a small business that isn't really working (bad unit economics,
typically) and then scale it up because they want impressive growth
numbers. This is similar to over-hiring in that it makes the business
much harder to fix once it's big, plus they are bleeding cash really
fast."<br><br>

write: write in spoken language.<br><br>Something comes over most people when they start writing. They write
in a different language than they'd use if they were talking to a
friend. The sentence structure and even the words are different.
No one uses "pen" as a verb in spoken English. You'd feel like an
idiot using "pen" instead of "write" in a conversation with a friend.<br><br>The last straw for me was a sentence I read a couple days ago:
<blockquote>
  The mercurial Spaniard himself declared: "After Altamira, all is
  decadence."
</blockquote>
It's from Neil Oliver's <i>A History of Ancient Britain</i>. I feel bad
making an example of this book, because it's no worse than lots of
others.  But just imagine calling Picasso "the mercurial Spaniard" when
talking to a friend.  Even one
sentence of this would raise eyebrows in conversation.  And yet
people write whole books of it.<br><br>Ok, so written and spoken language are different. Does that make
written language worse?<br><br>If you want people to read and understand what you write, yes.
Written language is more complex, which makes it more work to read.
It's also more formal and distant, which gives the reader's attention
permission to drift.  But perhaps worst of all, the complex sentences
and fancy words give you, the writer, the false impression that
you're saying more than you actually are.<br><br>You don't need complex sentences to express complex ideas.  When
specialists in some abstruse topic talk to one another about ideas
in their field, they don't use sentences any more complex than they
do when talking about what to have for lunch.  They use different
words, certainly.  But even those they use no more than necessary.
And in my experience, the harder the subject, the more informally
experts speak. Partly, I think, because they have less to prove,
and partly because the harder the ideas you're talking about, the
less you can afford to let language get in the way.<br><br>Informal language is the athletic clothing of ideas.<br><br>I'm not saying spoken language always works best. Poetry is as much
music as text, so you can say things you wouldn't say in conversation.
And there are a handful of writers who can get away with using fancy
language in prose. And then of course there are cases where writers
don't want to make it easy to understand what they're saying—in
corporate announcements of bad news, for example, or at the more
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=1,5&amp;q=transgression+narrative+postmodern+gender"><u>bogus</u></a> end of the humanities.  But for nearly everyone else, spoken
language is better.<br><br>It seems to be hard for most people to write in spoken language.
So perhaps the best solution is to write your first draft the way
you usually would, then afterward look at each sentence and ask "Is
this the way I'd say this if I were talking to a friend?" If it
isn't, imagine what you would say, and use that instead.  After a
while this filter will start to operate as you write. When you write
something you wouldn't say, you'll hear the clank as it hits the
page.<br><br>Before I publish a new essay, I read it out loud and fix everything
that doesn't sound like conversation. I even fix bits that are
phonetically awkward; I don't know if that's necessary, but it
doesn't cost much.<br><br>This trick may not always be enough.  I've seen writing so far
removed from spoken language that it couldn't be fixed sentence by
sentence.  For cases like that there's a more drastic solution.
After writing the first draft, try explaining to a friend what you
just wrote. Then replace the draft with what you said to your friend.<br><br>People often tell me how much my essays sound like me talking.
The fact that this seems worthy of comment shows how rarely people
manage to write in spoken language.  Otherwise everyone's writing
would sound like them talking.<br><br>If you simply manage to write in spoken language, you'll be ahead
of 95% of writers.  And it's so easy to do: just don't let a sentence
through unless it's the way you'd say it to a friend.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Patrick Collison and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://note.com/tokyojack/n/n9a13ac4cd47d">Japanese Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://tldrarabiccontents.blogspot.com/2020/01/blog-post_30.html">Arabic Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

it's possible to detect bias in a selection process without knowing
anything about the applicant pool.  Which is exciting because among
other things it means third parties can use this technique to detect
bias whether those doing the selecting want them to or not.<br><br>You can use this technique whenever (a) you have at least
a random sample of the applicants that were selected, (b) their
subsequent performance is measured, and (c) the groups of
applicants you're comparing have roughly equal distribution of ability.<br><br>How does it work?  Think about what it means to be biased.  What
it means for a selection process to be biased against applicants
of type x is that it's harder for them to make it through.  Which
means applicants of type x have to be better to get selected than
applicants not of type x.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font>
Which means applicants of type x
who do make it through the selection process will outperform other
successful applicants.  And if the performance of all the successful
applicants is measured, you'll know if they do.<br><br>Of course, the test you use to measure performance must be a valid
one.  And in particular it must not be invalidated by the bias you're
trying to measure.
But there are some domains where performance can be measured, and
in those detecting bias is straightforward. Want to know if the
selection process was biased against some type of applicant?  Check
whether they outperform the others.  This is not just a heuristic
for detecting bias.  It's what bias means.<br><br>For example, many suspect that venture capital firms are biased
against female founders. This would be easy to detect: among their
portfolio companies, do startups with female founders outperform
those without?  A couple months ago, one VC firm (almost certainly
unintentionally) published a study showing bias of this type. First
Round Capital found that among its portfolio companies, startups
with female founders <a href="http://10years.firstround.com/#one"><u>outperformed</u></a>
those without by 63%. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The reason I began by saying that this technique would come as a
surprise to many people is that we so rarely see analyses of this
type.  I'm sure it will come as a surprise to First Round that they
performed one. I doubt anyone there realized that by limiting their
sample to their own portfolio, they were producing a study not of
startup trends but of their own biases when selecting companies.<br><br>I predict we'll see this technique used more in the future.  The
information needed to conduct such studies is increasingly available.
Data about who applies for things is usually closely guarded by the
organizations selecting them, but nowadays data about who gets
selected is often publicly available to anyone who takes the trouble
to aggregate it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This technique wouldn't work if the selection process looked
for different things from different types of applicants—for
example, if an employer hired men based on their ability but women
based on their appearance.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
As Paul Buchheit points out, First Round excluded their most 
successful investment, Uber, from the study.  And while it 
makes sense to exclude outliers from some types of studies, 
studies of returns from startup investing, which is all about 
hitting outliers, are not one of them.<br><br>

it had been a "one-man show."  It's sadly common to read that sort
of thing.  But the problem with that description is not just that
it's unfair.  It's also misleading.  Much of what's most novel about
YC is due to Jessica Livingston.  If you don't understand her, you
don't understand YC.  So let me tell you a little about Jessica.<br><br>YC had 4 founders.  Jessica and I decided one night to start it,
and the next day we recruited my friends Robert Morris and Trevor
Blackwell.  Jessica and I ran YC day to day, and Robert and Trevor
read applications and did interviews with us.<br><br>Jessica and I were already dating when we started YC.  At first we
tried to act "professional" about this, meaning we tried to conceal
it.  In retrospect that seems ridiculous, and we soon dropped the
pretense.  And the fact that Jessica and I were a couple is a big
part of what made YC what it was.  YC felt like a family.  The
founders early on were mostly young.  We all had dinner together
once a week, cooked for the first couple years by me. Our first
building had been a private home.  The overall atmosphere was
shockingly different from a VC's office on Sand Hill Road, in a way
that was entirely for the better.  There was an authenticity that
everyone who walked in could sense.  And that didn't just mean that
people trusted us.  It was the perfect quality to instill in startups.
Authenticity is one of the most important things YC looks for in
founders, not just because fakers and opportunists are annoying,
but because authenticity is one of the main things that separates
the most successful startups from the rest.<br><br>Early YC was a family, and Jessica was its mom.  And the culture
she defined was one of YC's most important innovations.  Culture
is important in any organization, but at YC culture wasn't just how
we behaved when we built the product. At YC, the culture was the
product.<br><br>Jessica was also the mom in another sense: she had the last word.
Everything we did as an organization went through her <nobr>first — who</nobr>
to fund, what to say to the public, how to deal with other companies,
who to hire, everything.<br><br>Before we had kids, YC was more or less our life. There was no real
distinction between working hours and not.  We talked about YC all
the time.  And while there might be some businesses that it would
be tedious to let infect your private life, we liked it. We'd started
YC because it was something we were interested in.  And some of the
problems we were trying to solve were endlessly difficult.  How do
you recognize good founders?  You could talk about that for years,
and we did; we still do.<br><br>I'm better at some things than Jessica, and she's better at some
things than me.  One of the things she's best at is judging people.
She's one of those rare individuals with x-ray vision for character.
She can see through any kind of faker almost immediately.  Her
nickname within YC was the Social Radar, and this special power of
hers was critical in making YC what it is.  The earlier you pick
startups, the more you're picking the founders.  Later stage investors
get to try products and look at growth numbers.  At the stage where
YC invests, there is often neither a product nor any numbers.<br><br>Others thought YC had some special insight about the future of
technology.  Mostly we had the same sort of insight Socrates claimed:
we at least knew we knew nothing.  What made YC successful was being
able to pick good founders.  We thought Airbnb was a bad idea.  We
funded it because we liked the founders.<br><br>During interviews, Robert and Trevor and I would pepper the applicants
with technical questions.  Jessica would mostly watch.  A lot of
the applicants probably read her as some kind of secretary, especially
early on, because she was the one who'd go out and get each new
group and she didn't ask many questions. She was ok with that.  It
was easier for her to watch people if they didn't notice her. But
after the interview, the three of us would turn to Jessica and ask
"What does the Social Radar say?"
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Having the Social Radar at interviews wasn't just how we picked
founders who'd be successful.  It was also how we picked founders
who were good people.  At first we did this because we couldn't
help it.  Imagine what it would feel like to have x-ray vision for
character.  Being around bad people would be intolerable.  So we'd
refuse to fund founders whose characters we had doubts about even
if we thought they'd be successful.<br><br>Though we initially did this out of self-indulgence, it turned out
to be very valuable to YC.  We didn't realize it in the beginning,
but the people we were picking would become the YC alumni network.
And once we picked them, unless they did something really egregious,
they were going to be part of it for life. Some now think YC's
alumni network is its most valuable feature. I personally think
YC's advice is pretty good too, but the alumni network is certainly
among the most valuable features.  The level of trust and helpfulness
is remarkable for a group of such size.  And Jessica is the main
reason why.<br><br>(As we later learned, it probably cost us little to reject people
whose characters we had doubts about, because how good founders are
and how well they do are <a href="mean.html"><u>not orthogonal</u></a>.  If bad founders succeed
at all, they tend to sell early.  The most successful founders are
almost all good.)<br><br>If Jessica was so important to YC, why don't more people realize
it?  Partly because I'm a writer, and writers always get disproportionate
attention.  YC's brand was initially my brand, and our applicants
were people who'd read my essays.  But there is another reason:
Jessica hates attention.  Talking to reporters makes her nervous.
The thought of giving a talk paralyzes her.  She was even uncomfortable
at our wedding, because the bride is always the center of attention.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>It's not just because she's shy that she hates attention, but because
it throws off the Social Radar. She can't be herself. You can't
watch people when everyone is watching you.<br><br>Another reason attention worries her is that she hates bragging.
In anything she does that's publicly visible, her biggest fear
(after the obvious fear that it will be bad) is that it will seem
ostentatious.  She says being too modest is a common problem for
women.  But in her case it goes beyond that.  She has a horror of
ostentation so visceral it's almost a phobia.<br><br>She also hates fighting. She can't do it; she just shuts down.  And
unfortunately there is a good deal of fighting in being the public
face of an organization.<br><br>So although Jessica more than anyone made YC unique, the very
qualities that enabled her to do it mean she tends to get written
out of YC's history.  Everyone buys this story that PG started YC
and his wife just kind of helped.  Even YC's haters buy it.  A
couple years ago when people were attacking us for not funding more
female founders (than exist), they all treated YC as identical with
PG.  It would have spoiled the narrative to acknowledge Jessica's
central role at YC.<br><br>Jessica was boiling mad that people were accusing <i>her</i> company of
sexism. I've never seen her angrier about anything.  But she did
not contradict them.  Not publicly.  In private there was a great
deal of profanity.  And she wrote three separate essays about the
question of female founders.  But she could never bring herself to
publish any of them.  She'd seen the level of vitriol in this debate,
and she shrank from engaging.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>It wasn't just because she disliked fighting.  She's so sensitive
to character that it repels her even to fight with dishonest people.
The idea of mixing it up with linkbait journalists or Twitter trolls
would seem to her not merely frightening, but disgusting.<br><br>But Jessica knew her example as a successful female founder would
encourage more women to start companies, so last year she did
something YC had never done before and hired a PR firm to get her
some interviews.  At one of the first she did, the reporter brushed
aside her insights about startups and turned it into a sensationalistic
story about how some guy had tried to chat her up as she was waiting
outside the bar where they had arranged to meet.  Jessica was
mortified, partly because the guy had done nothing wrong, but more
because the story treated her as a victim significant only for being
a woman, rather than one of the most knowledgeable investors in the
Valley.<br><br>After that she told the PR firm to stop.<br><br>You're not going to be hearing in the press about what Jessica has
achieved. So let me tell you what Jessica has achieved.  <nobr>Y Combinator</nobr>
is fundamentally a nexus of people, like a university. It doesn't
make a product. What defines it is the people.  Jessica more than
anyone curated and nurtured that collection of people.  In that
sense she literally made YC.<br><br>Jessica knows more about the qualities of startup founders than
anyone else ever has. Her immense data set and x-ray vision are the
perfect storm in that respect.  The qualities of the founders are
the best predictor of how a startup will do.  And startups are in
turn the most important source of growth in mature economies.<br><br>The person who knows the most about the most important factor in
the growth of mature economies — that is who Jessica Livingston is.
Doesn't that sound like someone who should be better known?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Harj Taggar reminded me that while Jessica didn't ask many
questions, they tended to be important ones:<br><br>"She was always good at sniffing out any red flags about the team
or their determination and disarmingly asking the right question,
which usually revealed more than the founders realized."<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Or more precisely, while she likes getting attention in the
sense of getting credit for what she has done, she doesn't like
getting attention in the sense of being watched in real time.
Unfortunately, not just for her but for a lot of people, how much
you get of the former depends a lot on how much you get of the
latter.<br><br>Incidentally, if you saw Jessica at a public event, you would never
guess she
hates attention, because (a) she is very polite and (b) when she's
nervous, she expresses it by smiling more.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The existence of people like Jessica is not just something
the mainstream media needs to learn to acknowledge, but something
feminists need to learn to acknowledge as well.  There are successful
women who don't like to fight.  Which means if the public conversation
about women consists of fighting, their voices will be silenced.<br><br>There's a sort of Gresham's Law of conversations. If a conversation
reaches a certain level of incivility, the more thoughtful people
start to leave. No one understands female founders better than
Jessica.  But it's unlikely anyone will ever hear her speak candidly
about the topic. She ventured a toe in that water a while ago, and
the reaction was so violent that she decided "never again."<br><br>

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><div><div><div></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></div><div><br><br><div><h1 id="re">The Refragmentation</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">January 2016<br><br>One advantage of being old is that you can see change happen in
your lifetime.  A lot of the change I've seen is fragmentation.  US
politics is much more polarized than it used to be.  Culturally we
have ever less common ground. The creative class flocks to a handful
of happy cities, abandoning the rest.  And increasing economic
inequality means the spread between rich and poor is growing too.
I'd like to propose a hypothesis: that all these trends are instances
of the same phenomenon.  And moreover, that the cause is not some
force that's pulling us apart, but rather the erosion of forces
that had been pushing us together.<br><br>Worse still, for those who worry about these trends, the forces
that were pushing us together were an anomaly, a one-time combination
of circumstances that's unlikely to be repeated — and indeed, that
we would not want to repeat.<br><br>The two forces were war (above all World War II), and the rise of
large corporations.<br><br>The effects of World War II were both economic and social.
Economically, it decreased variation in income.  Like all modern
armed forces, America's were socialist economically.  From each
according to his ability, to each according to his need.  More or
less.  Higher ranking members of the military got more (as higher
ranking members of socialist societies always do), but what they
got was fixed according to their rank.  And the flattening effect
wasn't limited to those under arms, because the US economy was
conscripted too.  Between 1942 and 1945 all wages were set by the
National War Labor Board. Like the military, they defaulted to
flatness.  And this national standardization of wages was so pervasive
that its effects could still be seen years after the war ended.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Business owners weren't supposed to be making money either.  FDR
said "not a single war millionaire" would be permitted.  To ensure
that, any increase in a company's profits over prewar levels was
taxed at 85%.  And when what was left after corporate taxes reached
individuals, it was taxed again at a marginal rate of 93%.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Socially too the war tended to decrease variation.  Over 16 million
men and women from all sorts of different backgrounds were brought
together in a way of life that was literally uniform.  Service rates
for men born in the early 1920s approached 80%. And working toward
a common goal, often under stress, brought them still closer together.<br><br>Though strictly speaking World War II lasted less than 4 years for
the US, its effects lasted longer.  Wars make central governments
more powerful, and World War II was an extreme case of this.  In
the US, as in all the other Allied countries, the federal government
was slow to give up the new powers it had acquired.  Indeed, in
some respects the war didn't end in 1945; the enemy just switched
to the Soviet Union.  In tax rates, federal power, defense spending,
conscription, and nationalism, the decades after the war looked more
like wartime than prewar peacetime.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
And the social effects
lasted too.  The kid pulled into the army from behind a mule team
in West Virginia didn't simply go back to the farm afterward.
Something else was waiting for him, something that looked a lot
like the army.<br><br>If total war was the big political story of the 20th century, the
big economic story was the rise of a new kind of company.  And this
too tended to produce both social and economic cohesion.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>The 20th century was the century of the big, national corporation.
General Electric, General Foods, General Motors.  Developments in
finance, communications, transportation, and manufacturing enabled
a new type of company whose goal was above all scale.  Version 1
of this world was low-res: a Duplo world of a few giant companies
dominating each big market.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>The late 19th and early 20th centuries had been a time of consolidation,
led especially by J. P. Morgan.  Thousands of companies run by their
founders were merged into a couple hundred giant ones run by
professional managers. Economies of scale ruled the day.  It seemed
to people at the time that this was the final state of things.  John
D. Rockefeller said in 1880
<blockquote>
  The day of combination is here to stay. Individualism has gone,
  never to return.
</blockquote>
He turned out to be mistaken, but he seemed right for the next
hundred years.<br><br>The consolidation that began in the late 19th century continued for
most of the 20th.  By the end of World War II, as Michael Lind
writes, "the major sectors of the economy were either organized
as government-backed cartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic
corporations."<br><br>For consumers this new world meant the same choices everywhere, but
only a few of them.  When I grew up there were only 2 or 3 of most
things, and since they were all aiming at the middle of the market
there wasn't much to differentiate them.<br><br>One of the most important instances of this phenomenon was in TV.
Here there were 3 choices: NBC, CBS, and ABC. Plus public TV for
eggheads and communists.  The programs that the 3 networks offered were
indistinguishable.  In fact, here there was a triple pressure toward
the center. If one show did try something daring, local affiliates
in conservative markets would make them stop. Plus since TVs were
expensive, whole families watched the same shows together, so they
had to be suitable for everyone.<br><br>And not only did everyone get the same thing, they got it at the
same time.  It's difficult to imagine now, but every night tens of
millions of families would sit down together in front of their TV
set watching the same show, at the same time, as their next door
neighbors.  What happens now with the Super Bowl used to happen
every night. We were literally in sync.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>In a way mid-century TV culture was good. The view it gave of the
world was like you'd find in a children's book, and it probably had
something of the effect that (parents hope) children's books have
in making people behave better.  But, like children's books, TV was
also misleading.  Dangerously misleading, for adults. In his
autobiography, Robert MacNeil talks of seeing gruesome images that
had just come in from Vietnam and thinking, we can't show these to
families while they're having dinner.<br><br>I know how pervasive the common culture was, because I tried to opt
out of it, and it was practically impossible to find alternatives.
When I was 13 I realized, more from internal evidence than any
outside source, that the ideas we were being fed on TV were crap,
and I stopped watching it.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font>
But it wasn't just TV.  It seemed
like everything around me was crap.  The politicians all saying the
same things, the consumer brands making almost identical products
with different labels stuck on to indicate how prestigious they
were meant to be, the balloon-frame houses with fake "colonial"
skins, the cars with several feet of gratuitous metal on each end
that started to fall apart after a couple years, the "red delicious"
apples that were red but only <xa href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/the-evil-reign-of-the-red-delicious/379892/">nominally 
apples. And in retrospect, it <i>was</i> crap.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>But when I went looking for alternatives to fill this void, I found
practically nothing.  There was no Internet then.  The only place
to look was in the chain bookstore in our local shopping mall. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font>
There I found a copy of <i>The Atlantic</i>.  I wish I could say it became
a gateway into a wider world, but in fact I found it boring and
incomprehensible.  Like a kid tasting whisky for the first time and
pretending to like it, I preserved that magazine as carefully as
if it had been a book. I'm sure I still have it somewhere.  But
though it was evidence that there was, somewhere, a world that
wasn't red delicious, I didn't find it till college.<br><br>It wasn't just as consumers that the big companies made us similar.
They did as employers too.  Within companies there were powerful
forces pushing people toward a single model of how to look and act.
IBM was particularly notorious for this, but they were only a little
more extreme than other big companies.  And the models of how to
look and act varied little between companies. Meaning everyone
within this world was expected to seem more or less the same.  And
not just those in the corporate world, but also everyone who aspired
to it — which in the middle of the 20th century meant most people
who weren't already in it.  For most of the 20th century, working-class
people tried hard to look middle class.  You can see it in old
photos.  Few adults aspired to look dangerous in 1950.<br><br>But the rise of national corporations didn't just compress us
culturally.  It compressed us economically too, and on both ends.<br><br>Along with giant national corporations, we got giant national labor
unions.  And in the mid 20th century the corporations cut deals
with the unions where they paid over market price for labor.  Partly
because the unions were monopolies. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font>
Partly because, as
components of oligopolies themselves, the corporations knew they
could safely pass the cost on to their customers, because their
competitors would have to as well.  And partly because in mid-century
most of the giant companies were still focused on finding new ways
to milk economies of scale.  Just as startups rightly pay AWS a
premium over the cost of running their own servers so they can focus
on growth, many of the big national corporations were willing to
pay a premium for labor. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#999999">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>As well as pushing incomes up from the bottom, by overpaying unions,
the big companies of the 20th century also pushed incomes down at
the top, by underpaying their top management. Economist J. K.
Galbraith wrote in 1967 that "There are few corporations in which
it would be suggested that executive salaries are at a maximum."
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#999999">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>To some extent this was an illusion.  Much of the de facto pay of
executives never showed up on their income tax returns, because it
took the form of perks.  The higher the rate of income tax, the
more pressure there was to pay employees upstream of it.  (In the
UK, where taxes were even higher than in the US, companies would
even pay their kids' private school tuitions.)  One of the most
valuable things the big companies of the mid 20th century gave their
employees was job security, and this too didn't show up in tax
returns or income statistics. So the nature of employment in these
organizations tended to yield falsely low numbers about economic
inequality.  But even accounting for that, the big companies paid
their best people less than market price.  There was no market; the
expectation was that you'd work for the same company for decades
if not your whole career. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#999999">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>Your work was so illiquid there was little chance of getting market
price. But that same illiquidity also encouraged you not to seek
it.  If the company promised to employ you till you retired and
give you a pension afterward, you didn't want to extract as much
from it this year as you could. You needed to take care of the
company so it could take care of you.  Especially when you'd been
working with the same group of people for decades.  If you tried
to squeeze the company for more money, you were squeezing the
organization that was going to take care of <i>them</i>.  Plus if
you didn't put the company first you wouldn't be promoted, and if
you couldn't switch ladders, promotion on this one was the only way
up. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#999999">14</font></a>]</font><br><br>To someone who'd spent several formative years in the armed forces,
this situation didn't seem as strange as it does to us now.  From
their point of view, as big company executives, they were high-ranking
officers.  They got paid a lot more than privates.  They got to
have expense account lunches at the best restaurants and fly around
on the company's Gulfstreams.  It probably didn't occur to most of
them to ask if they were being paid market price.<br><br>The ultimate way to get market price is to work for yourself, by
starting your own company.  That seems obvious to any ambitious
person now.  But in the mid 20th century it was an alien concept.
Not because starting one's own company seemed too ambitious, but
because it didn't seem ambitious enough. Even as late as the 1970s,
when I grew up, the ambitious plan was to get lots of education at
prestigious institutions, and then join some other prestigious
institution and work one's way up the hierarchy.  Your prestige was
the prestige of the institution you belonged to.  People did start
their own businesses of course, but educated people rarely did,
because in those days there was practically zero concept of starting
what we now call a <a href="growth.html"><u>startup</u></a>: 
a business that starts small and grows
big.  That was much harder to do in the mid 20th century.  Starting
one's own business meant starting a business that would start small
and stay small. Which in those days of big companies often meant
scurrying around trying to avoid being trampled by elephants.  It
was more prestigious to be one of the executive class riding the
elephant.<br><br>By the 1970s, no one stopped to wonder where the big prestigious
companies had come from in the first place.  It seemed like they'd
always been there, like the chemical elements.  And indeed, there
was a double wall between ambitious kids in the 20th century and
the origins of the big companies.  Many of the big companies were
roll-ups that didn't have clear founders.  And when they did, the
founders didn't seem like us.  Nearly all of them had been uneducated,
in the sense of not having been to college.  They were what Shakespeare
called rude mechanicals.  College trained one to be a member of the
professional classes.  Its graduates didn't expect to do the sort
of grubby menial work that Andrew Carnegie or Henry Ford started
out doing. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#999999">15</font></a>]</font><br><br>And in the 20th century there were more and more college graduates.
They increased from about 2% of the population in 1900 to about 25%
in 2000. In the middle of the century our two big forces intersect,
in the form of the GI Bill, which sent 2.2 million World War II
veterans to college.  Few thought of it in these terms, but the
result of making college the canonical path for the ambitious was
a world in which it was socially acceptable to work for Henry Ford,
but not to be Henry Ford.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#999999">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>I remember this world well. I came of age just as it was starting
to break up. In my childhood it was still dominant. Not quite so
dominant as it had been.  We could see from old TV shows and yearbooks
and the way adults acted that people in the 1950s and 60s had been
even more conformist than us.  The mid-century model was already
starting to get old. But that was not how we saw it at the time.
We would at most have said that one could be a bit more daring in
1975 than 1965.  And indeed, things hadn't changed much yet.<br><br>But change was coming soon. And when the Duplo economy started to
disintegrate, it disintegrated in several different ways at once.
Vertically integrated companies literally dis-integrated because
it was more efficient to.  Incumbents faced new competitors as (a)
markets went global and (b) technical innovation started to trump
economies of scale, turning size from an asset into a liability.
Smaller companies were increasingly able to survive as formerly
narrow channels to consumers broadened.  Markets themselves started
to change faster, as whole new categories of products appeared. And
last but not least, the federal government, which had previously
smiled upon J. P. Morgan's world as the natural state of things,
began to realize it wasn't the last word after all.<br><br>What J. P. Morgan was to the horizontal axis, Henry Ford was to the
vertical.  He wanted to do everything himself. The giant plant he
built at River Rouge between 1917 and 1928 literally took in iron
ore at one end and sent cars out the other.  100,000 people worked
there. At the time it seemed the future. But that is not how car
companies operate today.  Now much of the design and manufacturing
happens in a long supply chain, whose products the car companies
ultimately assemble and sell.  The reason car companies operate
this way is that it works better.  Each company in the supply chain
focuses on what they know best. And they each have to do it well
or they can be swapped out for another supplier.<br><br>Why didn't Henry Ford realize that networks of cooperating companies
work better than a single big company? One reason is that supplier
networks take a while to evolve. In 1917, doing everything himself
seemed to Ford the only way to get the scale he needed. And the
second reason is that if you want to solve a problem using a network
of cooperating companies, you have to be able to coordinate their
efforts, and you can do that much better with computers.  Computers
reduce the transaction costs that Coase argued are the raison d'etre
of corporations. That is a fundamental change.<br><br>In the early 20th century, big companies were synonymous with
efficiency.  In the late 20th century they were synonymous with
inefficiency.  To some extent this was because the companies
themselves had become sclerotic.  But it was also because our
standards were higher.<br><br>It wasn't just within existing industries that change occurred.
The industries themselves changed.  It became possible to make lots
of new things, and sometimes the existing companies weren't the
ones who did it best.<br><br>Microcomputers are a classic example. The market was pioneered by
upstarts like Apple. When it got big enough, IBM decided it was
worth paying attention to.  At the time IBM completely dominated
the computer industry. They assumed that all they had to do, now
that this market was ripe, was to reach out and pick it.  Most
people at the time would have agreed with them.  But what happened
next illustrated how much more complicated the world had become.
IBM did launch a microcomputer.  Though quite successful, it did
not crush Apple.  But even more importantly, IBM itself ended up
being supplanted by a supplier coming in from the side — from
software, which didn't even seem to be the same business.  IBM's
big mistake was to accept a non-exclusive license for DOS.  It must
have seemed a safe move at the time.  No other computer manufacturer
had ever been able to outsell them. What difference did it make if
other manufacturers could offer DOS too?  The result of that
miscalculation was an explosion of inexpensive PC clones.  Microsoft
now owned the PC standard, and the customer.  And the microcomputer
business ended up being Apple vs Microsoft.<br><br>Basically, Apple bumped IBM and then Microsoft stole its wallet.
That sort of thing did not happen to big companies in mid-century.
But it was going to happen increasingly often in the future.<br><br>Change happened mostly by itself in the computer business.  In other
industries, legal obstacles had to be removed first.  Many of the
mid-century oligopolies had been anointed by the federal government
with policies (and in wartime, large orders) that kept out competitors.
This didn't seem as dubious to government officials at the time as
it sounds to us. They felt a two-party system ensured sufficient
competition in politics.  It ought to work for business too.<br><br>Gradually the government realized that anti-competitive policies
were doing more harm than good, and during the Carter administration
it started to remove them. The word used for this process was
misleadingly narrow: deregulation.  What was really happening was
de-oligopolization.  It happened to one industry after another.
Two of the most visible to consumers were air travel and long-distance
phone service, which both became dramatically cheaper after
deregulation.<br><br>Deregulation also contributed to the wave of hostile takeovers in
the 1980s.  In the old days the only limit on the inefficiency of
companies, short of actual bankruptcy, was the inefficiency of their
competitors.  Now companies had to face absolute rather than relative
standards.  Any public company that didn't generate sufficient
returns on its assets risked having its management replaced with
one that would.  Often the new managers did this by breaking companies
up into components that were more valuable separately.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f17n"><font color="#999999">17</font></a>]</font><br><br>Version 1 of the national economy consisted of a few big blocks
whose relationships were negotiated in back rooms by a handful of
executives, politicians, regulators, and labor leaders.  Version 2
was higher resolution: there were more companies, of more different
sizes, making more different things, and their relationships changed
faster. In this world there were still plenty of back room negotiations,
but more was left to market forces.  Which further accelerated the
fragmentation.<br><br>It's a little misleading to talk of versions when describing a
gradual process, but not as misleading as it might seem.  There was
a lot of change in a few decades, and what we ended up with was
qualitatively different.  The companies in the S&amp;P 500 in 1958 had
been there an average of 61 years. By 2012 that number was 18 years.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f18n"><font color="#999999">18</font></a>]</font><br><br>The breakup of the Duplo economy happened simultaneously with the
spread of computing power. To what extent were computers a precondition?
It would take a book to answer that. Obviously the spread of computing
power was a precondition for the rise of startups.  I suspect it
was for most of what happened in finance too.  But was it a
precondition for globalization or the LBO wave?  I don't know, but
I wouldn't discount the possibility.  It may be that the refragmentation
was driven by computers in the way the industrial revolution was
driven by steam engines.  Whether or not computers were a precondition,
they have certainly accelerated it.<br><br>The new fluidity of companies changed people's relationships with
their employers. Why climb a corporate ladder that might be yanked
out from under you?  Ambitious people started to think of a career
less as climbing a single ladder than as a series of jobs that might
be at different companies. More movement (or even potential movement)
between companies introduced more competition in salaries.  Plus
as companies became smaller it became easier to estimate how much
an employee contributed to the company's revenue.  Both changes
drove salaries toward market price. And since people vary dramatically
in productivity, paying market price meant salaries started to
diverge.<br><br>By no coincidence it was in the early 1980s that the term "yuppie"
was coined.  That word is not much used now, because the phenomenon
it describes is so taken for granted, but at the time it was a label
for something novel. Yuppies were young professionals who made lots
of money.  To someone in their twenties today, this wouldn't seem
worth naming.  Why wouldn't young professionals make lots of money?
But until the 1980s, being underpaid early in your career was part
of what it meant to be a professional.  Young professionals were
paying their dues, working their way up the ladder.  The rewards
would come later.  What was novel about yuppies was that they wanted
market price for the work they were doing now.<br><br>The first yuppies did not work for startups. That was still in the
future.  Nor did they work for big companies. They were professionals
working in fields like law, finance, and consulting.  But their example 
rapidly inspired their peers.  Once they saw that new BMW 325i, they 
wanted one too.<br><br>Underpaying people at the beginning of their career only works if
everyone does it. Once some employer breaks ranks, everyone else
has to, or they can't get good people.  And once started this process
spreads through the whole economy, because at the beginnings of
people's careers they can easily switch not merely employers but
industries.<br><br>But not all young professionals benefitted. You had to produce to
get paid a lot.  It was no coincidence that the first yuppies worked
in fields where it was easy to measure that.<br><br>More generally, an idea was returning whose name sounds old-fashioned
precisely because it was so rare for so long: that you could make
your fortune.  As in the past there were multiple ways to do it.
Some made their fortunes by creating wealth, and others by playing
zero-sum games. But once it became possible to make one's fortune,
the ambitious had to decide whether or not to.  A physicist who
chose physics over Wall Street in 1990 was making a sacrifice that
a physicist in 1960 didn't have to think about.<br><br>The idea even flowed back into big companies.  CEOs of big companies
make more now than they used to, and I think much of the reason is
prestige.  In 1960, corporate CEOs had immense prestige.  They were
the winners of the only economic game in town. But if they made as
little now as they did then, in real dollar terms, they'd seem like
small fry compared to professional athletes and whiz kids making
millions from startups and hedge funds. They don't like that idea,
so now they try to get as much as they can, which is more than they
had been getting. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f19n"><font color="#999999">19</font></a>]</font><br><br>Meanwhile a similar fragmentation was happening at the other end
of the economic scale.  As big companies' oligopolies became less
secure, they were less able to pass costs on to customers and thus
less willing to overpay for labor.  And as the Duplo world of a few
big blocks fragmented into many companies of different sizes — some
of them overseas — it became harder for unions to enforce their
monopolies.  As a result workers' wages also tended toward market
price. Which (inevitably, if unions had been doing their job) tended
to be lower.  Perhaps dramatically so, if automation had decreased
the need for some kind of work.<br><br>And just as the mid-century model induced social as well as economic
cohesion, its breakup brought social as well as economic fragmentation.
People started to dress and act differently.  Those who would later
be called the "creative class" became more mobile. People who didn't
care much for religion felt less pressure to go to church for
appearances' sake, while those who liked it a lot opted for
increasingly colorful forms. Some switched from meat loaf to tofu,
and others to Hot Pockets. Some switched from driving Ford sedans
to driving small imported cars, and others to driving SUVs.  Kids
who went to private schools or wished they did started to dress
"preppy," and kids who wanted to seem rebellious made a conscious
effort to look disreputable.  In a hundred ways people spread apart.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f20n"><font color="#999999">20</font></a>]</font><br><br>Almost four decades later, fragmentation is still increasing.  Has
it been net good or bad?  I don't know; the question may be
unanswerable.  Not entirely bad though.  We take for granted the
forms of fragmentation we like, and worry only about the ones we
don't. But as someone who caught the tail end of mid-century
<a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=well-adjusted&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3"><u>conformism</u></a>, 
I can tell you it was no utopia.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f21n"><font color="#999999">21</font></a>]</font><br><br>My goal here is not to say whether fragmentation has been good or
bad, just to explain why it's happening.  With the centripetal
forces of total war and 20th century oligopoly mostly gone, what
will happen next?  And more specifically, is it possible to reverse
some of the fragmentation we've seen?<br><br>If it is, it will have to happen piecemeal.  You can't reproduce
mid-century cohesion the way it was originally produced.  It would
be insane to go to war just to induce more national unity.  And
once you understand the degree to which the economic history of the
20th century was a low-res version 1, it's clear you can't reproduce
that either.<br><br>20th century cohesion was something that happened at least in a
sense naturally.  The war was due mostly to external forces, and
the Duplo economy was an evolutionary phase.  If you want cohesion
now, you'd have to induce it deliberately.  And it's not obvious
how.  I suspect the best we'll be able to do is address the symptoms
of fragmentation.  But that may be enough.<br><br>The form of fragmentation people worry most about lately is <a href="ineq.html"><u>economic inequality</u></a>, and if you want to eliminate
that you're up against a truly formidable headwind that has
been in operation since the stone age. Technology.<br><br>Technology is
a lever. It magnifies work.  And the lever not only grows increasingly
long, but the rate at which it grows is itself increasing.<br><br>Which in turn means the variation in the amount of wealth people
can create has not only been increasing, but accelerating.  The
unusual conditions that prevailed in the mid 20th century masked
this underlying trend.  The ambitious had little choice but to join
large organizations that made them march in step with lots of other
people — literally in the case of the armed forces, figuratively
in the case of big corporations. Even if the big corporations had
wanted to pay people proportionate to their value, they couldn't
have figured out how.  But that constraint has gone now.  Ever since
it started to erode in the 1970s, we've seen the underlying forces
at work again.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f22n"><font color="#999999">22</font></a>]</font><br><br>Not everyone who gets rich now does it by creating wealth, certainly.
But a significant number do, and the Baumol Effect means all their
peers get dragged along too.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f23n"><font color="#999999">23</font></a>]</font>
And as long as it's possible to
get rich by creating wealth, the default tendency will be for
economic inequality to increase.  Even if you eliminate all the
other ways to get rich.  You can mitigate this with subsidies at
the bottom and taxes at the top, but unless taxes are high enough
to discourage people from creating wealth, you're always going to
be fighting a losing battle against increasing variation in
productivity.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f24n"><font color="#999999">24</font></a>]</font><br><br>That form of fragmentation, like the others, is here to stay.  Or
rather, back to stay.  Nothing is forever, but the tendency toward
fragmentation should be more forever than most things, precisely
because it's not due to any particular cause.  It's simply a reversion
to the mean. When Rockefeller said individualism was gone, he was
right for a hundred years.  It's back now, and that's likely to be
true for longer.<br><br>I worry that if we don't acknowledge this, we're headed for trouble.
If we think 20th century cohesion disappeared because of few policy
tweaks, we'll be deluded into thinking we can get it back (minus
the bad parts, somehow) with a few countertweaks.  And then we'll
waste our time trying to eliminate fragmentation, when we'd be
better off thinking about how to mitigate its consequences.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Lester Thurow, writing in 1975, said the wage differentials
prevailing at the end of World War II had become so embedded that
they "were regarded as 'just' even after the egalitarian pressures
of World War II had disappeared.  Basically, the same differentials
exist to this day, thirty years later." But Goldin and Margo think
market forces in the postwar period also helped preserve the wartime
compression of wages — specifically increased demand for unskilled
workers, and oversupply of educated ones.<br><br>(Oddly enough, the American custom of having employers pay for
health insurance derives from efforts by businesses to circumvent
NWLB wage controls in order to attract workers.)<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
As always, tax rates don't tell the whole story.  There were
lots of exemptions, especially for individuals.  And in World War
II the tax codes were so new that the government had little acquired
immunity to tax avoidance.  If the rich paid high taxes during the
war it was more because they wanted to than because they had to.<br><br>After the war, federal tax receipts as a percentage of GDP were
about the same as they are now. In fact, for the entire period since
the war, tax receipts have stayed close to 18% of GDP, despite
dramatic changes in tax rates.  The lowest point occurred when
marginal income tax rates were highest: 14.1% in 1950.  Looking at
the data, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that tax rates have had
little effect on what people actually paid.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Though in fact the decade preceding the war had been a time
of unprecedented federal power, in response to the Depression.
Which is not entirely a coincidence, because the Depression was one
of the causes of the war.  In many ways the New Deal was a sort of
dress rehearsal for the measures the federal government took during
wartime.  The wartime versions were much more drastic and more
pervasive though.  As Anthony Badger wrote, "for many Americans the
decisive change in their experiences came not with the New Deal but
with World War II."<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
I don't know enough about the origins of the world wars to
say, but it's not inconceivable they were connected to the rise of
big corporations. If that were the case, 20th century cohesion would
have a single cause.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
More precisely, there was a bimodal economy consisting, in
Galbraith's words, of "the world of the technically dynamic, massively
capitalized and highly organized corporations on the one hand and
the hundreds of thousands of small and traditional proprietors on
the other." Money, prestige, and power were concentrated in the
former, and there was near zero crossover.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]

Monroeville Mall was at the time of its completion in 1969
the largest in the country. In the late 1970s the movie <i>Dawn of

The relationships between unions and unionized companies can
even be symbiotic, because unions will exert political pressure to
protect their hosts.  According to Michael Lind, when politicians
tried to attack the A&amp;P supermarket chain because it was putting
local grocery stores out of business, "A&amp;P successfully defended
itself by allowing the unionization of its workforce in 1938, thereby
gaining organized labor as a constituency." I've seen this phenomenon
myself: hotel unions are responsible for more of the political
pressure against Airbnb than hotel companies.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
Galbraith was clearly puzzled that corporate executives would
work so hard to make money for other people (the shareholders)
instead of themselves.  He devoted much of <i>The New Industrial
State</i> to trying to figure this out.<br><br>His theory was that professionalism had replaced money as a motive,
and that modern corporate executives were, like (good) scientists,
motivated less by financial rewards than by the desire to do good
work and thereby earn the respect of their peers.  There is something
in this, though I think lack of movement between companies combined
with self-interest explains much of observed behavior.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
Galbraith (p. 94) says a 1952 study of the 800 highest paid

It seems likely that in the first third of the 20th century
executive salaries were low partly because companies then were more
dependent on banks, who would have disapproved if executives got
too much.  This was certainly true in the beginning. The first big
company CEOs were J. P. Morgan's hired hands.<br><br>Companies didn't start to finance themselves with retained earnings
till the 1920s.  Till then they had to pay out their earnings in
dividends, and so depended on banks for capital for expansion.
Bankers continued to sit on corporate boards till the Glass-Steagall
act in 1933.<br><br>By mid-century big companies funded 3/4 of their growth from earnings.
But the early years of bank dependence, reinforced by the financial
controls of World War II, must have had a big effect on social
conventions about executive salaries.  So it may be that the lack
of movement between companies was as much the effect of low salaries
as the cause.<br><br>Incidentally, the switch in the 1920s to financing growth with
retained earnings was one cause of the 1929 crash.  The banks now
had to find someone else to lend to, so they made more margin loans.<br><br>[<a name="f15n"><font color="#000000">15</font></a>]
Even now it's hard to get them to. One of the things I find
hardest to get into the heads of would-be startup founders is how
important it is to do certain kinds of menial work early in the
life of a company.  Doing <a href="ds.html"><u>things that don't
scale</u></a> is to how Henry Ford got started as a high-fiber diet is

Founders weren't celebrated in the press when I was a kid.

The wave of hostile takeovers in the 1980s was enabled by a
combination of circumstances: court decisions striking down state
anti-takeover laws, starting with the Supreme Court's 1982 decision
in Edgar v. MITE Corp.; the Reagan administration's comparatively
sympathetic attitude toward takeovers; the Depository Institutions
Act of 1982, which allowed banks and savings and loans to buy
corporate bonds; a new SEC rule issued in 1982 (rule 415) that made
it possible to bring corporate bonds to market faster; the creation
of the junk bond business by Michael Milken; a vogue for conglomerates
in the preceding period that caused many companies to be combined
that never should have been; a decade of inflation that left many
public companies trading below the value of their assets; and not
least, the increasing complacency of managements.<br><br>[<a name="f18n"><font color="#000000">18</font></a>]

CEOs of big companies may be overpaid. I don't know enough
about big companies to say. But it is certainly not impossible for
a CEO to make 200x as much difference to a company's revenues as
the average employee.  Look at what Steve Jobs did for Apple when
he came back as CEO.  It would have been a good deal for the board
to give him 95% of the company.  Apple's market cap the day Steve
came back in July 1997 was 1.73 billion. 5% of Apple now (January
2016) would be worth about 30 billion.  And it would not be if Steve
hadn't come back; Apple probably wouldn't even exist anymore.<br><br>Merely including Steve in the sample might be enough to answer the
question of whether public company CEOs in the aggregate are overpaid.
And that is not as facile a trick as it might seem, because the
broader your holdings, the more the aggregate is what you care
about.<br><br>[<a name="f20n"><font color="#000000">20</font></a>]

There were a handful of ways to make a fortune in the mid
20th century.  The main one was drilling for oil, which was open
to newcomers because it was not something big companies could
dominate through economies of scale.  How did individuals accumulate
large fortunes in an era of such high taxes?  Giant tax loopholes
defended by two of the most powerful men in Congress, Sam Rayburn
and Lyndon Johnson.<br><br>But becoming a Texas oilman was not in 1950 something one could

I'm not claiming variation in productivity is the only cause
of economic inequality in the US. But it's a significant cause, and
it will become as big a cause as it needs to, in the sense that if
you ban other ways to get rich, people who want to get rich will
use this route instead.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Patrick

<p> -->
January 2016<br><br>Since the 1970s, economic inequality in the US has increased
dramatically. And in particular, the rich have gotten a lot richer.
Nearly everyone who writes about the topic says that economic inequality
should be decreased.<br><br>I'm interested in this question because I was one of the founders of
a company called Y Combinator that helps people start startups.
Almost by definition, if a startup succeeds, its founders become
rich. Which means by helping startup founders I've been helping to
increase economic inequality.  If economic inequality should be 
decreased, I shouldn't be helping founders. No one should
be.<br><br>But that doesn't sound right. What's going on here? What's going
on is that while economic inequality is a single measure (or more
precisely, two: variation in income, and variation in wealth), it
has multiple causes. Many of these causes are bad, like tax loopholes
and drug addiction. But some are good, like Larry Page and
Sergey Brin starting the company you use to find things online.<br><br>If you want to understand economic inequality — and more importantly,
if you actually want to fix the bad aspects of it — you have to
tease apart the components.  And yet the trend in nearly everything
written about the subject is to do the opposite: to squash together
all the aspects of economic inequality as if it were a single
phenomenon.<br><br>Sometimes this is done for ideological reasons.  Sometimes it's
because the writer only has very high-level data and so draws
conclusions from that, like the proverbial drunk who looks for his
keys under the lamppost, instead of where he dropped them, because the
light is better there.  Sometimes it's because the writer doesn't
understand critical aspects of inequality, like the role of technology
in wealth creation.  Much of the time, perhaps most of the time,
writing about economic inequality combines all three.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>The most common mistake people make about economic inequality is
to treat it as a single phenomenon.  The most naive version of which
is the one based on the pie fallacy: that the rich get rich by
taking money from the poor.<br><br>Usually this is an assumption people start from rather than a
conclusion they arrive at by examining the evidence.  Sometimes the
pie fallacy is stated explicitly:
<blockquote>
  ...those at the top are grabbing an increasing fraction of the
  nation's income — so much of a larger share that what's left over
  for the rest is diminished....
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
Other times it's more unconscious. But the unconscious form is very
widespread.  I think because we grow up in a world where the pie
fallacy is actually true.  To kids, wealth <i>is</i> a fixed pie
that's shared out, and if one person gets more, it's at the expense
of another.  It takes a conscious effort to remind oneself that the
real world doesn't work that way.<br><br>In the real world you can create wealth as well as taking it from
others.  A woodworker creates wealth.  He makes a chair, and you
willingly give him money in return for it.  A high-frequency trader
does not.  He makes a dollar only when someone on the other end of
a trade loses a dollar.<br><br>If the rich people in a society got that way by taking wealth from
the poor, then you have the degenerate case of economic inequality,
where the cause of poverty is the same as the cause of wealth.  But
instances of inequality don't have to be instances of the degenerate
case.  If one woodworker makes 5 chairs and another makes none, the
second woodworker will have less money, but not because anyone took
anything from him.<br><br>Even people sophisticated enough to know about the pie fallacy are
led toward it by the custom of describing economic inequality as a
ratio of one quantile's income or wealth to another's.  It's so
easy to slip from talking about income shifting from one quantile
to another, as a figure of speech, into believing that is literally
what's happening.<br><br>Except in the degenerate case, economic inequality can't be described
by a ratio or even a curve.  In the general case it consists of
multiple ways people become poor, and multiple ways people become
rich.  Which means to understand economic inequality in a country,
you have to go find individual people who are poor or rich and
figure out why.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you want to understand <i>change</i> in economic inequality, you
should ask what those people would have done when it was different.
This is one way I know the rich aren't all getting richer simply
from some new system for transferring wealth to them from
everyone else.  When you use the would-have method with startup
founders, you find what most would have done 
<a href="re.html"><u>back in 1960</u></a>, when
economic inequality was lower, was to join big companies or become
professors.  Before Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook, his default
expectation was that he'd end up working at Microsoft.  The reason
he and most other startup founders are richer than they would have
been in the mid 20th century is not because of some right turn the
country took during the Reagan administration, but because progress
in technology has made it much easier to start a new company that
<a href="growth.html"><u>grows fast</u></a>.<br><br>Traditional economists seem strangely averse to studying individual
humans. It seems to be a rule with them that everything has to start
with statistics.  So they give you very precise numbers about
variation in wealth and income, then follow it with the most naive
speculation about the underlying causes.<br><br>But while there are a lot of people who get rich through rent-seeking
of various forms, and a lot who get rich by playing zero-sum games, 
there are also a significant number
who get rich by creating wealth.  And creating wealth, as a source
of economic inequality, is different from taking it — not just
morally, but also practically, in the sense that it is harder to
eradicate.  One reason is that variation in productivity is
accelerating.  The rate at which individuals can create wealth
depends on the technology available to them, and that grows
exponentially. The other reason creating wealth is such a tenacious
source of inequality is that it can expand to accommodate a lot of
people.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>I'm all for shutting down the crooked ways to get rich.  But that
won't eliminate great variations in wealth, because as long as you leave
open the option of getting rich by creating wealth, people who want
to get rich will do that instead.<br><br>Most people who get rich tend to be fairly driven. Whatever their
other flaws, laziness is usually not one of them.  Suppose new
policies make it hard to make a fortune in finance. Does it seem
plausible that the people who currently go into finance to make
their fortunes will continue to do so, but be content to work for
ordinary salaries? The reason they go into finance is not because
they love finance but because they want to get rich. If the only
way left to get rich is to start startups, they'll start startups.
They'll do well at it too, because determination is the main factor
in the success of a startup. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font>
And while it would probably be
a good thing for the world if people who wanted to get rich switched
from playing zero-sum games to creating wealth, that would not only
not eliminate great variations in wealth, but might even 
exacerbate them.
In a zero-sum game there is at least a limit to the upside.  Plus
a lot of the new startups would create new technology that further
accelerated variation in productivity.<br><br>Variation in productivity is far from the only source of economic
inequality, but it is the irreducible core of it, in the sense that
you'll have that left when you eliminate all other sources. And if
you do, that core will be big, because it will have expanded to
include the efforts of all the refugees.  Plus it will have a large
Baumol penumbra around it: anyone who could get rich by creating
wealth on their own account will have to be paid enough to prevent
them from doing it.<br><br>You can't prevent great variations in wealth without preventing people
from getting rich, and you can't do that without preventing them
from starting startups.<br><br>So let's be clear about that. Eliminating great variations in wealth would
mean eliminating startups.  And that doesn't seem a wise move.
Especially since it would only mean you eliminated
startups in your own country.  Ambitious people already move halfway
around the world to further their careers, and startups can operate
from anywhere nowadays.  So if you made it impossible to get rich
by creating wealth in your country, people who wanted to do that
would just leave and do it somewhere else. Which would
certainly get you a lower Gini coefficient, along with a lesson in
being careful what you ask for. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>I think rising economic inequality is the inevitable fate of countries
that don't choose something worse. We had a 40 year stretch in the
middle of the 20th century that convinced some people otherwise.
But as I explained in <a href="re.html"><u>The Refragmentation</u></a>,
that was an anomaly — a
unique combination of circumstances that compressed American society
not just economically but culturally too.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>And while some of the growth in economic inequality we've seen since
then has been due to bad behavior of various kinds, there has
simultaneously been a huge increase in individuals' ability to
create wealth.  Startups are almost entirely a product of this
period. And even within the startup world, there has been a qualitative
change in the last 10 years.  Technology has decreased the cost of
starting a startup so much that founders now have the upper hand
over investors.  Founders get less diluted, and it is now common
for them to retain 
<a href="control.html"><u>board control</u></a> as well.  Both further increase
economic inequality, the former because founders own more stock,
and the latter because, as investors have learned, founders tend
to be better at running their companies than investors.<br><br>While the surface manifestations change, the underlying forces are
very, very old.  The acceleration of productivity we see in Silicon
Valley has been happening for thousands of years.  If you look at
the history of stone tools, technology was already accelerating in
the Mesolithic.  The acceleration would have been too slow to
perceive in one lifetime.  Such is the nature of the leftmost part
of an exponential curve.  But it was the same curve.<br><br>You do not want to design your society in a way that's incompatible
with this curve. The evolution of technology is one of the most
powerful forces in history.<br><br>Louis Brandeis said "We may have democracy, or we may have wealth
concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both." That
sounds plausible.  But if I have to choose between ignoring him and
ignoring an exponential curve that has been operating for thousands
of years, I'll bet on the curve.  Ignoring any trend that has been
operating for thousands of years is dangerous.  But exponential
growth, especially, tends to bite you.<br><br><center>___</center><br><br>If accelerating variation in productivity is always going to produce
some baseline growth in economic inequality, it would be a good
idea to spend some time thinking about that future.  Can you have
a healthy society with great variation in wealth?  What would it
look like?<br><br>Notice how novel it feels to think about that.  The public conversation
so far has been exclusively about the need to decrease economic
inequality.  We've barely given a thought to how to live with it.<br><br>I'm hopeful we'll be able to.  Brandeis was a product of the Gilded
Age, and things have changed since then. It's harder to hide
wrongdoing now.  And to get rich now you don't have to buy politicians
the way railroad or oil magnates did. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#999999">6</font></a>]</font>
The great concentrations
of wealth I see around me in Silicon Valley don't seem to be
destroying democracy.<br><br>There are lots of things wrong with the US that have economic
inequality as a symptom. We should fix those things.  In the process
we may decrease economic inequality. But we can't start from the
symptom and hope to fix the underlying causes.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#999999">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>The most obvious is poverty. I'm sure most of those who want to
decrease economic inequality want to do it mainly to help the poor,
not to hurt the rich. 
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#999999">8</font></a>]</font>
Indeed, a good number are merely being
sloppy by speaking of decreasing economic inequality when what they
mean is decreasing poverty.  But this is a situation where it would
be good to be precise about what we want.  Poverty and economic
inequality are not identical.  When the city is turning off your
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/07/what-happens-when-detroit-shuts-off-the-water-of-100000-people/374548/"><u>water</u></a>
because you can't pay the bill, it doesn't make any difference
what Larry Page's net worth is compared to yours.  He might only
be a few times richer than you, and it would still be just as much
of a problem that your water was getting turned off.<br><br>Closely related to poverty is lack of social mobility.  I've seen
this myself: you don't have to grow up rich or even upper middle
class to get rich as a startup founder, but few successful founders
grew up desperately poor.  But again, the problem here is not simply
economic inequality.  There is an enormous difference in wealth
between the household Larry Page grew up in and that of a successful
startup founder, but that didn't prevent him from joining their
ranks.  It's not economic inequality per se that's blocking social
mobility, but some specific combination of things that go wrong
when kids grow up sufficiently poor.<br><br>One of the most important principles in Silicon Valley is that "you
make what you measure."  It means that if you pick some number to
focus on, it will tend to improve, but that you have to choose the
right number, because only the one you choose will improve; another
that seems conceptually adjacent might not.  For example, if you're
a university president and you decide to focus on graduation rates,
then you'll improve graduation rates.  But only graduation rates,
not how much students learn.  Students could learn less, if to
improve graduation rates you made classes easier.<br><br>Economic inequality is sufficiently far from identical with the
various problems that have it as a symptom that we'll probably only
hit whichever of the two we aim at.  If we aim at economic inequality,
we won't fix these problems.  So I say let's aim at the problems.<br><br>For example, let's attack poverty, and if necessary damage wealth
in the process. That's much more likely to work than attacking
wealth in the hope that you will thereby fix poverty.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#999999">9</font></a>]</font>
And if
there are people getting rich by tricking consumers or lobbying the
government for anti-competitive regulations or tax loopholes, then
let's stop them. Not because it's causing economic inequality, but
because it's stealing.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#999999">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>If all you have is statistics, it seems like that's what you need
to fix. But behind a broad statistical measure like economic
inequality there are some things that are good and some that are
bad, some that are historical trends with immense momentum and
others that are random accidents.  If we want to fix the world
behind the statistics, we have to understand it, and focus our
efforts where they'll do the most good.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Stiglitz, Joseph. <i>The Price of Inequality</i>. Norton, 2012. p.

Particularly since economic inequality is a matter of outliers,
and outliers are disproportionately likely to have gotten where
they are by ways that have little do with the sort of things
economists usually think about, like wages and productivity, but
rather by, say, ending up on the wrong side of the "War on Drugs."<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Determination is the most important factor in deciding between
success and failure, which in startups tend to be sharply differentiated.
But it takes more than determination to create one of the hugely
successful startups.  Though most founders start out excited about
the idea of getting rich, purely mercenary founders will usually
take one of the big acquisition offers most successful startups get
on the way up.  The founders who go on to the next stage tend to
be driven by a sense of mission.  They have the same attachment to
their companies that an artist or writer has to their work.  But
it is very hard to predict at the outset which founders will do
that. It's not simply a function of their initial attitude.  Starting
a company changes people.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
After reading a draft of this essay, Richard Florida told me
how he had once talked to a group of Europeans "who said
 they wanted to make Europe more entrepreneurial and more
  like Silicon Valley. I said by definition this will give you more
  inequality.  They thought I was insane — they could not process
  it."<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Economic inequality has been decreasing globally.  But this
is mainly due to the erosion of the kleptocracies that formerly
dominated all the poorer countries.  Once the playing field is
leveler politically, we'll see economic inequality start to rise
again. The US is the bellwether.  The situation we face here, the
rest of the world will sooner or later.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Some people still get rich by buying politicians.  My point is that
it's no longer a precondition.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
As well as problems that have economic inequality as a symptom,
there are those that have it as a cause.  But in most if not all,
economic inequality is not the primary cause.  There is usually
some injustice that is allowing economic inequality to turn into
other forms of inequality, and that injustice is what we need to
fix.  For example, the police in the US treat the poor worse than
the rich.  But the solution is not to make people richer. It's to
make the police treat people more equitably.  Otherwise they'll
continue to maltreat people who are weak in other ways.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Some who read this essay will say that I'm clueless or even
being deliberately misleading by focusing so much on the richer end
of economic inequality — that economic inequality is really about
poverty. But that is exactly the point I'm making, though sloppier
language than I'd use to make it.  The real problem is poverty, not
economic inequality.  And if you conflate them you're aiming at the
wrong target.<br><br>Others will say I'm clueless or being misleading by focusing on
people who get rich by creating wealth — that startups aren't the
problem, but corrupt practices in finance, healthcare, and so on.
Once again, that is exactly my point.  The problem is not economic
inequality, but those specific abuses.<br><br>It's a strange task to write an essay about why something isn't the
problem, but that's the situation you find yourself in when so many
people mistakenly think it is.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Particularly since many causes of poverty are only partially
driven by people trying to make money from them. For example,
America's abnormally high incarceration rate is a major cause of
poverty.  But although <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/28/how-for-profit-prisons-have-become-the-biggest-lobby-no-one-is-talking-about/"><u>for-profit prison companies</u></a> and 
<a href="http://mic.com/articles/41531/union-of-the-snake-how-california-s-prison-guards-subvert-democracy"><u>prison guard unions</u></a> both spend 
a lot lobbying for harsh sentencing laws, they
are not the original source of them.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
Incidentally, tax loopholes are definitely not a product
of some power shift due to recent increases in economic inequality.
The golden age of economic equality in the mid 20th century was
also the golden age of tax avoidance. Indeed, it was so widespread
and so effective that I'm skeptical whether economic inequality was
really so low then as we think.  In a period when people are trying
to hide wealth from the government, it will tend to be hidden from
statistics too. One sign of the potential magnitude of the problem
is the discrepancy between government receipts as a percentage of
GDP, which have remained more or less constant during the entire
period from the end of World War II to the present, and tax rates,
which have varied dramatically.<br><br>

When I was a kid I used to wonder
about this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining
about its finiteness?  Would we be just as likely to feel life was
short if we lived 10 times as long?<br><br>Since there didn't seem any way to answer this question, I stopped
wondering about it.  Then I had kids.  That gave me a way to answer
the question, and the answer is that life actually is short.<br><br>Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time,
into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year
old.  If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only
get to watch your child experience it 8 times.  And while it's
impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity
like time, 8 is not a lot of something.  If you had a handful of 8
peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would
definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.<br><br>Ok, so life actually is short.  Does it make any difference to know
that?<br><br>It has for me.  It means arguments of the form "Life is too short
for x" have great force.  It's not just a figure of speech to say
that life is too short for something.  It's not just a synonym for
annoying.  If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for
something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.<br><br>When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word
that pops into my head is "bullshit." I realize that answer is
somewhat tautological.  It's almost the definition of bullshit that
it's the stuff that life is too short for.  And yet bullshit does
have a distinctive character.  There's something fake about it.
It's the junk food of experience.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit,
you probably already know the answer.  Unnecessary meetings, pointless
disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's
mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.<br><br>There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's
either forced on you, or it tricks you.  To some extent you have to
put up with the bullshit forced on you by circumstances.  You need
to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands.  Indeed,
the law of supply and demand ensures that: the more rewarding some
kind of work is, the cheaper people will do it.  It may be that
less bullshit is forced on you than you think, though.  There has
always been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and
go live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional
sense, but life feels more authentic.  This could become more common.<br><br>You can do it on a smaller scale without moving.  The amount of
time you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers.  Most
large organizations (and many small ones) are steeped in it.  But
if you consciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factors
like money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will
waste less of your time.<br><br>If you're a freelancer or a small company, you can do this at the
level of individual customers.  If you fire or avoid toxic customers,
you can decrease the amount of bullshit in your life by more than
you decrease your income.<br><br>But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the
bullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's
fault but your own.  And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder
to eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you.  Things that
lure you into wasting your time have to be really good at
tricking you.  An example that will be familiar to a lot of people
is arguing online.  When someone
contradicts you, they're in a sense attacking you. Sometimes pretty
overtly.  Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself.  But
like a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we
now live in.  Counterintuitive as it feels, it's better most of
the time not to defend yourself.  Otherwise these people are literally
taking your life.
<font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Arguing online is only incidentally addictive. There are more
dangerous things than that. As I've written before, one byproduct
of technical progress is that things we like tend to become <a href="addiction.html"><u>more
addictive</u></a>.  Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious
effort to avoid addictions � to stand outside ourselves and ask "is
this how I want to be spending my time?"<br><br>As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things
that matter.  But different things matter to different people, and
most have to learn what matters to them.  A few are lucky and realize
early on that they love math or taking care of animals or writing,
and then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it.  But
most people start out with a life that's a mix of things that
matter and things that don't, and only gradually learn to distinguish
between them.<br><br>For the young especially, much of this confusion is induced by the
artificial situations they find themselves in. In middle school and
high school, what the other kids think of you seems the most important
thing in the world.  But when you ask adults what they got wrong
at that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kids
thought of them.<br><br>One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask
yourself whether you'll care about it in the future.  Fake stuff
that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter.  That's
how it tricks you.  The area under the curve is small, but its shape
jabs into your consciousness like a pin.<br><br>The things that matter aren't necessarily the ones people would
call "important."  Having coffee with a friend matters.  You won't
feel later like that was a waste of time.<br><br>One great thing about having small children is that they make you
spend time on things that matter: them. They grab your sleeve as
you're staring at your phone and say "will you play with me?" And
odds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option.<br><br>If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by
surprise. And that is just what tends to happen.  You take things
for granted, and then they're gone.  You think you can always write
that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize
the window has closed.  The saddest windows close when other people
die. Their lives are short too.  After my mother died, I wished I'd
spent more time with her.  I lived as if she'd always be there.
And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion.  But an
illusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I
did.<br><br>The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to
be consciously aware of it.  Back when life was more precarious,
people used to be aware of death to a degree that would now seem a
bit morbid.  I'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the right answer
to be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at
everyone's shoulder.  Perhaps a better solution is to look at the
problem from the other end. Cultivate a habit of impatience about
the things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that
mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother.  You don't
need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait.
Just don't wait.<br><br>I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much
of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has.  Both
make sense here.<br><br>How you live affects how long you live.  Most people could do better.
Me among them.<br><br>But you can probably get even more effect by paying closer attention
to the time you have.  It's easy to let the days rush by.  The
"flow" that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousin
that prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurry
of errands and alarms.  One of the most striking things I've read
was not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter's <i>Burning
the Days</i>.<br><br>It is possible to slow time somewhat. I've gotten better at it.
Kids help.  When you have small children, there are a lot of moments
so perfect that you can't help noticing.<br><br>It does help too to feel that you've squeezed everything out of
some experience.  The reason I'm sad about my mother is not just
that I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have
done that we didn't.  My oldest son will be 7 soon.  And while I
miss the 3 year old version of him, I at least don't have any regrets
over what might have been.  We had the best time a daddy and a 3
year old ever had.<br><br>Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter,
and savor the time you have.  That's what you do when life is short.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
At first I didn't like it that the word that came to mind was
one that had other meanings.  But then I realized the other meanings
are fairly closely related.  Bullshit in the sense of things you
waste your time on is a lot like intellectual bullshit.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
I chose this example deliberately as a note to self.  I get
attacked a lot online.  People tell the craziest lies about me.
And I have so far done a pretty mediocre job of suppressing the
natural human inclination to say "Hey, that's not true!"<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts

Much of it will apply to other towns.  But not all, because
as I say in the talk, Pittsburgh has some important advantages over
most would-be startup hubs.)</i><br><br>What would it take to make Pittsburgh into a startup hub, like
Silicon Valley?  I understand Pittsburgh pretty well,
because I grew up here, in Monroeville. And I understand Silicon
Valley pretty well because that's where I live now.  Could you get
that kind of startup ecosystem going here?<br><br>When I agreed to speak here, I didn't think I'd be able to give a
very optimistic talk.  I thought I'd be talking about what Pittsburgh
could do to become a startup hub, very much in the subjunctive.
Instead I'm going to talk about what Pittsburgh can do.<br><br>What changed my mind was an article I read in, of all places, the <i>New
York Times</i> food section.  The title was "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/dining/pittsburgh-restaurants.html"><u>Pittsburgh's Youth-Driven
Food Boom</u></a>."  To most people that might not even sound interesting,
let alone something related to startups.  But it was electrifying
to me to read that title.  I don't think I could pick a more promising
one if I tried.  And when I read the article I got even more excited.
It said "people ages 25 to 29 now make up 7.6 percent of all
residents, up from 7 percent about a decade ago."  Wow, I thought,
Pittsburgh could be the next Portland.  It could become the cool
place all the people in their twenties want to go live.<br><br>When I got here a couple days ago, I could feel the difference.  I
lived here from 1968 to 1984.  I didn't realize it at the time, but
during that whole period the city was in free fall. On top of the
flight to the suburbs that happened everywhere, the steel and nuclear
businesses were both dying. Boy are things different now.  It's not
just that downtown seems a lot more prosperous. There is an energy
here that was not here when I was a kid.<br><br>When I was a kid, this was a place young people left. Now it's a
place that attracts them.<br><br>What does that have to do with startups?  Startups are made
of people, and the average age of the people in a typical startup
is right in that 25 to 29 bracket.<br><br>I've seen how powerful it is for a city to have those people.  Five
years ago they shifted the center of gravity of Silicon Valley from
the peninsula to San Francisco.  Google and Facebook are on the
peninsula, but the next generation of big winners are all in SF.
The reason the center of gravity shifted was the talent war, for
programmers especially.  Most 25 to 29 year olds want to live in
the city, not down in the boring suburbs.  So whether they like it
or not, founders know they have to be in the city.  I know multiple
founders who would have preferred to live down in the Valley proper,
but who made themselves move to SF because they knew otherwise
they'd lose the talent war.<br><br>So being a magnet for people in their twenties is a very promising
thing to be.  It's hard to imagine a place becoming a startup hub
without also being that.  When I read that statistic about the
increasing percentage of 25 to 29 year olds, I had exactly the same
feeling of excitement I get when I see a startup's graphs start to
creep upward off the x axis.<br><br>Nationally the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds is 6.8%.  That means
you're .8% ahead.  The population is 306,000, so we're talking about
a surplus of about 2500 people.  That's the population of a small
town, and that's just the surplus. So you have a toehold.  Now you
just have to expand it.<br><br>And though "youth-driven food boom" may sound frivolous, it is
anything but.  Restaurants and cafes are a big part of the personality
of a city.  Imagine walking down a street in Paris. What are you
walking past?  Little restaurants and cafes.  Imagine driving through
some depressing random exurb.  What are you driving past?  Starbucks
and McDonalds and Pizza Hut.   As Gertrude Stein said, there is no
there there. You could be anywhere.<br><br>These independent restaurants and cafes are not just feeding people.
They're making there be a there here.<br><br>So here is my first concrete recommendation for turning Pittsburgh
into the next Silicon Valley: do everything you can to encourage
this youth-driven food boom.  What could the city do?  Treat the
people starting these little restaurants and cafes as your users,
and go ask them what they want.  I can guess at least one thing
they might want: a fast permit process.  San Francisco has left you
a huge amount of room to beat them in that department.<br><br>I know restaurants aren't the prime mover though.  The prime mover,
as the Times article said, is cheap housing.  That's a big advantage.
But that phrase "cheap housing" is a bit misleading.  There are
plenty of places that are cheaper.  What's special about Pittsburgh
is not that it's cheap, but that it's a cheap place you'd actually
want to live.<br><br>Part of that is the buildings themselves. I realized a long time
ago, back when I was a poor twenty-something myself, that the best
deals were places that had once been rich, and then became poor.
If a place has always been rich, it's nice but too expensive.  If
a place has always been poor, it's cheap but grim.  But if a place
was once rich and then got poor, you can find palaces for cheap.
And that's what's bringing people here.  When Pittsburgh was rich,
a hundred years ago, the people who lived here built big solid
buildings.  Not always in the best taste, but definitely solid.  So
here is another piece of advice for becoming a startup hub: don't
destroy the buildings that are bringing people here.  When cities
are on the way back up, like Pittsburgh is now, developers race to
tear down the old buildings.  Don't let that happen.  Focus on
historic preservation.  Big real estate development projects are
not what's bringing the twenty-somethings here.  They're the opposite
of the new restaurants and cafes; they subtract personality from
the city.<br><br>The empirical evidence suggests you cannot be too strict about
historic preservation.  The tougher cities are about it, the better
they seem to do.<br><br>But the appeal of Pittsburgh is not just the buildings themselves.
It's the neighborhoods they're in. Like San Francisco and New York,
Pittsburgh is fortunate in being a pre-car city.  It's not too
spread out. Because those 25 to 29 year olds do not like driving.
They prefer walking, or bicycling, or taking public transport.  If
you've been to San Francisco recently you can't help noticing the
huge number of bicyclists.  And this is not just a fad that the
twenty-somethings have adopted.  In this respect they have discovered
a better way to live.  The beards will go, but not the bikes.  Cities
where you can get around without driving are just better period.
So I would suggest you do everything you can to capitalize on this.
As with historic preservation, it seems impossible to go too far.<br><br>Why not make Pittsburgh the most bicycle and pedestrian friendly
city in the country?  See if you can go so far that you make San
Francisco seem backward by comparison.  If you do, it's very unlikely
you'll regret it.  The city will seem like a paradise to the young
people you want to attract.  If they do leave to get jobs elsewhere,
it will be with regret at leaving behind such a place.  And what's
the downside?  Can you imagine a headline "City ruined by becoming
too bicycle-friendly?"  It just doesn't happen.<br><br>So suppose cool old neighborhoods and cool little restaurants make
this the next Portland.  Will that be enough?  It will put you in
a way better position than Portland itself, because Pittsburgh has
something Portland lacks: a first-rate research university.  CMU
plus little cafes means you have more than hipsters drinking lattes.
It means you have hipsters drinking lattes while talking about
distributed systems.  Now you're getting really close to San
Francisco.<br><br>In fact you're better off than San Francisco in one way, because
CMU is downtown, but Stanford and Berkeley are out in the suburbs.<br><br>What can CMU do to help Pittsburgh become a startup hub?  Be an
even better research university.  CMU is one of the best universities
in the world, but imagine what things would be like if it were the
very best, and everyone knew it.  There are a lot of ambitious
people who must go to the best place, wherever it is.  If CMU were it, they would all come here. There would be
kids in Kazakhstan dreaming of one day living in Pittsburgh.<br><br>Being that kind of talent magnet is the most important contribution
universities can make toward making their city a startup hub.  In
fact it is practically the only contribution they can make.<br><br>But wait, shouldn't universities be setting up programs with words
like "innovation" and "entrepreneurship" in their names?  No, they
should not.  These kind of things almost always turn out to be
disappointments.  They're pursuing the wrong targets.  The way to
get innovation is not to aim for innovation but to aim for something
more specific, like better batteries or better 3D printing.  And
the way to learn about entrepreneurship is to do it, which you 
<a href="before.html"><u>can't
in school</u></a>.<br><br>I know it may disappoint some administrators to hear that the best
thing a university can do to encourage startups is to be a great
university.  It's like telling people who want to lose weight that
the way to do it is to eat less.<br><br>But if you want to know where startups come from, look at the
empirical evidence.  Look at the histories of the most successful
startups, and you'll find they grow organically out of a couple of
founders building something that starts as an interesting side
project.  Universities are great at bringing together founders, but
beyond that the best thing they can do is get out of the way.  For
example, by not claiming ownership of "intellectual property" that
students and faculty develop, and by having liberal rules about
deferred admission and leaves of absence.<br><br>In fact, one of the most effective things a university could do to
encourage startups is an elaborate form of getting out of the way
invented by Harvard.  Harvard used to have exams for the fall
semester after Christmas.  At the beginning of January they had
something called "Reading Period" when you were supposed to be
studying for exams.  And Microsoft and Facebook have something in
common that few people realize: they were both started during Reading
Period.  It's the perfect situation for producing the sort of side
projects that turn into startups. The students are all on campus,
but they don't have to do anything because they're supposed to be
studying for exams.<br><br>Harvard may have closed this window, because a few years ago they
moved exams before Christmas and shortened reading period from 11
days to 7.  But if a university really wanted to help its students
start startups, the empirical evidence, weighted by market cap,
suggests the best thing they can do is literally nothing.<br><br>The culture of Pittsburgh is another of its strengths.  It seems
like a city has to be socially liberal to be a startup hub,
and it's pretty clear why. A city has to tolerate strangeness to
be a home for startups, because startups are so strange.  And you
can't choose to allow just the forms of strangeness that will turn
into big startups, because they're all intermingled.  You have to
tolerate all strangeness.<br><br>That immediately rules out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/us/gay-rights-mississippi-north-carolina.html"><u>big chunks of the US</u></a>.  I'm optimistic
it doesn't rule out Pittsburgh.  One of the things I remember from
growing up here, though I didn't realize at the time that there was
anything unusual about it, is how well people got along.  I'm still
not sure why.  Maybe one reason was that everyone felt like an
immigrant.  When I was a kid in Monroeville, people didn't call
themselves American.  They called themselves Italian or Serbian or
Ukranian.  Just imagine what it must have been like here a hundred
years ago, when people were pouring in from twenty different
countries.  Tolerance was the only option.<br><br>What I remember about the culture of Pittsburgh is that it was
both tolerant and pragmatic.  That's how I'd describe the culture
of Silicon Valley too.  And it's not a coincidence, because Pittsburgh
was the Silicon Valley of its time.  This was a city where people
built new things.  And while the things people build have changed,
the spirit you need to do that kind of work is the same.<br><br>So although an influx of latte-swilling hipsters may be annoying
in some ways, I would go out of my way to encourage them.  And more
generally to tolerate strangeness, even unto the degree wacko
Californians do.  For Pittsburgh that is a conservative choice:
it's a return to the city's roots.<br><br>Unfortunately I saved the toughest part for last. There is one more
thing you need to be a startup hub, and Pittsburgh hasn't got it:
investors.  Silicon Valley has a big investor community because
it's had 50 years to grow one.  New York has a big investor community
because it's full of people who like money a lot and are quick to
notice new ways to get it.  But Pittsburgh has neither of these.
And the cheap housing that draws other people here has no effect
on investors.<br><br>If an investor community grows up here, it will happen the same way
it did in Silicon Valley: slowly and organically.  So I would not
bet on having a big investor community in the short term.  But
fortunately there are three trends that make that less necessary
than it used to be.  One is that startups are increasingly cheap
to start, so you just don't need as much outside money as you used
to.  The second is that thanks to things like Kickstarter, a startup
can get to revenue faster.  You can put something on Kickstarter
from anywhere.  The third is programs like Y Combinator.  A startup
from anywhere in the world can go to YC for 3 months, pick up
funding, and then return home if they want.<br><br>My advice is to make Pittsburgh a great place for startups, and
gradually more of them will stick.  Some of those will succeed;
some of their founders will become investors; and still more startups
will stick.<br><br>This is not a fast path to becoming a startup hub. But it is at
least a path, which is something few other cities have.  And it's
not as if you have to make painful sacrifices in the meantime.
Think about what I've suggested you should do.  Encourage local
restaurants, save old buildings, take advantage of density, make
CMU the best, promote tolerance.  These are the things that make
Pittsburgh good to live in now.  All I'm saying is that you should
do even more of them.<br><br>And that's an encouraging thought.  If Pittsburgh's path to becoming
a startup hub is to be even more itself, then it has a good chance
of succeeding.  In fact it probably has the best chance of any city
its size.  It will take some effort, and a lot of time, but if any
city can do it, Pittsburgh can.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Charlie Cheever and Jessica Livingston for reading

edit out their mistakes, we underestimate the 
degree of risk they were willing to take.
And because anything a famous scientist did that
wasn't a mistake has probably now become the
conventional wisdom, those choices don't
seem risky either.<br><br>Biographies of Newton, for example, understandably focus
more on physics than alchemy or theology.
The impression we get is that his unerring judgment
led him straight to truths no one else had noticed.
How to explain all the time he spent on alchemy
and theology?  Well, smart people are often kind of
crazy.<br><br>But maybe there is a simpler explanation. Maybe
the smartness and the craziness were not as separate
as we think. Physics seems to us a promising thing
to work on, and alchemy and theology obvious wastes
of time. But that's because we know how things
turned out. In Newton's day the three problems 
seemed roughly equally promising. No one knew yet
what the payoff would be for inventing what we
now call physics; if they had, more people would 
have been working on it. And alchemy and theology
were still then in the category Marc Andreessen would 
describe as "huge, if true."<br><br>Newton made three bets. One of them worked. But

F&nbsp;=&nbsp;ma for example. But general and surprising is a hard
combination to achieve. That territory tends to be picked
clean, precisely because those insights are so valuable.<br><br>Ordinarily, the best that people can do is one without the
other: either surprising without being general (e.g.
gossip), or general without being surprising (e.g.
platitudes).<br><br>Where things get interesting is the moderately valuable
insights.  You get those from small additions of whichever
quality was missing.  The more common case is a small
addition of generality: a piece of gossip that's more than
just gossip, because it teaches something interesting about
the world. But another less common approach is to focus on
the most general ideas and see if you can find something new
to say about them. Because these start out so general, you
only need a small delta of novelty to produce a useful
insight.<br><br>A small delta of novelty is all you'll be able to get most
of the time. Which means if you take this route, your ideas
will seem a lot like ones that already exist. Sometimes
you'll find you've merely rediscovered an idea that did
already exist.  But don't be discouraged.  Remember the huge
multiplier that kicks in when you do manage to think of
something even a little new.<br><br>Corollary: the more general the ideas you're talking about,
the less you should worry about repeating yourself.  If you
write enough, it's inevitable you will.  Your brain is much
the same from year to year and so are the stimuli that hit
it. I feel slightly bad when I find I've said something
close to what I've said before, as if I were plagiarizing
myself. But rationally one shouldn't.  You won't say
something exactly the same way the second time, and that
variation increases the chance you'll get that tiny but
critical delta of novelty.<br><br>And of course, ideas beget ideas.  (That sounds 
<a href="ecw.html"><u>familiar</u></a>.)
An idea with a small amount of novelty could lead to one
with more. But only if you keep going. So it's doubly
important not to let yourself be discouraged by people who
say there's not much new about something you've discovered.
"Not much new" is a real achievement when you're talking
about the most general ideas. <!-- Maybe if you keep going,
you'll discover more. --><br><br>It's not true that there's nothing new under the sun.  There
are some domains where there's almost nothing new.  But
there's a big difference between nothing and almost nothing,
when it's multiplied by the area under the sun.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

and determination. But there's a third ingredient that's not as
well understood: an obsessive interest in a particular topic.<br><br>To explain this point I need to burn my reputation with some group
of people, and I'm going to choose bus ticket collectors.  There
are people who collect old bus tickets. Like many collectors, they
have an obsessive interest in the minutiae of what they collect.
They can keep track of distinctions between different types of bus
tickets that would be hard for the rest of us to remember.  Because
we don't care enough. What's the point of spending so much time
thinking about old bus tickets?<br><br>Which leads us to the second feature of this kind of obsession:
there is no point. A bus ticket collector's love is disinterested.
They're not doing it to impress us or to make themselves rich, but
for its own sake.<br><br>When you look at the lives of people who've done great work, you
see a consistent pattern. They often begin with a bus ticket
collector's obsessive interest in something that would have seemed
pointless to most of their contemporaries. One of the most striking
features of Darwin's book about his voyage on the Beagle is the
sheer depth of his interest in natural history. His curiosity seems
infinite. Ditto for Ramanujan, sitting by the hour working out on
his slate what happens to series.<br><br>It's a mistake to think they were "laying the groundwork" for the
discoveries they made later. There's too much intention in that
metaphor. Like bus ticket collectors, they were doing it
because they liked it.<br><br>But there is a difference between Ramanujan and a bus ticket
collector. Series matter, and bus tickets don't.<br><br>If I had to put the recipe for genius into one sentence, that might
be it: to have a disinterested obsession with something that matters.<br><br>Aren't I forgetting about the other two ingredients? Less than you
might think. An obsessive interest in a topic is both a proxy for
ability and a substitute for determination.  Unless you have
sufficient mathematical aptitude, you won't find series interesting.
And when you're obsessively interested in something, you don't need
as much determination: you don't need to push yourself as hard when
curiosity is pulling you.<br><br>An obsessive interest will even bring you luck, to the extent
anything can. Chance, as Pasteur said, favors the prepared mind,
and if there's one thing an obsessed mind is, it's prepared.<br><br>The disinterestedness of this kind of obsession is its most important
feature. Not just because it's a filter for earnestness, but because
it helps you discover new ideas.<br><br>The paths that lead to new ideas tend to look unpromising. If they
looked promising, other people would already have explored them.
How do the people who do great work discover these paths that others
overlook?  The popular story is that they simply have better vision:
because they're so talented, they see paths that others miss.  But
if you look at the way great discoveries are made, that's not what
happens. Darwin didn't pay closer attention to individual species
than other people because he saw that this would lead to great
discoveries, and they didn't. He was just really, really interested
in such things.<br><br>Darwin couldn't turn it off. Neither could Ramanujan.  They didn't
discover the hidden paths that they did because they seemed promising,
but because they couldn't help it. That's what allowed them to
follow paths that someone who was merely ambitious would have
ignored.<br><br>What rational person would decide that the way to write great novels
was to begin by spending several years creating an imaginary elvish
language, like Tolkien, or visiting every household in southwestern
Britain, like Trollope? No one, including Tolkien and Trollope.<br><br>The bus ticket theory is similar to Carlyle's famous definition of
genius as an infinite capacity for taking pains. But there are two
differences. The bus ticket theory makes it clear that the source
of this infinite capacity for taking pains is not infinite diligence,
as Carlyle seems to have meant, but the sort of infinite interest
that collectors have. It also adds an important qualification: an
infinite capacity for taking pains about something that matters.<br><br>So what  matters? You can never be sure. It's precisely because no
one can tell in advance which paths are promising that you can
discover new ideas by working on what you're interested in.<br><br>But there are some heuristics you can use to guess whether an
obsession might be one that matters. For example, it's more promising
if you're creating something, rather than just consuming something
someone else creates. It's more promising if something you're
interested in is difficult, especially if it's <a href="work.html"><u>more difficult for
other people</u></a> than it is for you. And the obsessions of talented
people are more likely to be promising. When talented people become
interested in random things, they're not truly random.<br><br>But you can never be sure. In fact, here's an interesting idea
that's also rather alarming if it's true: it may be that to do great
work, you also have to waste a lot of time.<br><br>In many different areas, reward is proportionate to risk. If that
rule holds here, then the way to find paths that lead to truly great
work is to be willing to expend a lot of effort on things that turn
out to be every bit as unpromising as they seem.<br><br>I'm not sure if this is true. On one hand, it seems surprisingly
difficult to waste your time so long as you're working hard on
something interesting. So much of what you do ends up being useful.
But on the other hand, the rule about the relationship between risk
and reward is so powerful that it seems to hold wherever risk occurs.
<a href="disc.html"><u>Newton's</u></a> case, at least, suggests that the risk/reward rule holds
here. He's famous for one particular obsession of his that turned
out to be unprecedentedly fruitful: using math to describe the
world. But he had two other obsessions, alchemy and theology, that
seem to have been complete wastes of time. He ended up net ahead.
His bet on what we now call physics paid off so well that it more
than compensated for the other two. But were the other two necessary,
in the sense that he had to take big risks to make such big
discoveries? I don't know.<br><br>Here's an even more alarming idea: might one make all bad bets?  It
probably happens quite often. But we don't know how often, because
these people don't become famous.<br><br>It's not merely that the returns from following a path are hard to
predict. They change dramatically over time. 1830 was a really good
time to be obsessively interested in natural history. If Darwin had
been born in 1709 instead of 1809, we might never have heard of
him.<br><br>What can one do in the face of such uncertainty?  One solution is
to hedge your bets, which in this case means to follow the obviously
promising paths instead of your own private obsessions. But as with
any hedge, you're decreasing reward when you decrease risk.  If you
forgo working on what you like in order to follow some more
conventionally ambitious path, you might miss something wonderful
that you'd otherwise have discovered. That too must happen all the
time, perhaps even more often than the genius whose bets all fail.<br><br>The other solution is to let yourself be interested in lots of
different things. You don't decrease your upside if you switch
between equally genuine interests based on which seems to be working
so far. But there is a danger here too: if you work on too many
different projects, you might not get deeply enough into any of
them.<br><br>One interesting thing about the bus ticket theory is that it may
help explain why different types of people excel at different kinds
of work. Interest is much more unevenly distributed than ability.
If natural ability is all you need to do great work, and natural
ability is evenly distributed, you have to invent elaborate theories
to explain the skewed distributions we see among those who actually
do great work in various fields. But it may be that much of the
skew has a simpler explanation: different people are interested in
different things.<br><br>The bus ticket theory also explains why people are less likely to
do great work after they have children. Here interest has to compete
not just with external obstacles, but with another interest, and
one that for most people is extremely powerful. It's harder to find
time for work after you have kids, but that's the easy part. The
real change is that you don't <xa href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/186050/children-key-factor-women-desire-work-outside-home.aspx">want to.<br><br>But the most exciting implication of the bus ticket theory is that
it suggests ways to encourage great work. If the recipe for genius
is simply natural ability plus hard work, all we can do is hope we
have a lot of ability, and work as hard as we can. But if interest
is a critical ingredient in genius, we may be able, by cultivating
interest, to cultivate genius.<br><br>For example, for the very ambitious, the bus ticket theory suggests
that the way to do great work is to relax a little. Instead of
gritting your teeth and diligently pursuing what all your peers
agree is the most promising line of research, maybe you should try
doing something just for fun. And if you're stuck, that may be the
vector along which to break out.<br><br>I've always liked <a href="hamming.html"><u>Hamming's</u></a> famous double-barrelled question: what
are the most important problems in your field, and why aren't you
working on one of them? It's a great way to shake yourself up. But
it may be overfitting a bit. It might be at least as useful to ask
yourself: if you could take a year off to work on something that
probably wouldn't be important but would be really interesting,
what would it be?<br><br>The bus ticket theory also suggests a way to avoid slowing down as
you get older. Perhaps the reason people have fewer new ideas as
they get older is not simply that they're losing their edge. It may
also be because once you become established, you can no longer mess
about with irresponsible side projects the way you could when you
were young and no one cared what you did.<br><br>The solution to that is obvious: remain irresponsible. It will be
hard, though, because the apparently random projects you take up
to stave off decline will read to outsiders as evidence of it.  And
you yourself won't know for sure that they're wrong. But it will
at least be more fun to work on what you want.<br><br>It may even be that we can cultivate a habit of intellectual bus
ticket collecting in kids. The usual plan in education is to start
with a broad, shallow focus, then gradually become more specialized.
But I've done the opposite with my kids. I know I can count on their
school to handle the broad, shallow part, so I take them deep.<br><br>When they get interested in something, however random, I encourage
them to go preposterously, bus ticket collectorly, deep.  I don't
do this because of the bus ticket theory. I do it because I want
them to feel the joy of learning, and they're never going to feel
that about something I'm making them learn. It has to be something
they're interested in. I'm just following the path of least resistance;
depth is a byproduct. But if in trying to show them the joy of
learning I also end up training them to go deep, so much the better.<br><br>Will it have any effect? I have no idea. But that uncertainty may
be the most interesting point of all. There is so much more to learn
about how to do great work. As old as human civilization feels,
it's really still very young if we haven't nailed something so
basic. It's exciting to think there are still discoveries to make
about discovery. If that's the sort of thing you're interested in.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] There are other types of collecting that illustrate this point
better than bus tickets, but they're also more popular. It seemed
just as well to use an inferior example rather than offend more
people by telling them their hobby doesn't matter.<br><br>[2] I worried a little about using the word "disinterested," since
some people mistakenly believe it means not interested. But anyone
who expects to be a genius will have to know the meaning of such a
basic word, so I figure they may as well start now.<br><br>[3] Think how often genius must have been nipped in the bud by
people being told, or telling themselves, to stop messing about and
be responsible. Ramanujan's mother was a huge enabler. Imagine if
she hadn't been. Imagine if his parents had made him go out and get
a job instead of sitting around at home doing math.<br><br>On the other hand, anyone quoting the preceding paragraph to justify
not getting a job is probably mistaken.<br><br>[4] 1709 Darwin is to time what the <a href="cities.html"><u>Milanese Leonardo</u></a> is to space.<br><br>[5] "An infinite capacity for taking pains" is a paraphrase of what
Carlyle wrote. What he wrote, in his <i>History of Frederick the Great</i>,
was "... it is the fruit of 'genius' (which means transcendent
capacity of taking trouble, first of all)...." Since the paraphrase
seems the name of the idea at this point, I kept it.<br><br>Carlyle's <i>History</i> was published in 1858. In 1785 H�rault de S�chelles
quoted Buffon as saying "Le g�nie n'est qu'une plus grande aptitude
� la patience." (Genius is only a greater aptitude for patience.)<br><br>[6] Trollope was establishing the system of postal routes. He himself
sensed the obsessiveness with which he pursued this goal.
<blockquote>
   It is amusing to watch how a passion will grow upon a man. During
   those two years it was the ambition of my life to cover the
   country with rural letter-carriers.
</blockquote>
Even Newton occasionally sensed the degree of his obsessiveness.
After computing pi to 15 digits, he wrote in a letter to a friend:
<blockquote>
   I am ashamed to tell you to how many figures I carried these
   computations, having no other business at the time.
</blockquote>
Incidentally, Ramanujan was also a compulsive calculator. As Kanigel
writes in his excellent biography:
<blockquote>
  One Ramanujan scholar, B. M. Wilson, later told how Ramanujan's
  research into number theory was often "preceded by a table of
  numerical results, carried usually to a length from which most
  of us would shrink."
</blockquote>
[7] Working to understand the natural world counts as creating
rather than consuming.<br><br>Newton tripped over this distinction when he chose
to work on theology. His beliefs did not allow him to see it, but
chasing down paradoxes in nature is fruitful in a way that chasing
down paradoxes in sacred texts is not.<br><br>[8] How much of people's propensity to become interested in a topic
is inborn?  My experience so far suggests the answer is: most of
it. Different kids get interested in different things, and it's
hard to make a child interested in something they wouldn't otherwise
be. Not in a way that sticks.  The most you can do on behalf of a
topic is to make sure it gets a fair showing � to make it clear to
them, for example, that there's more to math than the dull drills
they do in school. After that it's up to the child.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Marc Andreessen, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Kevin

accused of some form of heresy.<br><br>To discover new things, you have
to work on ideas that are good but non-obvious; if an idea is
obviously good, other people are probably already working on it.
One common way for a good idea to be non-obvious is for it to be hidden in the
shadow of some mistaken assumption that people are very attached to.
But anything you discover from working on such an idea will tend to
contradict the mistaken assumption that was concealing it.  And you
will thus get a lot of heat from people attached to the mistaken
assumption. Galileo and Darwin are famous examples of this phenomenon,
but it's probably always an ingredient in the resistance to new
ideas.<br><br>So it's particularly dangerous for an organization or society to
have a culture of pouncing on heresy.  When you suppress heresies,
you don't just prevent people from contradicting the mistaken
assumption you're trying to protect. You also suppress any idea
that implies indirectly that it's false.
<!--
When you suppress heresy, you silence not just your opponents but
also everyone who contradicts you unintentionally.  And because
ideas are so interconnected, you're almost certainly silencing more
people than you realize. 
--><br><br>Every cherished mistaken assumption has
a dead zone of unexplored ideas around it.  And the more preposterous
the assumption, the bigger the dead zone it creates.<br><br>There is a positive side to this phenomenon though.  If you're
looking for new ideas, one way to find them is by <a href="say.html"><u>looking for
heresies</u></a>.  When you look at the question this way, the depressingly
large dead zones around mistaken assumptions become excitingly large
mines of new ideas.<br><br><br><br><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://note.com/tokyojack/n/n2cd5fc7b8eeb">Japanese Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://ideanomics.ru/articles/19728">Russian Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://www.douban.com/note/758984996/">Simplified Chinese Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

The most damaging thing you learned in school wasn't something you
learned in any specific class. It was learning to get good grades.<br><br>When I was in college, a particularly earnest philosophy grad student
once told me that he never cared what grade he got in a class, only
what he learned in it. This stuck in my mind because it was the
only time I ever heard anyone say such a thing.<br><br>For me, as for most students, the measurement of what I was learning
completely dominated actual learning in college.  I was fairly
earnest; I was genuinely interested in most of the classes I took,
and I worked hard. And yet I worked by far the hardest when I was
studying for a test.<br><br>In theory, tests are merely what their name implies: tests of what
you've learned in the class. In theory you shouldn't have to prepare
for a test in a class any more than you have to prepare for a blood
test. In theory you learn from taking the class, from going to the
lectures and doing the reading and/or assignments, and the test
that comes afterward merely measures how well you learned.<br><br>In practice, as almost everyone reading this will know, things are
so different that hearing this explanation of how classes and tests
are meant to work is like hearing the etymology of a word whose
meaning has changed completely. In practice, the phrase "studying
for a test" was almost redundant, because that was when one really
studied.  The difference between diligent and slack students was
that the former studied hard for tests and the latter didn't.  No
one was pulling all-nighters two weeks into the semester.<br><br>Even though I was a diligent student, almost all the work I did in
school was aimed at getting a good grade on something.<br><br>To many people, it would seem strange that the preceding sentence
has a "though" in it. Aren't I merely stating a tautology? Isn't
that what a diligent student is, a straight-A student? That's how
deeply the conflation of learning with grades has infused our
culture.<br><br>Is it so bad if learning is conflated with grades?  Yes, it is bad.
And it wasn't till decades after college, when I was running Y&nbsp;Combinator, that I realized how bad it is.<br><br>I knew of course when I was a student that studying for a test is
far from identical with actual learning. At the very least, you
don't retain knowledge you cram into your head the night before an
exam. But the problem is worse than that. The real problem is that
most tests don't come close to measuring what they're supposed to.<br><br>If tests truly were tests of learning, things wouldn't be so bad.
Getting good grades and learning would converge, just a little late.
The problem is that nearly all tests given to students are terribly
hackable. Most people who've gotten good grades know this, and know
it so well they've ceased even to question it.  You'll see when you
realize how naive it sounds to act otherwise.<br><br>Suppose you're taking a class on medieval history and the final
exam is coming up. The final exam is supposed to be a test of your
knowledge of medieval history, right? So if you have a couple days
between now and the exam, surely the best way to spend the time,
if you want to do well on the exam, is to read the best books you
can find about medieval history. Then you'll know a lot about it,
and do well on the exam.<br><br>No, no, no, experienced students are saying to themselves.  If you
merely read good books on medieval history, most of the stuff you
learned wouldn't be on the test.  It's not good books you want to
read, but the lecture notes and assigned reading in this class.
And even most of that you can ignore, because you only have to worry
about the sort of thing that could turn up as a test question.
You're looking for sharply-defined chunks of information. If one
of the assigned readings has an interesting digression on some
subtle point, you can safely ignore that, because it's not the sort
of thing that could be turned into a test question.  But if the
professor tells you that there were three underlying causes of the
Schism of 1378, or three main consequences of the Black Death, you'd
better know them. And whether they were in fact the causes or
consequences is beside the point.  For the purposes of this class
they are.<br><br>At a university there are often copies of old exams floating around,
and these narrow still further what you have to learn. As well as
learning what kind of questions this professor asks, you'll often
get actual exam questions. Many professors re-use them.  After
teaching a class for 10 years, it would be hard not to, at least
inadvertently.<br><br>In some classes, your professor will have had some sort of political
axe to grind, and if so you'll have to grind it too. The need for
this varies. In classes in math or the hard sciences or engineering
it's rarely necessary, but at the other end of the spectrum there
are classes where you couldn't get a good grade without it.<br><br>Getting a good grade in a class on x is so different from learning
a lot about x that you have to choose one or the other, and you
can't blame students if they choose grades.  Everyone judges them
by their grades � graduate programs, employers, scholarships, even
their own parents.<br><br>I liked learning, and I really enjoyed some of the papers and
programs I wrote in college. But did I ever, after turning in a
paper in some class, sit down and write another just for fun? Of
course not. I had things due in other classes. If it ever came to
a choice of learning or grades, I chose grades. I hadn't come to
college to do badly.<br><br>Anyone who cares about getting good grades has to play this game,
or they'll be surpassed by those who do. And at elite universities,
that means nearly everyone, since someone who didn't care about
getting good grades probably wouldn't be there in the first place.
The result is that students compete to maximize the difference
between learning and getting good grades.<br><br>Why are tests so bad? More precisely, why are they so hackable?
Any experienced programmer could answer that. How hackable is
software whose author hasn't paid any attention to preventing it
from being hacked? Usually it's as porous as a colander.<br><br>Hackable is the default for any test imposed by an authority. The
reason the tests you're given are so consistently bad � so consistently
far from measuring what they're supposed to measure � is simply
that the people creating them haven't made much effort to prevent
them from being hacked.<br><br>But you can't blame teachers if their tests are hackable. Their job
is to teach, not to create unhackable tests. The real problem is
grades, or more precisely, that grades have been overloaded. If
grades were merely a way for teachers to tell students what they
were doing right and wrong, like a coach giving advice to an athlete,
students wouldn't be tempted to hack tests. But unfortunately after
a certain age grades become more than advice. After a certain age,
whenever you're being taught, you're usually also being judged.<br><br>I've used college tests as an example, but those are actually the
least hackable. All the tests most students take their whole lives
are at least as bad, including, most spectacularly of all, the test
that gets them into college. If getting into college were merely a
matter of having the quality of one's mind measured by admissions
officers the way scientists measure the mass of an object, we could
tell teenage kids "learn a lot" and leave it at that.  You can tell
how bad college admissions are, as a test, from how unlike high
school that sounds. In practice, the freakishly specific nature of
the stuff ambitious kids have to do in high school is directly
proportionate to the hackability of college admissions.  The classes
you don't care about that are mostly memorization, the random
"extracurricular activities" you have to participate in to show
you're "well-rounded," the standardized tests as artificial as
chess, the "essay" you have to write that's presumably meant to hit
some very specific target, but you're not told what.<br><br>As well as being bad in what it does to kids, this test is also bad
in the sense of being very hackable. So hackable that whole industries
have grown up to hack it. This is the explicit purpose of test-prep
companies and admissions counsellors, but it's also a significant
part of the function of private schools.<br><br>Why is this particular test so hackable? I think because of what
it's measuring. Although the popular story is that the way to get
into a good college is to be really smart, admissions officers at
elite colleges neither are, nor claim to be, looking only for that.
What are they looking for?  They're looking for people who are not
simply smart, but admirable in some more general sense.  And how
is this more general admirableness measured?  The admissions officers
feel it. In other words, they accept who they like.<br><br>So what college admissions is a test of is whether you suit the
taste of some group of people. Well, of course a test like that is
going to be hackable. And because it's both very hackable and there's
(thought to be) a lot at stake, it's hacked like nothing else.
That's why it distorts your life so much for so long.<br><br>It's no wonder high school students often feel alienated. The shape
of their lives is completely artificial.<br><br>But wasting your time is not the worst thing the educational system
does to you. The worst thing it does is to train you that the way
to win is by hacking bad tests.  This is a much subtler problem
that I didn't recognize until I saw it happening to other people.<br><br>When I started advising startup founders at Y Combinator, especially
young ones, I was puzzled by the way they always seemed to make
things overcomplicated. How, they would ask, do you raise money?
What's the trick for making venture capitalists want to invest in
you? The best way to make VCs want to invest in you, I would explain,
is to actually be a good investment. Even if you could trick VCs
into investing in a bad startup, you'd be tricking yourselves too.
You're investing time in the same company you're asking them to
invest money in. If it's not a good investment, why are you even
doing it?<br><br>Oh, they'd say, and then after a pause to digest this revelation,
they'd ask: What makes a startup a good investment?<br><br>So I would explain that what makes a startup promising, not just
in the eyes of investors but in fact, is 
<a href="growth.html"><u>growth</u></a>.  
Ideally in revenue,
but failing that in usage. What they needed to do was get lots of
users.<br><br>How does one get lots of users? They had all kinds of ideas about
that. They needed to do a big launch that would get them "exposure."
They needed influential people to talk about them. They even knew
they needed to launch on a tuesday, because that's when one gets
the most attention.<br><br>No, I would explain, that is not how to get lots of users. The way
you get lots of users is to make the product really great. Then
people will not only use it but recommend it to their friends, so
your growth will be exponential once you 
<a href="ds.html"><u>get it started</u></a>.<br><br>At this point I've told the founders something you'd think would
be completely obvious: that they should make a good company by
making a good product. And yet their reaction would be something
like the reaction many physicists must have had when they first
heard about the theory of relativity: a mixture of astonishment at
its apparent genius, combined with a suspicion that anything so
weird couldn't possibly be right. Ok, they would say, dutifully.
And could you introduce us to such-and-such influential person? And
remember, we want to launch on Tuesday.<br><br>It would sometimes take founders years to grasp these simple lessons.
And not because they were lazy or stupid. They just seemed blind
to what was right in front of them.<br><br>Why, I would ask myself, do they always make things so complicated?
And then one day I realized this was not a rhetorical question.<br><br>Why did founders tie themselves in knots doing the wrong things
when the answer was right in front of them? Because that was what
they'd been trained to do. Their education had taught them that the
way to win was to hack the test. And without even telling them they
were being trained to do this. The younger ones, the recent graduates,
had never faced a non-artificial test. They thought this was just
how the world worked: that the first thing you did, when facing any
kind of challenge, was to figure out what the trick was for hacking
the test. That's why the conversation would always start with how
to raise money, because that read as the test. It came at the end
of YC. It had numbers attached to it, and higher numbers seemed to
be better. It must be the test.<br><br>There are certainly big chunks of the world where the way to win
is to hack the test. This phenomenon isn't limited to schools.  And
some people, either due to ideology or ignorance, claim that this
is true of startups too. But it isn't. In fact, one of the most
striking things about startups is the degree to which you win by
simply doing good work. There are edge cases, as there are in
anything, but in general you win by getting users, and what users
care about is whether the product does what they want.<br><br>Why did it take me so long to understand why founders made startups
overcomplicated? Because I hadn't realized explicitly that schools
train us to win by hacking bad tests. And not just them, but me!
I'd been trained to hack bad tests too, and hadn't realized it till
decades later.<br><br>I had lived as if I realized it, but without knowing why. For
example, I had avoided working for big companies. But if you'd asked
why, I'd have said it was because they were bogus, or bureaucratic.
Or just yuck. I never understood how much of my dislike of big
companies was due to the fact that you win by hacking bad tests.<br><br>Similarly, the fact that the tests were unhackable was a lot of
what attracted me to startups. But again, I hadn't realized that
explicitly.<br><br>I had in effect achieved by successive approximations something
that may have a closed-form solution.  I had gradually undone my
training in hacking bad tests without knowing I was doing it.  Could
someone coming out of school banish this demon just by knowing its
name, and saying begone? It seems worth trying.<br><br>Merely talking explicitly about this phenomenon is likely to make
things better, because much of its power comes from the fact that
we take it for granted. After you've noticed it, it seems the
elephant in the room, but it's a pretty well camouflaged elephant.
The phenomenon is so old, and so pervasive. And it's simply the
result of neglect. No one meant things to be this way. This is just
what happens when you combine learning with grades, competition,
and the naive assumption of unhackability.<br><br>It was mind-blowing to realize that two of the things I'd puzzled
about the most � the bogusness of high school, and the difficulty
of getting founders to see the obvious � both had the same cause.
It's rare for such a big block to slide into place so late.<br><br>Usually when that happens it has implications in a lot of different
areas, and this case seems no exception. For example, it suggests
both that education could be done better, and how you might fix it.
But it also suggests a potential answer to the question all big
companies seem to have: how can we be more like a startup? I'm not
going to chase down all the implications now. What I want to focus
on here is what it means for individuals.<br><br>To start with, it means that most ambitious kids graduating from
college have something they may want to unlearn.  But it also changes
how you look at the world. Instead of looking at all the different
kinds of work people do and thinking of them vaguely as more or
less appealing, you can now ask a very specific question that will
sort them in an interesting way: to what extent do you win at this
kind of work by hacking bad tests?<br><br>It would help if there was a way to recognize bad tests quickly.
Is there a pattern here? It turns out there is.<br><br>Tests can be divided into two kinds: those that are imposed by
authorities, and those that aren't.  Tests that aren't imposed by
authorities are inherently unhackable, in the sense that no one is
claiming they're tests of anything more than they actually test. A
football match, for example, is simply a test of who wins, not which
team is better. You can tell that from the fact that commentators
sometimes say afterward that the better team won. Whereas tests
imposed by authorities are usually proxies for something else. A
test in a class is supposed to measure not just how well you did
on that particular test, but how much you learned in the class.
While tests that aren't imposed by authorities are inherently
unhackable, those imposed by authorities have to be made unhackable.
Usually they aren't.  So as a first approximation, bad tests are
roughly equivalent to tests imposed by authorities.<br><br>You might actually like to win by hacking bad tests. Presumably
some people do. But I bet most people who find themselves doing
this kind of work don't like it. They just take it for granted that
this is how the world works, unless you want to drop out and be
some kind of hippie artisan.<br><br>I suspect many people implicitly assume that working in a
field with bad tests is the price of making lots of money. But that,
I can tell you, is false. It used to be true. In the mid-twentieth
century, when the economy was 
<a href="re.html"><u>composed of oligopolies</u></a>, 
the only way
to the top was by playing their game. But it's not true now.  There
are now ways to get rich by doing good work, and that's part of the
reason people are so much more excited about getting rich than they
used to be. When I was a kid, you could either become an engineer
and make cool things, or make lots of money by becoming an "executive."
Now you can make lots of money by making cool things.<br><br>Hacking bad tests is becoming less important as the link between
work and authority erodes. The erosion of that link is one of the
most important trends happening now, and we see its effects in
almost every kind of work people do. Startups are one of the most
visible examples, but we see much the same thing in writing. Writers
no longer have to submit to publishers and editors to reach readers;
now they can go direct.<br><br>The more I think about this question, the more optimistic I get.
This seems one of those situations where we don't realize how much
something was holding us back until it's eliminated. And I can
foresee the whole bogus edifice crumbling. Imagine what happens as
more and more people start to ask themselves if they want to win
by hacking bad tests, and decide that they don't.  The kinds of
work where you win by hacking bad tests will be starved of talent,
and the kinds where you win by doing good work will see an influx
of the most ambitious people. And as hacking bad tests shrinks in
importance, education will evolve to stop training us to do it.
Imagine what the world could look like if that happened.<br><br>This is not just a lesson for individuals to unlearn, but one for
society to unlearn, and we'll be amazed at the energy that's liberated
when we do.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] If using tests only to measure learning sounds impossibly
utopian, that is already the way things work at Lambda School.
Lambda School doesn't have grades. You either graduate or you don't.
The only purpose of tests is to decide at each stage of the curriculum
whether you can continue to the next. So in effect the whole school
is pass/fail.<br><br>[2] If the final exam consisted of a long conversation with the
professor, you could prepare for it by reading good books on medieval
history. A lot of the hackability of tests in schools is due to the
fact that the same test has to be given to large numbers of students.<br><br>[3] Learning is the naive algorithm for getting good grades.<br><br>[4] <a href="gba.html"><u>Hacking</u></a> has 
multiple senses. There's a narrow sense in which
it means to compromise something. That's the sense in which one
hacks a bad test. But there's another, more general sense, meaning
to find a surprising solution to a problem, often by thinking
differently about it. Hacking in this sense is a wonderful thing.
And indeed, some of the hacks people use on bad tests are impressively
ingenious; the problem is not so much the hacking as that, because
the tests are hackable, they don't test what they're meant to.<br><br>[5] The people who pick startups at Y Combinator are similar to
admissions officers, except that instead of being arbitrary, their
acceptance criteria are trained by a very tight feedback loop. If
you accept a bad startup or reject a good one, you will usually know it
within a year or two at the latest, and often within a month.<br><br>[6] I'm sure admissions officers are tired of reading applications
from kids who seem to have no personality beyond being willing to
seem however they're supposed to seem to get accepted.  What they
don't realize is that they are, in a sense, looking in a mirror.
The lack of authenticity in the applicants is a reflection of the
arbitrariness of the application process. A dictator might just as
well complain about the lack of authenticity in the people around
him.<br><br>[7] By good work, I don't mean morally good, but good in the sense
in which a good craftsman does good work.<br><br>[8] There are borderline cases where it's hard to say which category
a test falls in. For example, is raising venture capital like college
admissions, or is it like selling to a customer?<br><br>[9] Note that a good test is merely one that's unhackable. Good
here doesn't mean morally good, but good in the sense of working
well. The difference between fields with bad tests and good ones
is not that the former are bad and the latter are good, but that
the former are bogus and the latter aren't. But those two measures
are not unrelated.  As Tara Ploughman said, the path from good to
evil goes through bogus.<br><br>[10] People who think the recent increase in 
<a href="ineq.html"><u>economic inequality</u></a> is
due to changes in tax policy seem very naive to anyone with experience
in startups. Different people are getting rich now than used to,
and they're getting much richer than mere tax savings could make
them.<br><br>[11] Note to tiger parents: you may think you're training your kids
to win, but if you're training them to win by hacking bad tests,
you are, as parents so often do, training them to fight the last
war.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Austen Allred, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison,

Up to that point I
felt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living
virtuously. I'd have been sad to think I'd never have children.
But did I want them now? No.<br><br>If I had kids, I'd become a parent, and parents, as I'd known since
I was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had
no fun.  And while it's not surprising that kids would believe that,
to be honest I hadn't seen much as an adult to change my mind.
Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to be
terrors, and the parents pathetic harried creatures, even when they
prevailed.<br><br>When people had babies, I congratulated them enthusiastically,
because that seemed to be what one did. But I didn't feel it at
all.  "Better you than me," I was thinking.<br><br>Now when people have babies I congratulate them enthusiastically and
I mean it. Especially the first one. I feel like they just got the best gift in the world.<br><br>What changed, of course, is that I had kids. Something I dreaded
turned out to be wonderful.<br><br>Partly, and I won't deny it, this is because of serious chemical
changes that happened almost instantly when our first child was
born.  It was like someone flipped a switch. I suddenly felt
protective not just toward our child, but toward all children. As I was
driving my wife and new son home from the hospital, I approached a
crosswalk full of pedestrians, and I found myself thinking "I have
to be really careful of all these people. Every one of them is
someone's child!"<br><br>So to some extent you can't trust me when I say having kids is
great.  To some extent I'm like a religious cultist telling you
that you'll be happy if you join the cult too � but only because
joining the cult will alter your mind in a way that will make you
happy to be a cult member.<br><br>But not entirely. There were some things
about having kids that I clearly got wrong before I had them.<br><br>For example, there was a huge amount of selection bias in my
observations of parents and children. Some parents may have noticed
that I wrote "Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids." Of course
the times I noticed kids were when things were going wrong. I only
noticed them when they made noise. And where was I when I noticed
them?  Ordinarily I never went to places with kids, so the only
times I encountered them were in shared bottlenecks like airplanes.
Which is not exactly a representative sample. Flying with a toddler
is something very few parents enjoy.<br><br>What I didn't notice, because they tend to be much quieter, were
all the great moments parents had with kids. People don't talk about
these much � the magic is hard to put into words, and all other
parents know about them anyway � but one of the great things about
having kids is that there are so many times when you feel there is
nowhere else you'd rather be, and nothing else you'd rather be
doing.  You don't have to be doing anything special. You could just
be going somewhere together, or putting them to bed, or pushing
them on the swings at the park. But you wouldn't trade these moments
for anything. One doesn't tend to associate kids with peace, but
that's what you feel.  You don't need to look any
further than where you are right now.<br><br>Before I had kids, I had moments of this kind of peace, but they
were rarer. With kids it can happen several times a day.<br><br>My other source of data about kids was my own childhood, and that
was similarly misleading. I was pretty bad, and was always in trouble
for something or other. So it seemed to me that parenthood was
essentially law enforcement.  I didn't realize there were good times
too.<br><br>I remember my mother telling me once when I was about 30 that she'd
really enjoyed having me and my sister. My god, I thought, this
woman is a saint. She not only endured all the pain we subjected
her to, but actually enjoyed it? Now I realize she was simply telling
the truth.<br><br>She said that one reason she liked having us was that we'd been
interesting to talk to. That took me by surprise when I had kids.
You don't just love them. They become your friends too. They're
really interesting. And while I admit small children are disastrously
fond of repetition (anything worth doing once is worth doing fifty
times) it's often genuinely fun to play with them.  That surprised
me too. Playing with a 2 year old was fun when I was 2 and definitely
not fun when I was 6. Why would it become fun again later? But it
does.<br><br>There are of course times that are pure drudgery. Or worse still,
terror. Having kids is one of those intense types of experience
that are hard to imagine unless you've had them. But it is not, as I
implicitly believed before having kids, simply your DNA heading for
the lifeboats.<br><br>Some of my worries about having kids were right, though. They
definitely make you less productive. I know having kids makes some
people get their act together, but if your act was already together,
you're going to have less time to do it in. In particular, you're
going to have to work to a schedule. Kids have schedules.  I'm not
sure if it's because that's how kids are, or because it's the only
way to integrate their lives with adults', but once you have kids,
you tend to have to work on their schedule.<br><br>You will have chunks of time to work. But you can't let work spill
promiscuously through your whole life, like I used to before I had
kids. You're going to have to work at the same time every day,
whether inspiration is flowing or not, and there are going to be
times when you have to stop, even if it is.<br><br>I've been able to adapt to working this way. Work, like love, finds
a way. If there are only certain times it can happen, it happens
at those times. So while I don't get as much done as before I had
kids, I get enough done.<br><br>I hate to say this, because being ambitious has always been a part
of my identity, but having kids may make one less ambitious. It
hurts to see that sentence written down. I squirm to avoid it. But
if there weren't something real there, why would I squirm?  The
fact is, once you have kids, you're probably going to care more
about them than you do about yourself. And attention is a zero-sum
game. Only one idea at a time can be the 
<a href="top.html"><u>top idea in your mind</u></a>.
Once you have kids, it will often be your kids, and that means it
will less often be some project you're working on.<br><br>I have some hacks for sailing close to this wind. For example, when
I write essays, I think about what I'd want my kids to know. That
drives me to get things right. And when I was writing 
<a href="bel.html"><u>Bel</u></a>, I told
my kids that once I finished it I'd take them to Africa. When you
say that sort of thing to a little kid, they treat it as a promise.
Which meant I had to finish or I'd be taking away their trip to
Africa.  Maybe if I'm really lucky such tricks could put me net
ahead. But the wind is there, no question.<br><br>On the other hand, what kind of wimpy ambition do you have if it
won't survive having kids? Do you have so little to spare?<br><br>And while having kids may be warping my present judgement, it hasn't
overwritten my memory. I remember perfectly well what life was like
before. Well enough to miss some things a lot, like the
ability to take off for some other country at a moment's notice.
That was so great. Why did I never do that?<br><br>See what I did there? The fact is, most of the freedom I had before
kids, I never used. I paid for it in loneliness, but I never used
it.<br><br>I had plenty of happy times before I had kids. But if I count up
happy moments, not just potential happiness but actual happy moments,
there are more after kids than before. Now I practically have it
on tap, almost any bedtime.<br><br>People's experiences as parents
vary a lot, and I know I've been lucky. But I think the worries I
had before having kids must be pretty common, and judging by other
parents' faces when they see their kids, so must the happiness that
kids bring.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Note</b><br><br>[1] Adults are sophisticated enough to see 2 year olds for the
fascinatingly complex characters they are, whereas to most 6 year
olds, 2 year olds are just defective 6 year olds.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris

and by accident. Intentional moderates are trimmers, deliberately
choosing a position mid-way between the extremes of right and left.
Accidental moderates end up in the middle, on average, because they
make up their own minds about each question, and the far right and
far left are roughly equally wrong.<br><br>You can distinguish intentional from accidental moderates by the
distribution of their opinions. If the far left opinion on some
matter is 0 and the far right opinion 100, an intentional moderate's
opinion on every question will be near 50. Whereas an accidental
moderate's opinions will be scattered over a broad range, but will,
like those of the intentional moderate, average to about 50.<br><br>Intentional moderates are similar to those on the far left and the
far right in that their opinions are, in a sense, not their own.
The defining quality of an ideologue, whether on the left or the
right, is to acquire one's opinions in bulk. You don't get to pick
and choose. Your opinions about taxation can be predicted from your
opinions about sex. And although intentional moderates
might seem to be the opposite of ideologues, their beliefs (though
in their case the word "positions" might be more accurate) are also
acquired in bulk. If the median opinion shifts to the right or left,
the intentional moderate must shift with it. Otherwise they stop
being moderate.<br><br>Accidental moderates, on the other hand, not only choose their own
answers, but choose their own questions. They may not care at all
about questions that the left and right both think are terribly
important. So you can only even measure the politics of an accidental
moderate from the intersection of the questions they care about and
those the left and right care about, and this can
sometimes be vanishingly small.<br><br>It is not merely a manipulative rhetorical trick to say "if you're
not with us, you're against us," but often simply false.<br><br>Moderates are sometimes derided as cowards, particularly by 
the extreme left. But while it may be accurate to call intentional
moderates cowards, openly being an accidental moderate requires the
most courage of all, because you get attacked from both right and
left, and you don't have the comfort of being an orthodox member
of a large group to sustain you.<br><br>Nearly all the most impressive people I know are accidental moderates.
If I knew a lot of professional athletes, or people in the entertainment
business, that might be different. Being on the far left or far
right doesn't affect how fast you run or how well you sing. But
someone who works with ideas has to be independent-minded to do it
well.<br><br>Or more precisely, you have to be independent-minded about the ideas
you work with. You could be mindlessly doctrinaire in your politics
and still be a good mathematician. In the 20th century, a lot of
very smart people were Marxists � just no one who was smart about
the subjects Marxism involves. But if the ideas you use in your
work intersect with the politics of your time, you have two choices:
be an accidental moderate, or be mediocre.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] It's possible in theory for one side to be entirely right and
the other to be entirely wrong. Indeed, ideologues must always
believe this is the case. But historically it rarely has been.<br><br>[2] For some reason the far right tend to ignore moderates rather
than despise them as backsliders. I'm not sure why. Perhaps it
means that the far right is less ideological than the far left. Or
perhaps that they are more confident, or more resigned, or simply
more disorganized. I just don't know.<br><br>[3] Having heretical opinions doesn't mean you have to express
them openly. It may be
<a href="say.html"><u>easier to have them</u></a> if you don't.<br><br>

surprised by the attention they get as their companies grow, but
it applies equally to anyone who becomes famous.)</i><br><br>If you become sufficiently famous, you'll acquire some fans who
like you too much. These people are sometimes called "fanboys," and
though I dislike that term, I'm going to have to use it here.  We
need some word for them, because this is a distinct phenomenon from
someone simply liking your work.<br><br>A fanboy is obsessive and uncritical. Liking you becomes part of
their identity, and they create an image of you in their own head
that is much better than reality. Everything you do is good, because
you do it. If you do something bad, they find a way to see it as
good. And their love for you is not, usually, a quiet, private one.
They want everyone to know how great you are.<br><br>Well, you may be thinking, I could do without this kind of obsessive
fan, but I know there are all kinds of people in the world, and if
this is the worst consequence of fame, that's not so bad.<br><br>Unfortunately this is not the worst consequence of fame. As well
as fanboys, you'll have haters.<br><br>A hater is obsessive and uncritical. Disliking you becomes part of
their identity, and they create an image of you in their own head
that is much worse than reality. Everything you do is bad, because
you do it. If you do something good, they find a way to see it as
bad. And their dislike for you is not, usually, a quiet, private
one. They want everyone to know how awful you are.<br><br>If you're thinking of checking, I'll save you the trouble. The
second and fifth paragraphs are identical except for "good" being
switched to "bad" and so on.<br><br>I spent years puzzling about haters.  What are they, and where do
they come from? Then one day it dawned on me. Haters are just fanboys
with the sign switched.<br><br>Note that by haters, I don't simply mean trolls. I'm not talking about 
people who say bad things about you and then move on. I'm talking
about the much smaller group of people for whom this becomes a 
kind of obsession and who do it repeatedly over a long period.<br><br>Like fans, haters seem to be an automatic consequence of fame.
Anyone sufficiently famous will have them. And like fans, haters
are energized by the fame of whoever they hate. They hear a song
by some pop singer. They don't like it much. If the singer were an
obscure one, they'd just forget about it. But instead they keep
hearing her name, and this seems to drive some people crazy.
Everyone's always going on about this singer, but she's no good!
She's a fraud!<br><br>That word "fraud" is an important one. It's the spectral signature
of a hater to regard the object of their hatred as a 
<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Musk%20fraud&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live"><u>fraud</u></a>. They
can't deny their fame. Indeed, their fame is if anything exaggerated
in the hater's mind. They notice every mention of the singer's name,
because every mention makes them angrier. In their own minds they
exaggerate both the singer's fame and her lack of talent, and the
only way to reconcile those two ideas is to conclude that she has
tricked everyone.<br><br>What sort of people become haters? Can anyone become one? I'm not
sure about this, but I've noticed some patterns. Haters are generally
losers in a very specific sense: although they are occasionally
talented, they have never achieved much. And indeed, anyone
successful enough to have achieved significant fame would be unlikely
to regard another famous person as a fraud on that account, because
anyone famous knows how random fame is.<br><br>But haters are not always complete losers. They are not always the
proverbial guy living in his mom's basement. Many are, but some
have some amount of talent. In fact I suspect that a sense of
frustrated talent is what drives some people to become haters.
They're not just saying "It's unfair that so-and-so is famous," but
"It's unfair that so-and-so is famous, and not me."<br><br>Could a hater be cured if they achieved something impressive? My
guess is that's a moot point, because they 
<a href="mean.html"><u>never will</u></a>. I've been
able to observe for long enough that I'm fairly confident the pattern
works both ways: not only do people who do great work never become
haters, haters never do great work. Although I dislike the word
"fanboy," it's evocative of something important about both haters
and fanboys. It implies that the fanboy is so slavishly predictable in his admiration
that he's diminished as a result, that he's less than a man.<br><br>Haters seem even more diminished. I can imagine being a fanboy.
I can think of people whose work I admire so much that I could abase
myself before them out of sheer gratitude. If P. G.  Wodehouse were
still alive, I could see myself being a Wodehouse fanboy. But I
could not imagine being a hater.<br><br>Knowing that haters are just fanboys with the sign bit flipped makes
it much easier to deal with them. We don't need a separate theory
of haters. We can just use existing techniques for dealing with
obsessive fans.<br><br>The most important of which is simply not to think much about them.
If you're like most people who become famous enough to acquire
haters, your initial reaction will be one of mystification. Why
does this guy seem to have it in for me? Where does his obsessive
energy come from, and what makes him so appallingly nasty? What did
I do to set him off? Is it something I can fix?<br><br>The mistake here is to think of the hater as someone you have a
dispute with. When you have a dispute with someone, it's usually a
good idea to try to understand why they're upset and then fix things
if you can. Disputes are distracting. But it's a false analogy to
think of a hater as someone you have a dispute with.  It's an
understandable mistake, if you've never encountered haters before.
But when you realize that you're dealing with a hater, and what a
hater is, it's clear that it's a waste of time even to think about
them. If you have obsessive fans, do you spend any time wondering
what makes them love you so much? No, you just think "some
people are kind of crazy," and that's the end of it.<br><br>Since haters are equivalent to fanboys, that's the way to deal with
them too. There may have been something that set them off. But it's
not something that would have set off a normal person, so there's
no reason to spend any time thinking about it. It's not you, it's
them.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] There are of course some people who are genuine frauds. How can
you distinguish between x calling y a fraud because x is a hater,
and because y is a fraud? Look at neutral opinion. Actual frauds
are usually pretty conspicuous. Thoughtful people are rarely taken
in by them. So if there are some thoughtful people who like y, you
can usually assume y is not a fraud.<br><br>[2] I would make an exception for teenagers, who sometimes act in
such extreme ways that they are literally not themselves. I can
imagine a teenage kid being a hater and then growing out of it. But
not anyone over 25.<br><br>[3] I have a much worse memory for misdeeds than my wife Jessica,
who is a connoisseur of character, but I don't wish it were better.
Most disputes are a waste of time even if you're in the right, and
it's easy to bury the hatchet with someone if you can't remember
why you were mad at them.<br><br>[4] A competent hater will not merely attack you individually but
will try to get mobs after you. In some cases you may want to refute
whatever bogus claim they made in order to do so. But err on the
side of not, because ultimately it probably won't matter.<br><br><br><br><font color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Austen Allred, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison,

Now that I'm old, I know this isn't true.<br><br>I constantly feel like a noob. It seems like I'm always talking to
some startup working in a new field I know nothing about, or reading
a book about a topic I don't understand well enough, or visiting some new
country where I don't know how things work.<br><br>It's not pleasant to feel like a noob. And the word "noob" is
certainly not a compliment. And yet today I realized something
encouraging about being a noob: the more of a noob you are locally,
the less of a noob you are globally.<br><br>For example, if you stay in your home country, you'll feel less
of a noob than if you move to Farawavia, where everything works
differently. And yet you'll know more if you move.
So the feeling of being a noob is inversely correlated with actual
ignorance.<br><br>But if the feeling of being a noob is good for us, why do we dislike
it? What evolutionary purpose could such an aversion serve?<br><br>I think the answer is that there are two sources of feeling like a
noob: being stupid, and doing something novel. Our dislike of feeling
like a noob is our brain telling us "Come on, come on, figure this
out." Which was the right thing to be thinking for most of human
history. The life of hunter-gatherers was complex, but it didn't
change as much as life does now. They didn't suddenly have to figure
out what to do about cryptocurrency. So it made sense to be biased
toward competence at existing problems over the discovery of new
ones. It made sense for humans to dislike the feeling of being a
noob, just as, in a world where food was scarce, it made sense for
them to dislike the feeling of being hungry.<br><br>Now that too much food is more of a problem than too little, our
dislike of feeling hungry leads us astray. And I think our dislike
of feeling like a noob does too.<br><br>Though it feels unpleasant, and people will sometimes ridicule you
for it, the more you feel like a noob, the better.<br><br><br><br><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://note.com/tokyojack/n/n199d0f1a0ec6">Japanese Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://tldrarabiccontents.blogspot.com/2020/01/blog-post_20.html">Arabic Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://corrigan2.blogspot.com/2020/01/etre-un-noob-paul-graham.html">French Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://soojin.ro/blog/noob">Korean Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://stronglyagainst.com/pgraham-being-a-noob/">Polish Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://qcngt.com/2020/04/18/noob.html">Chinese Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://jelenadobric.com/writing-translations/biti-noob-paul-graham">Serbian Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://corrigan2.blogspot.com/2020/01/etre-un-noob-paul-graham.html">French Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><div><div><div></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></div><div><br><br><div><h1 id="useful">How to Write Usefully</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">February 2020<br><br>What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That's
what a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we can
aim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.<br><br>To start with, that means it should be correct. But it's not enough
merely to be correct. It's easy to make a statement correct by
making it vague. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for
example. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go
wrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are
many factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too
simplistic a view of it, and so on.<br><br>Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing.
Useful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made
without becoming false.<br><br>For example, it's more useful to say that Pike's Peak is near the
middle of Colorado than merely somewhere in Colorado. But if I say
it's in the exact middle of Colorado, I've now gone too far, because
it's a bit east of the middle.<br><br>Precision and correctness are like opposing forces. It's easy to
satisfy one if you ignore the other. The converse of vaporous
academic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues.
Useful writing is bold, but true.<br><br>It's also two other things: it tells people something important,
and that at least some of them didn't already know.<br><br>Telling people something they didn't know doesn't always mean
surprising them. Sometimes it means telling them something they
knew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact those may
be the more valuable insights, because they tend to be more
fundamental.<br><br>Let's put them all together. Useful writing tells people something
true and important that they didn't already know, and tells them
as unequivocally as possible.<br><br>Notice these are all a matter of degree. For example, you can't
expect an idea to be novel to everyone. Any insight that you have
will probably have already been had by at least one of the world's
7 billion people. But it's sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot
of readers.<br><br>Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength. In effect the four
components are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score
for usefulness. Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, but
nonetheless true.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>
How can you ensure that the things you say are true and novel and
important? Believe it or not, there is a trick for doing this. I
learned it from my friend Robert Morris, who has a horror of saying
anything dumb. His trick is not to say anything unless he's sure
it's worth hearing. This makes it hard to get opinions out of him,
but when you do, they're usually right.<br><br>Translated into essay writing, what this means is that if you write
a bad sentence, you don't publish it. You delete it and try again.
Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes
a whole essay.<br><br>You can't ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can
ensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the
ones that aren't.<br><br>In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered
bad. When some hypothesis you're exploring gets inconclusive results,
you're supposed to tell people about that too. But with essay
writing, publication bias is the way to go.<br><br>My strategy is loose, then tight. I write the first draft of an
essay fast, trying out all kinds of ideas. Then I spend days rewriting
it very carefully.<br><br>I've never tried to count how many times I proofread essays, but
I'm sure there are sentences I've read 100 times before publishing
them. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that
stick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they're clumsily
written, and sometimes because I'm not sure they're true. The
annoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading or
so I'm saying "Ugh, that part" each time I hit it. They become like
briars that catch your sleeve as you walk past. Usually I won't
publish an essay till they're all gone � till I can read through
the whole thing without the feeling of anything catching.<br><br>I'll sometimes let through a sentence that seems clumsy, if I can't
think of a way to rephrase it, but I will never knowingly let through
one that doesn't seem correct. You never have to. If a sentence
doesn't seem right, all you have to do is ask why it doesn't, and
you've usually got the replacement right there in your head.<br><br>This is where essayists have an advantage over journalists. You
don't have a deadline. You can work for as long on an essay as you
need to get it right. You don't have to publish the essay at all,
if you can't get it right. Mistakes seem to lose courage in the
face of an enemy with unlimited resources. Or that's what it feels
like. What's really going on is that you have different expectations
for yourself. You're like a parent saying to a child "we can sit
here all night till you eat your vegetables." Except you're the
child too.<br><br>I'm not saying no mistake gets through. For example, I added condition
(c) in <a href="bias.html"><u>"A Way to Detect Bias"</u></a> 
after readers pointed out that I'd
omitted it. But in practice you can catch nearly all of them.<br><br>There's a trick for getting importance too. It's like the trick I
suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something
you yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader.
The reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about
topics that seem important to you, they'll probably seem important
to a significant number of readers as well.<br><br>Importance has two factors. It's the number of people something
matters to, times how much it matters to them. Which means of course
that it's not a rectangle, but a sort of ragged comb, like a Riemann
sum.<br><br>The way to get novelty is to write about topics you've thought about
a lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this
department too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who've
thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a
significant number of readers. And here, as with correctness and
importance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that you
will. If you don't learn anything from writing an essay, don't
publish it.<br><br>You need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging the
novelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance of
it. Confidence and humility are often seen as opposites, but in
this case, as in many others, confidence helps you to be humble.
If you know you're an expert on some topic, you can freely admit
when you learn something you didn't know, because you can be confident
that most other people wouldn't know it either.<br><br>The fourth component of useful writing, strength, comes from two
things: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification. These
two counterbalance each other, like the accelerator and clutch in
a car with a manual transmission. As you try to refine the expression
of an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly. Something
you're sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification at all,
as I did the four components of useful writing. Whereas points that
seem dubious have to be held at arm's length with perhapses.<br><br>As you refine an idea, you're pushing in the direction of less
qualification. But you can rarely get it down to zero. Sometimes
you don't even want to, if it's a side point and a fully refined
version would be too long.<br><br>Some say that qualifications weaken writing. For example, that you
should never begin a sentence in an essay with "I think," because
if you're saying it, then of course you think it. And it's true
that "I think x" is a weaker statement than simply "x." Which is
exactly why you need "I think." You need it to express your degree
of certainty.<br><br>But qualifications are not scalars. They're not just experimental
error. There must be 50 things they can express: how broadly something
applies, how you know it, how happy you are it's so, even how it
could be falsified. I'm not going to try to explore the structure
of qualification here. It's probably more complex than the whole
topic of writing usefully. Instead I'll just give you a practical
tip: Don't underestimate qualification. It's an important skill in
its own right, not just a sort of tax you have to pay in order to
avoid saying things that are false. So learn and use its full range.
It may not be fully half of having good ideas, but it's part of
having them.<br><br>There's one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things as
simply as possible. But I don't think this is a component of
usefulness. It's more a matter of consideration for the reader. And
it's a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more
obvious when expressed in simple language. But I'll admit that the
main reason I write simply is not for the reader's sake or because
it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more
or fancier words than I need to. It seems inelegant, like a program
that's too long.<br><br>I realize florid writing works for some people. But unless you're
sure you're one of them, the best advice is to write as simply as
you can.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>
I believe the formula I've given you, importance + novelty +
correctness + strength, is the recipe for a good essay. But I should
warn you that it's also a recipe for making people mad.<br><br>The root of the problem is novelty. When you tell people something
they didn't know, they don't always thank you for it. Sometimes the
reason people don't know something is because they don't want to
know it. Usually because it contradicts some cherished belief. And
indeed, if you're looking for novel ideas, popular but mistaken
beliefs are a good place to find them. Every popular mistaken belief
creates a <a href="nov.html"><u>dead zone</u></a> of ideas around 
it that are relatively unexplored because they contradict it.<br><br>The strength component just makes things worse. If there's anything
that annoys people more than having their cherished assumptions
contradicted, it's having them flatly contradicted.<br><br>Plus if you've used the Morris technique, your writing will seem
quite confident. Perhaps offensively confident, to people who
disagree with you. The reason you'll seem confident is that you are
confident: you've cheated, by only publishing the things you're
sure of.  It will seem to people who try to disagree with you that
you never admit you're wrong. In fact you constantly admit you're
wrong. You just do it before publishing instead of after.<br><br>And if your writing is as simple as possible, that just makes things
worse. Brevity is the diction of command. If you watch someone
delivering unwelcome news from a position of inferiority, you'll
notice they tend to use lots of words, to soften the blow. Whereas
to be short with someone is more or less to be rude to them.<br><br>It can sometimes work to deliberately phrase statements more weakly
than you mean. To put "perhaps" in front of something you're actually
quite sure of. But you'll notice that when writers do this, they
usually do it with a wink.<br><br>I don't like to do this too much. It's cheesy to adopt an ironic
tone for a whole essay. I think we just have to face the fact that
elegance and curtness are two names for the same thing.<br><br>You might think that if you work sufficiently hard to ensure that
an essay is correct, it will be invulnerable to attack. That's sort
of true. It will be invulnerable to valid attacks. But in practice
that's little consolation.<br><br>In fact, the strength component of useful writing will make you
particularly vulnerable to misrepresentation. If you've stated an
idea as strongly as you could without making it false, all anyone
has to do is to exaggerate slightly what you said, and now it is
false.<br><br>Much of the time they're not even doing it deliberately. One of the
most surprising things you'll discover, if you start writing essays,
is that people who disagree with you rarely disagree with what
you've actually written. Instead they make up something you said
and disagree with that.<br><br>For what it's worth, the countermove is to ask someone who does
this to quote a specific sentence or passage you wrote that they
believe is false, and explain why. I say "for what it's worth"
because they never do. So although it might seem that this could
get a broken discussion back on track, the truth is that it was
never on track in the first place.<br><br>Should you explicitly forestall likely misinterpretations? Yes, if
they're misinterpretations a reasonably smart and well-intentioned
person might make. In fact it's sometimes better to say something
slightly misleading and then add the correction than to try to get
an idea right in one shot. That can be more efficient, and can also
model the way such an idea would be discovered.<br><br>But I don't think you should explicitly forestall intentional
misinterpretations in the body of an essay. An essay is a place to
meet honest readers. You don't want to spoil your house by putting
bars on the windows to protect against dishonest ones. The place
to protect against intentional misinterpretations is in end-notes.
But don't think you can predict them all. People are as ingenious
at misrepresenting you when you say something they don't want to
hear as they are at coming up with rationalizations for things they
want to do but know they shouldn't. I suspect it's the same skill.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>
As with most other things, the way to get better at writing essays
is to practice. But how do you start? Now that we've examined the
structure of useful writing, we can rephrase that question more
precisely. Which constraint do you relax initially? The answer is,
the first component of importance: the number of people who care
about what you write.<br><br>If you narrow the topic sufficiently, you can probably find something
you're an expert on. Write about that to start with. If you only
have ten readers who care, that's fine. You're helping them, and
you're writing. Later you can expand the breadth of topics you write
about.<br><br>The other constraint you can relax is a little surprising: publication.
Writing essays doesn't have to mean publishing them. That may seem
strange now that the trend is to publish every random thought, but
it worked for me. I wrote what amounted to essays in notebooks for
about 15 years. I never published any of them and never expected
to. I wrote them as a way of figuring things out. But when the web
came along I'd had a lot of practice.<br><br>Incidentally, 
<a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/steve-wozniak.html"><u>Steve 
Wozniak</u></a> did the same thing. In high school he
designed computers on paper for fun. He couldn't build them because
he couldn't afford the components. But when Intel launched 4K DRAMs
in 1975, he was ready.<br><br><center>_____</center><br><br>
How many essays are there left to write though? The answer to that
question is probably the most exciting thing I've learned about
essay writing. Nearly all of them are left to write.<br><br>Although <a href="essay.html"><u>the essay</u></a> 
is an old form, it hasn't been assiduously
cultivated. In the print era, publication was expensive, and there
wasn't enough demand for essays to publish that many. You could
publish essays if you were already well known for writing something
else, like novels. Or you could write book reviews that you took
over to express your own ideas. But there was not really a direct
path to becoming an essayist. Which meant few essays got written,
and those that did tended to be about a narrow range of subjects.<br><br>Now, thanks to the internet, there's a path. Anyone can publish
essays online. You start in obscurity, perhaps, but at least you
can start. You don't need anyone's permission.<br><br>It sometimes happens that an area of knowledge sits quietly for
years, till some change makes it explode. Cryptography did this to
number theory. The internet is doing it to the essay.<br><br>The exciting thing is not that there's a lot left to write, but
that there's a lot left to discover. There's a certain kind of idea
that's best discovered by writing essays. If most essays are still
unwritten, most such ideas are still undiscovered.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] Put railings on the balconies, but don't put bars on the windows.<br><br>[2] Even now I sometimes write essays that are not meant for
publication. I wrote several to figure out what Y Combinator should
do, and they were really helpful.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAh4uS4f78o"><u>video</u></a> 
of TV journalists and politicians confidently
saying that the coronavirus would be no worse than the flu. What
struck me about it was not just how mistaken they seemed, but how
daring. How could they feel safe saying such things?<br><br>The answer, I realized, is that they didn't think they could get
caught. They didn't realize there was any danger in making false
predictions. These people constantly make false predictions, and
get away with it, because the things they make predictions about
either have mushy enough outcomes that they can bluster their way
out of trouble, or happen so far in the future that few remember
what they said.<br><br>An epidemic is different. It falsifies your predictions rapidly and
unequivocally.<br><br>But epidemics are rare enough that these people clearly
didn't realize this was even a possibility. Instead they just
continued to use their ordinary m.o., which, as the epidemic has
made clear, is to talk confidently about things they don't
understand.<br><br>An event like this is thus a uniquely powerful way of taking people's
measure. As Warren Buffett said, "It's only when the tide goes out
that you learn who's been swimming naked." And the tide has just
gone out like never before.<br><br>Now that we've seen the results, let's remember what we saw, because
this is the most accurate test of credibility we're ever likely to have.

<div><font size="2">
"Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions."<br><br>� Einstein
</font>

</font></div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br>
There has been a lot of talk about privilege lately. Although the
concept is overused, there is something to it, and in particular
to the idea that privilege makes you blind � that you can't see
things that are visible to someone whose life is very different
from yours.<br><br>But one of the most pervasive examples of this kind of blindness
is one that I haven't seen mentioned explicitly. I'm going to call
it <i>orthodox privilege</i>: The more conventional-minded someone is, the
more it seems to them that it's safe for everyone to express their
opinions.<br><br>It's safe for <i>them</i> to express their opinions, because the source
of their opinions is whatever it's currently acceptable to believe.
So it seems to them that it must be safe for everyone. They literally
can't imagine a true statement that would get you in trouble.<br><br>And yet at every point in history, there <a href="say.html"><u>were</u></a>
true things that would
get you in trouble to say. 
Is ours the first where this
isn't so? What an amazing coincidence that would be.<br><br>Surely it should at least be the default assumption that our time
is not unique, and that there are true things you can't say now,
just as there have always been. You would think. But even in the
face of such overwhelming historical evidence, most people will go
with their gut on this one.<br><br>In the most extreme cases, people suffering from orthodox
privilege will not only deny that there's anything true that 
you can't say, but will accuse you of heresy merely for saying there is. 
Though if there's more than one heresy current in
your time, these accusations will be weirdly non-deterministic:
you must either be an xist or a yist.<br><br>Frustrating as it is to deal with these people, it's important to
realize that they're in earnest. They're not pretending they think
it's impossible for an idea to be both unorthodox and true. The
world really looks that way to them.<br><br>Indeed, this is a uniquely tenacious form of privilege. People can
overcome the blindness induced by most forms of privilege by learning
more about whatever they're not. But they can't overcome orthodox
privilege just by learning more. They'd have to become more
independent-minded. If that happens at all, it doesn't happen on
the time scale of one conversation.<br><br>It may be possible to convince some people that orthodox privilege
must exist even though they can't sense it, just as one can with,
say, dark matter. There may be some who could be convinced, for
example, that it's very unlikely that this is the first point in
history at which there's nothing true you can't say, even if they
can't imagine specific examples.<br><br>But in general I don't think it will work to say
"check your privilege" about this type of privilege, because those
in its demographic don't realize they're in it. It doesn't seem to
conventional-minded people that they're conventional-minded. It
just seems to them that they're right. Indeed, they tend to be
particularly sure of it.<br><br>Perhaps the solution is to appeal to politeness. If someone says
they can hear a high-pitched noise that you can't, it's only polite
to take them at their word, instead of demanding evidence that's
impossible to produce, or simply denying that they hear anything.
Imagine how rude that would seem. Similarly, if someone says they
can think of things that are true but that cannot be said, it's
only polite to take them at their word, even if you can't think of
any yourself.
<!--
Once you realize that orthodox privilege exists, a lot of other
things become clearer. For example, how can it be that a large
number of reasonable, intelligent people worry about something they
call "cancel culture," while other reasonable, intelligent people
deny that it's a problem? Once you understand the concept of orthodox
privilege, it's easy to see the source of this disagreement.  If
you believe there's nothing true that you can't say, then anyone
who gets in trouble for something they say must deserve it. --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Antonio Garcia-Martinez,

and aggressiveness of their conformism. Imagine a Cartesian coordinate
system whose horizontal axis runs from conventional-minded on the
left to independent-minded on the right, and whose vertical axis
runs from passive at the bottom to aggressive at the top. The
resulting four quadrants define four types of people. Starting in
the upper left and going counter-clockwise: aggressively
conventional-minded, passively conventional-minded, passively
independent-minded, and aggressively independent-minded.<br><br>I think that you'll find all four types in most societies, and that
which quadrant people fall into depends more on their own personality
than the beliefs prevalent in their society.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Young children offer some of the best evidence for both points.
Anyone who's been to primary school has seen the four types, and
the fact that school rules are so arbitrary is strong evidence that
which quadrant people fall into depends more on them than the rules.<br><br>The kids in the upper left quadrant, the aggressively conventional-minded
ones, are the tattletales. They believe not only that rules must
be obeyed, but that those who disobey them must be punished.<br><br>The kids in the lower left quadrant, the passively conventional-minded,
are the sheep. They're careful to obey the rules, but when other
kids break them, their impulse is to worry that those kids will be
punished, not to ensure that they will.<br><br>The kids in the lower right quadrant, the passively independent-minded,
are the dreamy ones. They don't care much about rules and probably
aren't 100% sure what the rules even are.<br><br>And the kids in the upper right quadrant, the aggressively
independent-minded, are the naughty ones. When they see a rule,
their first impulse is to question it. Merely being told what to
do makes them inclined to do the opposite.<br><br>When measuring conformism, of course, you have to say with respect
to what, and this changes as kids get older. For younger kids it's
the rules set by adults. But as kids get older, the source of rules
becomes their peers. So a pack of teenagers who all flout school
rules in the same way are not independent-minded; rather the opposite.<br><br>In adulthood we can recognize the four types by their distinctive
calls, much as you could recognize four species of birds. The call
of the aggressively conventional-minded is "Crush &lt;outgroup&gt;!" (It's
rather alarming to see an exclamation point after a variable, but
that's the whole problem with the aggressively conventional-minded.)
The call of the passively conventional-minded is "What will the
neighbors think?" The call of the passively independent-minded is
"To each his own." And the call of the aggressively independent-minded
is "Eppur si muove."<br><br>The four types are not equally common. There are more passive people
than aggressive ones, and far more conventional-minded people than
independent-minded ones. So the passively conventional-minded are
the largest group, and the aggressively independent-minded the
smallest.<br><br>Since one's quadrant depends more on one's personality than the
nature of the rules, most people would occupy the same quadrant
even if they'd grown up in a quite different society.<br><br>Princeton professor Robert George recently wrote:
<blockquote>
   I sometimes ask students what their position on slavery would
   have been had they been white and living in the South before
   abolition. Guess what? They all would have been abolitionists!
   They all would have bravely spoken out against slavery, and
   worked tirelessly against it.
</blockquote>
He's too polite to say so, but of course they wouldn't. And indeed,
our default assumption should not merely be that his students would,
on average, have behaved the same way people did at the time, but
that the ones who are aggressively conventional-minded today would
have been aggressively conventional-minded then too. In other words,
that they'd not only not have fought against slavery, but that
they'd have been among its staunchest defenders.<br><br>I'm biased, I admit, but it seems to me that aggressively
conventional-minded people are responsible for a disproportionate
amount of the trouble in the world, and that a lot of the customs
we've evolved since the Enlightenment have been designed to protect
the rest of us from them. In particular, the retirement of the
concept of heresy and its replacement by the principle of freely
debating all sorts of different ideas, even ones that are currently
considered unacceptable, without any punishment for those who try
them out to see if they work.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Why do the independent-minded need to be protected, though? Because
they have all the new ideas. To be a successful scientist, for
example, it's not enough just to be right. You have to be right
when everyone else is wrong. Conventional-minded people can't do
that. For similar reasons, all successful startup CEOs are not
merely independent-minded, but aggressively so. So it's no coincidence
that societies prosper only to the extent that they have customs
for keeping the conventional-minded at bay.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>In the last few years, many of us have noticed that the customs
protecting free inquiry have been weakened. Some say we're overreacting
� that they haven't been weakened very much, or that they've been
weakened in the service of a greater good. The latter I'll dispose
of immediately. When the conventional-minded get the upper hand,
they always say it's in the service of a greater good.  It just
happens to be a different, incompatible greater good each time.<br><br>As for the former worry, that the independent-minded are being
oversensitive, and that free inquiry hasn't been shut down that
much, you can't judge that unless you are yourself independent-minded.
You can't know how much of the space of ideas is being lopped off
unless you have them, and only the independent-minded have the ones
at the edges. Precisely because of this, they tend to be very
sensitive to changes in how freely one can explore ideas. They're
the canaries in this coalmine.<br><br>The conventional-minded say, as they always do, that they don't
want to shut down the discussion of all ideas, just the bad ones.<br><br>You'd think it would be obvious just from that sentence what a
dangerous game they're playing. But I'll spell it out. There are
two reasons why we need to be able to discuss even "bad" ideas.<br><br>The first is that any process for deciding which ideas to ban is
bound to make mistakes. All the more so because no one intelligent
wants to undertake that kind of work, so it ends up being done by
the stupid. And when a process makes a lot of mistakes, you need
to leave a margin for error. Which in this case means you need to
ban fewer ideas than you'd like to. But that's hard for the
aggressively conventional-minded to do, partly because they enjoy
seeing people punished, as they have since they were children, and
partly because they compete with one another. Enforcers of orthodoxy
can't allow a borderline idea to exist, because that gives other
enforcers an opportunity to one-up them in the moral purity department,
and perhaps even to turn enforcer upon them. So instead of getting
the margin for error we need, we get the opposite: a race to the
bottom in which any idea that seems at all bannable ends up being
banned. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>The second reason it's dangerous to ban the discussion of ideas is
that ideas are more closely related than they look. Which means if
you restrict the discussion of some topics, it doesn't only affect
those topics. The restrictions propagate back into any topic that
yields implications in the forbidden ones. And that is not an edge
case. The best ideas do exactly that: they have consequences
in fields far removed from their origins. Having ideas in a world
where some ideas are banned is like playing soccer on a pitch that
has a minefield in one corner. You don't just play the same game
you would have, but on a different shaped pitch. You play a much
more subdued game even on the ground that's safe.<br><br>In the past, the way the independent-minded protected themselves
was to congregate in a handful of places �  first in courts, and
later in universities � where they could to some extent make their
own rules. Places where people work with ideas tend to have customs
protecting free inquiry, for the same reason wafer fabs have powerful
air filters, or recording studios good sound insulation. For the
last couple centuries at least, when the aggressively conventional-minded
were on the rampage for whatever reason, universities were the
safest places to be.<br><br>That may not work this time though, due to the unfortunate fact
that the latest wave of intolerance began in universities. It began
in the mid 1980s, and by 2000 seemed to have died down, but it has
recently flared up again with the arrival of social media. This
seems, unfortunately, to have been an own goal by Silicon Valley.
Though the people who run Silicon Valley are almost all independent-minded,
they've handed the aggressively conventional-minded a tool such as
they could only have dreamed of.<br><br>On the other hand, perhaps the decline in the spirit of free inquiry
within universities is as much the symptom of the departure of the
independent-minded as the cause. People who would have become
professors 50 years ago have other options now. Now they can become
quants or start startups. You have to be independent-minded to
succeed at either of those. If these people had been professors,
they'd have put up a stiffer resistance on behalf of academic
freedom. So perhaps the picture of the independent-minded fleeing
declining universities is too gloomy. Perhaps the universities are
declining because so many have already left.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#dddddd">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Though I've spent a lot of time thinking about this situation, I
can't predict how it plays out. Could some universities reverse the
current trend and remain places where the independent-minded want
to congregate? Or will the independent-minded gradually abandon
them? I worry a lot about what we might lose if that happened.<br><br>But I'm hopeful long term. The independent-minded are good at
protecting themselves. If existing institutions are compromised,
they'll create new ones. That may require some imagination. But
imagination is, after all, their specialty.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I realize of course that if people's personalities vary in any
two ways, you can use them as axes and call the resulting four
quadrants personality types. So what I'm really claiming is that
the axes are orthogonal and that there's significant variation in
both.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
The aggressively conventional-minded aren't responsible for all
the trouble in the world. Another big source of trouble is the sort
of charismatic leader who gains power by appealing to them. They
become much more dangerous when such leaders emerge.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
I never worried about writing things that offended the
conventional-minded when I was running Y Combinator. If YC were a
cookie company, I'd have faced a difficult moral choice.
Conventional-minded people eat cookies too. But they don't start
successful startups. So if I deterred them from applying to YC, the
only effect was to save us work reading applications.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
There has been progress in one area: the punishments for talking
about banned ideas are less severe than in the past. There's little
danger of being killed, at least in richer countries. The aggressively
conventional-minded are mostly satisfied with getting people fired.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Many professors are independent-minded � especially in math,
the hard sciences, and engineering, where you have to be to succeed.
But students are more representative of the general population, and
thus mostly conventional-minded. So when professors and students
are in conflict, it's not just a conflict between generations but
also between different types of people.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Nicholas Christakis, Patrick

to income and capital gains taxes. Let's try modeling the effects of various levels
of wealth tax to see what they would mean in practice for a startup
founder.<br><br>Suppose you start a successful startup in your twenties, and then
live for another 60 years. How much of your stock will a wealth tax
consume?<br><br>If the wealth tax applies to all your assets, it's easy to
calculate its effect. A wealth tax of 1% means you get to keep
99% of your stock each year. After 60 years the proportion
of stock you'll have left will be .99^60, or .547. So a
straight 1% wealth tax means the government will over the
course of your life take 45% of your stock.<br><br>(Losing shares does not, obviously, mean becoming <i>net</i>
poorer unless the value per share is increasing by less than the 
wealth tax rate.)<br><br>Here's how much stock the government would take over 60
years at various levels of wealth tax:<br><br><center>

A wealth tax will usually have a threshold at which it starts.
How much difference would a high threshold make? To model that,
we need to make some assumptions about the initial value of
your stock and the growth rate.<br><br>Suppose your stock is initially
worth $2 million, and the company's trajectory is as follows:
the value of your stock grows 3x for 2 years, then 2x for 2 years,
then 50% for 2 years, after
which you just get a typical public company growth rate,
which we'll call 8%. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font>
Suppose the wealth tax threshold is
$50 million. How much stock does the government take now?

It may at first seem surprising that such apparently small tax rates
produce such dramatic effects. A 2% wealth tax with a $50&nbsp;million
threshold takes about two thirds of a successful founder's stock.<br><br>The reason wealth taxes have such dramatic effects is that they're
applied over and over to the same money. Income tax
happens every year, but only to that year's income. Whereas if you
live for 60 years after acquiring some asset, a wealth tax will tax
that same asset 60 times. A wealth tax compounds.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Note</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
In practice, eventually some of this 8% would come in the form of 
dividends, which are taxed as income at issue, so this model actually
represents the most optimistic case for the founder.<br><br></font></p></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div>

is the fear of making something lame. And this fear is not an
irrational one. Many great projects go through a stage early on
where they don't seem very impressive, even to their creators. You
have to push through this stage to reach the great work that lies
beyond. But many people don't. Most people don't even reach the
stage of making something they're embarrassed by, let alone continue
past it. They're too frightened even to start.<br><br>Imagine if we could turn off the fear of making something lame.
Imagine how much more we'd do.<br><br>Is there any hope of turning it off? I think so. I think the habits
at work here are not very deeply rooted.<br><br>Making new things is itself a new thing for us as a species. It has
always happened, but till the last few centuries it happened so
slowly as to be invisible to individual humans. And since we didn't
need customs for dealing with new ideas, we didn't develop any.<br><br>We just don't have enough experience with early versions of ambitious
projects to know how to respond to them. We judge them as we would
judge more finished work, or less ambitious projects. We don't
realize they're a special case.<br><br>Or at least, most of us don't. One reason I'm confident we can do
better is that it's already starting to happen. There are already
a few places that are living in the future in this respect. Silicon
Valley is one of them: an unknown person working on a strange-sounding
idea won't automatically be dismissed the way they would back home.
In Silicon Valley, people have learned how dangerous that is.<br><br>The right way to deal with new ideas is to treat them as a challenge
to your imagination � not just to have lower standards, but to
<a href="altair.html"><u>switch polarity</u></a> entirely, from listing 
the reasons an idea won't
work to trying to think of ways it could. That's what I do when I
meet people with new ideas. I've become quite good at it, but I've
had a lot of practice. Being a partner at Y Combinator means being
practically immersed in strange-sounding ideas proposed by unknown
people. Every six months you get thousands of new ones thrown at
you and have to sort through them, knowing that in a world with a
power-law distribution of outcomes, it will be painfully obvious
if you miss the needle in this haystack. Optimism becomes
urgent.<br><br>But I'm hopeful that, with time, this kind of optimism can become
widespread enough that it becomes a social custom, not just a trick
used by a few specialists. It is after all an extremely lucrative
trick, and those tend to spread quickly.<br><br>Of course, inexperience is not the only reason people are too harsh
on early versions of ambitious projects. They also do it to seem
clever. And in a field where the new ideas are risky, like startups,
those who dismiss them are in fact more likely to be right. Just
not when their predictions are 
<a href="swan.html"><u>weighted by outcome</u></a>.<br><br>But there is another more sinister reason people dismiss new ideas.
If you try something ambitious, many of those around you will hope,
consciously or unconsciously, that you'll fail. They worry that if
you try something ambitious and succeed, it will put you above them.
In some countries this is not just an individual failing but part
of the national culture.<br><br>I wouldn't claim that people in Silicon Valley overcome these
impulses because they're morally better. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font>
The reason many hope
you'll succeed is that they hope to rise with you. For investors
this incentive is particularly explicit. They want you to succeed
because they hope you'll make them rich in the process. But many
other people you meet can hope to benefit in some way from your
success. At the very least they'll be able to say, when you're
famous, that they've known you since way back.<br><br>But even if Silicon Valley's encouraging attitude
is rooted in self-interest, it has over time actually grown into a
sort of benevolence. Encouraging startups has been practiced for
so long that it has become a custom. Now it just seems that that's
what one does with startups.<br><br>Maybe Silicon Valley is too optimistic. Maybe it's too easily fooled
by impostors. Many less optimistic journalists want to believe that.
But the lists of impostors they cite are suspiciously short, and
plagued with asterisks. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font> If you use revenue as the test, Silicon
Valley's optimism seems better tuned than the rest of the world's.
And because it works, it will spread.<br><br>There's a lot more to new ideas than new startup ideas, of course.
The fear of making something lame holds people back in every field.
But Silicon Valley shows how quickly customs can evolve to support
new ideas. And that in turn proves that dismissing new ideas is not
so deeply rooted in human nature that it can't be unlearnt.<br><br>
<center>___________</center><br><br>
Unfortunately, if you want to do new things, you'll face a force
more powerful than other people's skepticism: your own skepticism.
You too will judge your early work too harshly. How do you avoid
that?<br><br>This is a difficult problem, because you don't want to completely
eliminate your horror of making something lame. That's what steers
you toward doing good work. You just want to turn it off temporarily,
the way a painkiller temporarily turns off pain.<br><br>People have already discovered several techniques that work. Hardy
mentions two in <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>:
<blockquote>
  Good work is not done by "humble" men. It is one of the first
  duties of a professor, for example, in any subject, to exaggerate
  a little both the importance of his subject and his importance
  in it.
</blockquote>
If you overestimate the importance of what you're working on, that
will compensate for your mistakenly harsh judgment of your initial
results. If you look at something that's 20% of the way to a goal
worth 100 and conclude that it's 10% of the way to a goal worth
200, your estimate of its expected value is correct even though
both components are wrong.<br><br>It also helps, as Hardy suggests, to be slightly overconfident.
I've noticed in many fields that the most successful people are
slightly overconfident. On the face of it this seems implausible.
Surely it would be optimal to have exactly the right estimate of
one's abilities. How could it be an advantage to be mistaken?
Because this error compensates for other sources of error in the
opposite direction: being slightly overconfident armors you against
both other people's skepticism and your own.<br><br>Ignorance has a similar effect. It's safe to make the mistake of
judging early work as finished work if you're a sufficiently lax
judge of finished work. I doubt it's possible to cultivate this
kind of ignorance, but empirically it's a real advantage, especially
for the young.<br><br>Another way to get through the lame phase of ambitious projects is
to surround yourself with the right people � to create an eddy in
the social headwind. But it's not enough to collect people who are
always encouraging. You'd learn to discount that. You need colleagues
who can actually tell an ugly duckling from a baby swan. The people
best able to do this are those working on similar projects of their
own, which is why university departments and research labs work so
well. You don't need institutions to collect colleagues. They
naturally coalesce, given the chance. But it's very much worth
accelerating this process by seeking out other people trying to do
new things.<br><br>Teachers are in effect a special case of colleagues. It's a teacher's
job both to see the promise of early work and to encourage you to
continue. But teachers who are good at this are unfortunately quite
rare, so if you have the opportunity to learn from one, take it.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>For some it might work to rely on sheer discipline: to tell yourself
that you just have to press on through the initial crap phase and
not get discouraged. But like a lot of "just tell yourself" advice,
this is harder than it sounds. And it gets still harder as you get
older, because your standards rise. The old do have one compensating
advantage though: they've been through this before.<br><br>It can help if you focus less on where you are and more on the rate
of change. You won't worry so much about doing bad work if you can
see it improving. Obviously the faster it improves, the easier this
is. So when you start something new, it's good if you can spend a
lot of time on it. That's another advantage of being young: you
tend to have bigger blocks of time.<br><br>Another common trick is to start by considering new work to be of
a different, less exacting type. To start a painting saying that
it's just a sketch, or a new piece of software saying that it's
just a quick hack. Then you judge your initial results by a lower
standard. Once the project is rolling you can sneakily convert it
to something more.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>This will be easier if you use a medium that lets you work fast and
doesn't require too much commitment up front. It's easier to convince
yourself that something is just a sketch when you're drawing in a
notebook than when you're carving stone. Plus you get initial results
faster. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#dddddd">5</font></a>]</font>
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#dddddd">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>It will be easier to try out a risky project if you think of it as
a way to learn and not just as a way to make something. Then even
if the project truly is a failure, you'll still have gained by it.
If the problem is sharply enough defined, failure itself is
knowledge: if the theorem you're trying to prove turns out to
be false, or you use a structural member of a certain size and
it fails under stress, you've learned something, even if it
isn't what you wanted to learn.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#dddddd">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>One motivation that works particularly well for me is curiosity.
I like to try new things just to see how they'll turn out. We started
Y Combinator in this spirit, and it was one of main things that
kept me going while I was working on 
<a href="bel.html"><u>Bel</u></a>. Having worked for so long
with various dialects of Lisp, I was very curious to see what its
inherent shape was: what you'd end up with if you followed the
axiomatic approach all the way.<br><br>But it's a bit strange that you have to play mind games with yourself
to avoid being discouraged by lame-looking early efforts. The thing
you're trying to trick yourself into believing is in fact the truth.
A lame-looking early version of an ambitious project truly is more
valuable than it seems. So the ultimate solution may be to teach
yourself that.<br><br>One way to do it is to study the histories of people who've
done great work. What were they thinking early on? What was the
very first thing they did? It can sometimes be hard to get an
accurate answer to this question, because people are often embarrassed
by their earliest work and make little effort to publish it. (They
too misjudge it.) But when you can get an accurate picture of the
first steps someone made on the path to some great work, they're
often pretty feeble.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#dddddd">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>Perhaps if you study enough such cases, you can teach yourself to
be a better judge of early work. Then you'll be immune both to other
people's skepticism and your own fear of making something lame.
You'll see early work for what it is.<br><br>Curiously enough, the solution to the problem of judging early work
too harshly is to realize that our attitudes toward it are themselves
early work. Holding everything to the same standard is a crude
version 1. We're already evolving better customs, and we can already
see signs of how big the payoff will be.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This assumption may be too conservative. There is some evidence
that historically the Bay Area has attracted a 
<a href="cities.html"><u>different sort of person</u></a> than, 
say, New York City.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
One of their great favorites is Theranos. But the most conspicuous
feature of Theranos's cap table is the absence of Silicon Valley
firms. Journalists were fooled by Theranos, but Silicon Valley
investors weren't.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
I made two mistakes about teachers when I was younger.  I
cared more about professors' research than their reputations as
teachers, and I was also wrong about what it meant to be a good
teacher. I thought it simply meant to be good at explaining things.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Patrick Collison points out that you can go past treating
something as a hack in the sense of a prototype and onward to the
sense of the word that means something closer to a practical joke:
<blockquote>
  I think there may be something related to being a hack that can
  be powerful � the idea of making the tenuousness and implausibility
  <i>a feature</i>. "Yes, it's a bit ridiculous, right?  I'm just trying
  to see how far such a naive approach can get." YC seemed to me
  to have this characteristic.
</blockquote>
[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Much of the advantage of switching from physical to digital
media is not the software per se but that it lets you start something
new with little upfront commitment.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
John Carmack adds:
<blockquote>
  The value of a medium without a vast gulf between the early work
  and the final work is exemplified in game mods. The original
  Quake game was a golden age for mods, because everything was very
  flexible, but so crude due to technical limitations, that quick
  hacks to try out a gameplay idea weren't all <i>that</i> far from the
  official game. Many careers were born from that, but as the
  commercial game quality improved over the years, it became almost
  a full time job to make a successful mod that would be appreciated
  by the community. This was dramatically reversed with Minecraft
  and later Roblox, where the entire esthetic of the experience was
  so explicitly crude that innovative gameplay concepts became the
  overriding value. These "crude" game mods by single authors are
  now often bigger deals than massive professional teams' work.
</blockquote>
[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Lisa Randall suggests that we
<blockquote>
  treat new things as experiments. That way there's no such thing
  as failing, since you learn something no matter what. You treat
  it like an experiment in the sense that if it really rules something
  out, you give up and move on, but if there's some way to vary it
  to make it work better, go ahead and do that
</blockquote>
[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Michael Nielsen points out that the internet has made this
easier, because you can see programmers' first commits, musicians'
first videos, and so on.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, John Carmack, Patrick Collison, Jessica

differently from your peers. To be a successful scientist, for
example, it's not enough just to be correct. Your ideas have to be
both correct and novel. You can't publish papers saying things other
people already know. You need to say things no one else has realized
yet.<br><br>The same is true for investors. It's not enough for a public market
investor to predict correctly how a company will do. If a lot of
other people make the same prediction, the stock price will already
reflect it, and there's no room to make money. The only valuable
insights are the ones most other investors don't share.<br><br>You see this pattern with startup founders too. You don't want to
start a startup to do something that everyone agrees is a good idea,
or there will already be other companies doing it. You have to do
something that sounds to most other people like a bad idea, but
that you know isn't � like writing software for a tiny computer
used by a few thousand hobbyists, or starting a site to let people
rent airbeds on strangers' floors.<br><br>Ditto for essayists. An essay that told people things they already
knew would be boring. You have to tell them something <a href="useful.html"><u>new</u></a>.<br><br>But this pattern isn't universal. In fact, it doesn't hold for most
kinds of work. In most kinds of work � to be an administrator, for
example � all you need is the first half. All you need is to be
right. It's not essential that everyone else be wrong.<br><br>There's room for a little novelty in most kinds of work, but in
practice there's a fairly sharp distinction between the kinds of
work where it's essential to be independent-minded, and the kinds
where it's not.<br><br>I wish someone had told me about this distinction when I was a kid,
because it's one of the most important things to think about when
you're deciding what kind of work you want to do. Do you want to
do the kind of work where you can only win by thinking differently
from everyone else? I suspect most people's unconscious mind will
answer that question before their conscious mind has a chance to.
I know mine does.<br><br>Independent-mindedness seems to be more a matter of nature than
nurture. Which means if you pick the wrong type of work, you're
going to be unhappy. If you're naturally independent-minded, you're
going to find it frustrating to be a middle manager. And if you're
naturally conventional-minded, you're going to be sailing into a
headwind if you try to do original research.<br><br>One difficulty here, though, is that people are often mistaken about
where they fall on the spectrum from conventional- to independent-minded.
Conventional-minded people don't like to think of themselves as
conventional-minded. And in any case, it genuinely feels to them
as if they make up their own minds about everything. It's just a
coincidence that their beliefs are identical to their peers'. And
the independent-minded, meanwhile, are often unaware how different
their ideas are from conventional ones, at least till they state
them publicly.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>By the time they reach adulthood, most people know roughly how smart
they are (in the narrow sense of ability to solve pre-set problems),
because they're constantly being tested and ranked according to it.
But schools generally ignore independent-mindedness, except to the
extent they try to suppress it. So we don't get anything like the
same kind of feedback about how independent-minded we are.<br><br>There may even be a phenomenon like Dunning-Kruger at work, where
the most conventional-minded people are confident that they're
independent-minded, while the genuinely independent-minded worry
they might not be independent-minded enough.<br><br>
<center>___________</center><br><br>
Can you make yourself more independent-minded? I think so. This
quality may be largely inborn, but there seem to be ways to magnify
it, or at least not to suppress it.<br><br>One of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionally
by most nerds: simply to be less aware what conventional beliefs
are. It's hard to be a conformist if you don't know what you're
supposed to conform to. Though again, it may be that such people
already are independent-minded. A conventional-minded person would
probably feel anxious not knowing what other people thought, and
make more effort to find out.<br><br>It matters a lot who you surround yourself with. If you're surrounded
by conventional-minded people, it will constrain which ideas you
can express, and that in turn will constrain which ideas you have.
But if you surround yourself with independent-minded people, you'll
have the opposite experience: hearing other people say surprising
things will encourage you to, and to think of more.<br><br>Because the independent-minded find it uncomfortable to be surrounded
by conventional-minded people, they tend to self-segregate once
they have a chance to. The problem with high school is that they
haven't yet had a chance to. Plus high school tends to be an
inward-looking little world whose inhabitants lack confidence, both
of which magnify the forces of conformism.  So high school is
often a <a href="nerds.html"><u>bad time</u></a> for the
independent-minded. But there is some advantage even here: it
teaches you what to avoid. If you later find yourself in a situation
that makes you think "this is like high school," you know you should
get out.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another place where the independent- and conventional-minded are
thrown together is in successful startups. The founders and early
employees are almost always independent-minded; otherwise the startup
wouldn't be successful. But conventional-minded people greatly
outnumber independent-minded ones, so as the company grows, the
original spirit of independent-mindedness is inevitably diluted.
This causes all kinds of problems besides the obvious one that the
company starts to suck. One of the strangest is that the founders
find themselves able to speak more freely with founders of other
companies than with their own employees.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Fortunately you don't have to spend all your time with independent-minded
people. It's enough to have one or two you can talk to regularly.
And once you find them, they're usually as eager to talk as you
are; they need you too. Although universities no longer have the
kind of monopoly they used to have on education, good universities
are still an excellent way to meet independent-minded people. Most
students will still be conventional-minded, but you'll at least
find clumps of independent-minded ones, rather than the near zero
you may have found in high school.<br><br>It also works to go in the other direction: as well as cultivating
a small collection of independent-minded friends, to try to meet
as many different types of people as you can. It will decrease the
influence of your immediate peers if you have several other groups
of peers. Plus if you're part of several different worlds, you can
often import ideas from one to another.<br><br>But by different types of people, I don't mean demographically
different. For this technique to work, they have to think differently.
So while it's an excellent idea to go and visit other countries,
you can probably find people who think differently right around the
corner. When I meet someone who knows a lot about something unusual
(which includes practically everyone, if you dig deep enough), I
try to learn what they know that other people don't. There are
almost always surprises here. It's a good way to make conversation
when you meet strangers, but I don't do it to make conversation.
I really want to know.<br><br>You can expand the source of influences in time as well as space,
by reading history. When I read history I do it not just to learn
what happened, but to try to get inside the heads of people who
lived in the past. How did things look to them? This is hard to do,
but worth the effort for the same reason it's worth travelling far
to triangulate a point.<br><br>You can also take more explicit measures to prevent yourself from
automatically adopting conventional opinions. The most general is
to cultivate an attitude of skepticism. When you hear someone say
something, stop and ask yourself "Is that true?" Don't say it out
loud. I'm not suggesting that you impose on everyone who talks to
you the burden of proving what they say, but rather that you take
upon yourself the burden of evaluating what they say.<br><br>Treat it as a puzzle. You know that some accepted ideas will later
turn out to be wrong. See if you can guess which. The end goal is
not to find flaws in the things you're told, but to find the new
ideas that had been concealed by the broken ones. So this game
should be an exciting quest for novelty, not a boring protocol for
intellectual hygiene. And you'll be surprised, when you start asking
"Is this true?", how often the answer is not an immediate yes. If
you have any imagination, you're more likely to have too many leads
to follow than too few.<br><br>More generally your goal should be not to let anything into your
head unexamined, and things don't always enter your head in the
form of statements. Some of the most powerful influences are implicit.
How do you even notice these? By standing back and watching how
other people get their ideas.<br><br>When you stand back at a sufficient distance, you can see ideas
spreading through groups of people like waves. The most obvious are
in fashion: you notice a few people wearing a certain kind of shirt,
and then more and more, until half the people around you are wearing
the same shirt. You may not care much what you wear, but there are
intellectual fashions too, and you definitely don't want to participate
in those. Not just because you want sovereignty over your own
thoughts, but because <a href="nov.html"><u>unfashionable</u></a>
ideas are disproportionately likely to lead somewhere interesting.
The best place to find undiscovered ideas is where no one else is
looking.

<center>___________</center><br><br>
To go beyond this general advice, we need to look at the internal
structure of independent-mindedness � at the individual muscles
we need to exercise, as it were. It seems to me that it has three
components: fastidiousness about truth, resistance to being told
what to think, and curiosity.<br><br>Fastidiousness about truth means more than just not believing things
that are false. It means being careful about degree of belief. For
most people, degree of belief rushes unexamined toward the extremes:
the unlikely becomes impossible, and the probable becomes certain.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#dddddd">5</font></a>]</font>
To the independent-minded, this seems unpardonably sloppy.
They're willing to have anything in their heads, from highly
speculative hypotheses to (apparent) tautologies, but on subjects
they care about, everything has to be labelled with a carefully
considered degree of belief.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#dddddd">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>The independent-minded thus have a horror of ideologies, which
require one to accept a whole collection of beliefs at once, and
to treat them as articles of faith. To an independent-minded person
that would seem revolting, just as it would seem to someone fastidious
about food to take a bite of a submarine sandwich filled with a
large variety of ingredients of indeterminate age and provenance.<br><br>Without this fastidiousness about truth, you can't be truly
independent-minded. It's not enough just to have resistance to being
told what to think. Those kind of people reject conventional ideas
only to replace them with the most random conspiracy theories. And
since these conspiracy theories have often been manufactured to
capture them, they end up being less independent-minded than ordinary
people, because they're subject to a much more exacting master than
mere convention.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#dddddd">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Can you increase your fastidiousness about truth? I would think so.
In my experience, merely thinking about something you're fastidious
about causes that fastidiousness to grow. If so, this is one of
those rare virtues we can have more of merely by wanting it. And
if it's like other forms of fastidiousness, it should also be
possible to encourage in children. I certainly got a strong dose
of it from my father.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#dddddd">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>The second component of independent-mindedness, resistance to being
told what to think, is the most visible of the three. But even this
is often misunderstood. The big mistake people make about it is to
think of it as a merely negative quality. The language we use
reinforces that idea. You're <i>un</i>conventional. You <i>don't</i> care
what other people think. But it's not just a kind of immunity. In
the most independent-minded people, the desire not to be told what
to think is a positive force. It's not mere skepticism, but an
active <a href="gba.html"><u>delight</u></a> in ideas that subvert
the conventional wisdom, the more counterintuitive the better.<br><br>Some of the most novel ideas seemed at the time almost like practical
jokes. Think how often your reaction to a novel idea is to laugh.
I don't think it's because novel ideas are funny per se, but because
novelty and humor share a certain kind of surprisingness. But while
not identical, the two are close enough that there is a definite
correlation between having a sense of humor and being independent-minded
� just as there is between being humorless and being conventional-minded.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#dddddd">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>I don't think we can significantly increase our resistance to being
told what to think. It seems the most innate of the three components
of independent-mindedness; people who have this quality as adults
usually showed all too visible signs of it as children. But if we
can't increase our resistance to being told what to think, we can
at least shore it up, by surrounding ourselves with other
independent-minded people.<br><br>The third component of independent-mindedness, curiosity, may be
the most interesting. To the extent that we can give a brief answer
to the question of where novel ideas come from, it's curiosity. That's
what people are usually feeling before having them.<br><br>In my experience, independent-mindedness and curiosity predict one
another perfectly. Everyone I know who's independent-minded is
deeply curious, and everyone I know who's conventional-minded isn't.
Except, curiously, children. All small children are curious. Perhaps
the reason is that even the conventional-minded have to be curious
in the beginning, in order to learn what the conventions are. Whereas
the independent-minded are the gluttons of curiosity, who keep
eating even after they're full.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#dddddd">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>The three components of independent-mindedness work in concert:
fastidiousness about truth and resistance to being told what to
think leave space in your brain, and curiosity finds new ideas to
fill it.<br><br>Interestingly, the three components can substitute for one another
in much the same way muscles can. If you're sufficiently fastidious
about truth, you don't need to be as resistant to being told what
to think, because fastidiousness alone will create sufficient gaps
in your knowledge. And either one can compensate for curiosity,
because if you create enough space in your brain, your discomfort
at the resulting vacuum will add force to your curiosity. Or curiosity
can compensate for them: if you're sufficiently curious, you don't
need to clear space in your brain, because the new ideas you discover
will push out the conventional ones you acquired by default.<br><br>Because the components of independent-mindedness are so interchangeable,
you can have them to varying degrees and still get the same result.
So there is not just a single model of independent-mindedness. Some
independent-minded people are openly subversive, and others are
quietly curious. They all know the secret handshake though.<br><br>Is there a way to cultivate curiosity? To start with, you want to
avoid situations that suppress it. How much does the work you're
currently doing engage your curiosity? If the answer is "not much,"
maybe you should change something.<br><br>The most important active step you can take to cultivate your
curiosity is probably to seek out the topics that engage it. Few
adults are equally curious about everything, and it doesn't seem
as if you can choose which topics interest you. So it's up to you
to <a href="genius.html"><u>find</u></a> them. Or invent them, if
necessary.<br><br>Another way to increase your curiosity is to indulge it, by
investigating things you're interested in. Curiosity is unlike
most other appetites in this respect: indulging it tends to increase
rather than to sate it. Questions lead to more questions.<br><br>Curiosity seems to be more individual than fastidiousness about
truth or resistance to being told what to think. To the degree
people have the latter two, they're usually pretty general, whereas
different people can be curious about very different things. So
perhaps curiosity is the compass here. Perhaps, if your goal is to
discover novel ideas, your motto should not be "do what you love"
so much as "do what you're curious about."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
One convenient consequence of the fact that no one identifies
as conventional-minded is that you can say what you like about
conventional-minded people without getting in too much trouble.
When I wrote <a href="conformism.html"><u>"The Four Quadrants of
Conformism"</u></a> I expected a firestorm of rage from the
aggressively conventional-minded, but in fact it was quite muted.
They sensed that there was something about the essay that they
disliked intensely, but they had a hard time finding a specific
passage to pin it on.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
When I ask myself what in my life is like high school, the
answer is Twitter. It's not just full of conventional-minded people,
as anything its size will inevitably be, but subject to violent
storms of conventional-mindedness that remind me of descriptions
of Jupiter. But while it probably is a net loss to spend time there,
it has at least made me think more about the distinction between
independent- and conventional-mindedness, which I probably wouldn't
have done otherwise.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The decrease in independent-mindedness in growing startups is
still an open problem, but there may be solutions.<br><br>Founders can delay the problem by making a conscious effort only
to hire independent-minded people. Which of course also has the
ancillary benefit that they have better ideas.<br><br>Another possible solution is to create policies that somehow disrupt
the force of conformism, much as control rods slow chain reactions,
so that the conventional-minded aren't as dangerous. The physical
separation of Lockheed's Skunk Works may have had this as a side
benefit. Recent examples suggest employee forums like Slack may not
be an unmitigated good.<br><br>The most radical solution would be to grow revenues without growing
the company. You think hiring that junior PR person will be cheap,
compared to a programmer, but what will be the effect on the average
level of independent-mindedness in your company? (The growth in
staff relative to faculty seems to have had a similar effect on
universities.) Perhaps the rule about outsourcing work that's not
your "core competency" should be augmented by one about outsourcing
work done by people who'd ruin your culture as employees.<br><br>Some investment firms already seem to be able to grow revenues
without growing the number of employees. Automation plus the ever
increasing articulation of the "tech stack" suggest this may one
day be possible for product companies.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
There are intellectual fashions in every field, but their
influence varies. One of the reasons politics, for example, tends
to be boring is that it's so extremely subject to them. The threshold
for having opinions about politics is much <a href="identity.html"><u>lower</u></a> than the one for having
opinions about set theory. So while there are some ideas in politics,
in practice they tend to be swamped by waves of intellectual fashion.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
The conventional-minded are often fooled by the strength of
their opinions into believing that they're independent-minded. But
strong convictions are not a sign of independent-mindedness. Rather
the opposite.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Fastidiousness about truth doesn't imply that an independent-minded
person won't be dishonest, but that he won't be deluded. It's sort
of like the definition of a gentleman as someone who is never
unintentionally rude.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
You see this especially among political extremists. They think
themselves nonconformists, but actually they're niche conformists.
Their opinions may be different from the average person's, but they
are often more influenced by their peers' opinions than the average
person's are.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
If we broaden the concept of fastidiousness about truth so that
it excludes pandering, bogusness, and pomposity as well as falsehood
in the strict sense, our model of independent-mindedness can expand
further into the arts.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
This correlation is far from perfect, though. G�del and Dirac
don't seem to have been very strong in the humor department. But
someone who is both "neurotypical" and humorless is very likely to
be conventional-minded.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
Exception: gossip. Almost everyone is curious about gossip.<br><br><br><br>

it might be useful to explain what was special about Airbnb.<br><br>What was special about the Airbnbs was how earnest they were. They
did nothing half-way, and we could sense this even in the interview.
Sometimes after we interviewed a startup we'd be uncertain what to
do, and have to talk it over. Other times we'd just look at one
another and smile. The Airbnbs' interview was that kind. We didn't
even like the idea that much. Nor did users, at that stage; they
had no growth. But the founders seemed so full of energy that it
was impossible not to like them.<br><br>That first impression was not misleading. During the batch our
nickname for Brian Chesky was The Tasmanian Devil, because like the
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StG2u5qfFRg&amp;t=2m27s">cartoon
character</a> he seemed a tornado of energy. All three of them were
like that. No one ever worked harder during YC than the Airbnbs
did. When you talked to the Airbnbs, they took notes. If you suggested
an idea to them in office hours, the next time you talked to them
they'd not only have implemented it, but also implemented two new
ideas they had in the process. "They probably have the best attitude
of any startup we've funded" I wrote to Mike Arrington during the
batch.<br><br>They're still like that. Jessica and I had dinner with Brian in the
summer of 2018, just the three of us. By this point the company is
ten years old. He took a page of notes about ideas for new things
Airbnb could do.<br><br>What we didn't realize when we first met Brian and Joe and Nate was
that Airbnb was on its last legs. After working on the company for
a year and getting no growth, they'd agreed to give it one last
shot. They'd try this Y Combinator thing, and if the company still
didn't take off, they'd give up.<br><br>Any normal person would have given up already. They'd been funding
the company with credit cards. They had a <i>binder</i> full of
credit cards they'd maxed out. Investors didn't think much of the
idea. One investor they met in a cafe walked out in the middle of
meeting with them. They thought he was going to the bathroom, but
he never came back. "He didn't even finish his smoothie," Brian
said. And now, in late 2008, it was the worst recession in decades.
The stock market was in free fall and wouldn't hit bottom for another
four months.<br><br>Why hadn't they given up? This is a useful question to ask. People,
like matter, reveal their nature under extreme conditions. One thing
that's clear is that they weren't doing this just for the money.
As a money-making scheme, this was pretty lousy: a year's work and
all they had to show for it was a binder full of maxed-out credit
cards. So why were they still working on this startup? Because of
the experience they'd had as the first hosts.<br><br>When they first tried renting out airbeds on their floor during a
design convention, all they were hoping for was to make enough money
to pay their rent that month. But something surprising happened:
they enjoyed having those first three guests staying with them. And
the guests enjoyed it too. Both they and the guests had done it
because they were in a sense forced to, and yet they'd all had a
great experience. Clearly there was something new here: for hosts,
a new way to make money that had literally been right under their
noses, and for guests, a new way to travel that was in many ways
better than hotels.<br><br>That experience was why the Airbnbs didn't give up. They knew they'd
discovered something. They'd seen a glimpse of the future, and they
couldn't let it go.<br><br>They knew that once people tried staying in what is now called "an
airbnb," they would also realize that this was the future. But only
if they tried it, and they weren't. That was the problem during Y
Combinator: to get growth started.<br><br>Airbnb's goal during YC was to reach what we call <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html">ramen profitability</a>,
which means making enough money that the company can pay the founders'
living expenses, if they live on ramen noodles. Ramen profitability
is not, obviously, the end goal of any startup, but it's the most
important threshold on the way, because this is the point where
you're airborne. This is the point where you no longer need investors'
permission to continue existing. For the Airbnbs, ramen profitability
was $4000 a month: $3500 for rent, and $500 for food. They taped
this goal to the mirror in the bathroom of their apartment.<br><br>The way to get growth started in something like Airbnb is to focus
on the hottest subset of the market. If you can get growth started
there, it will spread to the rest. When I asked the Airbnbs where
there was most demand, they knew from searches: New York City. So
they focused on New York. They went there <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">in person</a> to visit their
hosts and help them make their listings more attractive. A big part
of that was better pictures. So Joe and Brian rented a professional
camera and took pictures of the hosts' places themselves.<br><br>This didn't just make the listings better. It also taught them about
their hosts. When they came back from their first trip to New York,
I asked what they'd noticed about hosts that surprised them, and
they said the biggest surprise was how many of the hosts were in
the same position they'd been in: they needed this money to pay
their rent. This was, remember, the worst recession in decades, and
it had hit New York first. It definitely added to the Airbnbs' sense
of mission to feel that people needed them.<br><br>In late January 2009, about three weeks into Y Combinator, their
efforts started to show results, and their numbers crept upward.
But it was hard to say for sure whether it was growth or just random
fluctuation. By February it was clear that it was real growth. They
made $460 in fees in the first week of February, $897 in the second,
and $1428 in the third. That was it: they were airborne. Brian sent
me an email on February 22 announcing that they were ramen profitable
and giving the last three weeks' numbers.<br><br>"I assume you know what you've now set yourself up for next week,"
I responded.<br><br>Brian's reply was seven words: "We are not going to slow down."<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

that two separate essays I'd been planning to write were actually
the same.<br><br>The first is about how to ace your Y Combinator interview. There
has been so much nonsense written about this topic that I've been
meaning for years to write something telling founders the truth.<br><br>The second is about something politicians sometimes say � that the
only way to become a billionaire is by exploiting people � and why
this is mistaken.<br><br>Keep reading, and you'll learn both simultaneously.<br><br>I know the politicians are mistaken because it was my job to predict
which people will become billionaires. I think I can truthfully say
that I know as much about how to do this as anyone. If the key to
becoming a billionaire � the defining feature of billionaires �
was to exploit people, then I, as a professional billionaire scout,
would surely realize this and look for people who would be good at
it, just as an NFL scout looks for speed in wide receivers.<br><br>But aptitude for exploiting people is not what Y Combinator looks
for at all. In fact, it's the opposite of what they look for. I'll
tell you what they do look for, by explaining how to convince 
Y&nbsp;Combinator to fund you, and you can see for yourself.<br><br>What YC looks for, above all, is founders who understand some group
of users and can make what they want. This is so important that
it's YC's motto: "Make something people want."<br><br>A big company can to some extent force unsuitable products on
unwilling customers, but a startup doesn't have the power to do
that. A startup must sing for its supper, by making things that
genuinely delight its customers. Otherwise it will never get off
the ground.<br><br>Here's where things get difficult, both for you as a founder and
for the YC partners trying to decide whether to fund you. In a
market economy, it's hard to make something people want that they
don't already have. That's the great thing about market economies.
If other people both knew about this need and were able to satisfy
it, they already would be, and there would be no room for your
startup.<br><br>Which means the conversation during your YC interview will have to
be about something new: either a new need, or a new way to satisfy
one. And not just new, but uncertain. If it were certain that the
need existed and that you could satisfy it, that certainty would
be reflected in large and rapidly growing revenues, and you wouldn't
be seeking seed funding.<br><br>So the YC partners have to guess both whether you've discovered a
real need, and whether you'll be able to satisfy it. That's what they
are, at least in this part of their job: professional guessers.
They have 1001 heuristics for doing this, and I'm not going to tell
you all of them, but I'm happy to tell you the most important ones,
because these can't be faked; the only way to "hack" them would be
to do what you should be doing anyway as a founder.<br><br>The first thing the partners will try to figure out, usually, is
whether what you're making will ever be something a lot of people
want. It doesn't have to be something a lot of people want now.
The product and the market will both evolve, and will influence
each other's evolution. But in the end there has to be something
with a huge market. That's what the partners will be trying to
figure out: is there a path to a huge market?
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Sometimes it's obvious there will be a huge market. If 
<a href="https://boomsupersonic.com/"><u>Boom</u></a> manages
to ship an airliner at all, international airlines will have to buy
it. But usually it's not obvious. Usually the path to a huge market
is by growing a small market. This idea is important enough that
it's worth coining a phrase for, so let's call one of these small
but growable markets a "larval market."<br><br>The perfect example of a larval market might be Apple's market when
they were founded in 1976. In 1976, not many people wanted their
own computer. But more and more started to want one, till now every
10 year old on the planet wants a computer (but calls it a "phone").<br><br>The ideal combination is the group of founders who are 
<a href="startupideas.html"><u>"living in
the future"</u></a> in the sense of being at the leading edge of some kind
of change, and who are building something they themselves want.
Most super-successful startups are of this type. Steve Wozniak
wanted a computer. Mark Zuckerberg wanted to engage online with his
college friends. Larry and Sergey wanted to find things on the web.
All these founders were building things they and their peers wanted,
and the fact that they were at the leading edge of change meant
that more people would want these things in the future.<br><br>But although the ideal larval market is oneself and one's peers,
that's not the only kind. A larval market might also be regional,
for example. You build something to serve one location, and then
expand to others.<br><br>The crucial feature of the initial market is that it exist. That
may seem like an obvious point, but the lack of it is the biggest
flaw in most startup ideas. There have to be some people who want
what you're building right now, and want it so urgently that they're
willing to use it, bugs and all, even though you're a small company
they've never heard of. There don't have to be many, but there have
to be some. As long as you have some users, there are straightforward
ways to get more: build new features they want, seek out more people
like them, get them to refer you to their friends, and so on. But
these techniques all require some initial seed group of users.<br><br>So this is one thing the YC partners will almost certainly dig into
during your interview. Who are your first users going to be, and
how do you know they want this? If I had to decide whether to fund
startups based on a single question, it would be "How do you know
people want this?"<br><br>The most convincing answer is "Because we and our friends want it."
It's even better when this is followed by the news that you've
already built a prototype, and even though it's very crude, your
friends are using it, and it's spreading by word of mouth. If you
can say that and you're not lying, the partners will switch from
default no to default yes. Meaning you're in unless there's some
other disqualifying flaw.<br><br>That is a hard standard to meet, though. Airbnb didn't meet it.
They had the first part. They had made something they themselves
wanted. But it wasn't spreading. So don't feel bad if you don't hit
this gold standard of convincingness. If Airbnb didn't hit it, it
must be too high.<br><br>In practice, the YC partners will be satisfied if they feel that
you have a deep understanding of your users' needs. And the Airbnbs
did have that. They were able to tell us all about what motivated
hosts and guests. They knew from first-hand experience, because
they'd been the first hosts. We couldn't ask them a question they
didn't know the answer to. We ourselves were not very excited about
the idea as users, but we knew this didn't prove anything, because
there were lots of successful startups we hadn't been excited about
as users. We were able to say to ourselves "They seem to know what
they're talking about. Maybe they're onto something. It's not growing
yet, but maybe they can figure out how to make it grow during YC."
Which they did, about three weeks into the batch.<br><br>The best thing you can do in a YC interview is to teach the partners
about your users. So if you want to prepare for your interview, one of the best 
ways to do it is to go talk to your users and find out exactly what
they're thinking. Which is what you should be doing anyway.<br><br>This may sound strangely credulous, but the YC partners want to
rely on the founders to tell them about the market. Think about
how VCs typically judge the potential market for an idea. They're
not ordinarily domain experts themselves, so they forward the idea
to someone who is, and ask for their opinion. YC doesn't have time
to do this, but if the YC partners can convince themselves that the
founders both (a) know what they're talking about and (b) aren't
lying, they don't need outside domain experts. They can use the
founders themselves as domain experts when evaluating their own
idea.<br><br>This is why YC interviews aren't pitches. To give as many founders
as possible a chance to get funded, we made interviews as short as
we could: 10 minutes. That is not enough time for the partners to
figure out, through the indirect evidence in a pitch, whether you
know what you're talking about and aren't lying. They need to dig
in and ask you questions. There's not enough time for sequential
access. They need random access.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The worst advice I ever heard about how to succeed in a YC interview
is that you should take control of the interview and make sure to
deliver the message you want to. In other words, turn the interview
into a pitch. ⟨elaborate expletive⟩. It is so annoying when people
try to do that. You ask them a question, and instead of answering
it, they deliver some obviously prefabricated blob of pitch. It
eats up 10 minutes really fast.<br><br>There is no one who can give you accurate advice about what to do
in a YC interview except a current or former YC partner. People
who've merely been interviewed, even successfully, have no idea of
this, but interviews take all sorts of different forms depending
on what the partners want to know about most. Sometimes they're all
about the founders, other times they're all about the idea. Sometimes
some very narrow aspect of the idea. Founders sometimes walk away
from interviews complaining that they didn't get to explain their
idea completely. True, but they explained enough.<br><br>Since a YC interview consists of questions, the way to do it well
is to answer them well. Part of that is answering them candidly.
The partners don't expect you to know everything. But if you don't
know the answer to a question, don't try to bullshit your way out
of it. The partners, like most experienced investors, are professional
bullshit detectors, and you are (hopefully) an amateur bullshitter.
And if you try to bullshit them and fail, they may not even tell
you that you failed. So it's better to be honest than to try to
sell them. If you don't know the answer to a question, say you
don't, and tell them how you'd go about finding it, or tell them
the answer to some related question.<br><br>If you're asked, for example, what could go wrong, the worst possible
answer is "nothing." Instead of convincing them that your idea is
bullet-proof, this will convince them that you're a fool or a liar.
Far better to go into gruesome detail. That's what experts do when
you ask what could go wrong.  The partners know that your idea is
risky. That's what a good bet looks like at this stage: a tiny
probability of a huge outcome.<br><br>Ditto if they ask about competitors. Competitors are rarely what
kills startups. Poor execution does. But you should know who your
competitors are, and tell the YC partners candidly what your relative
strengths and weaknesses are. Because the YC partners know that
competitors don't kill startups, they won't hold competitors against
you too much. They will, however, hold it against you if you seem
either to be unaware of competitors, or to be minimizing the threat
they pose. They may not be sure whether you're clueless or lying,
but they don't need to be.<br><br>The partners don't expect your idea to be perfect. This is seed
investing. At this stage, all they can expect are promising hypotheses.
But they do expect you to be thoughtful and honest. So if trying
to make your idea seem perfect causes you to come off as glib or
clueless, you've sacrificed something you needed for something you
didn't.<br><br>If the partners are sufficiently convinced that there's a path to
a big market, the next question is whether you'll be able to find
it. That in turn depends on three things: the general qualities of
the founders, their specific expertise in this domain, and the
relationship between them. How determined are the founders? Are
they good at building things? Are they resilient enough to keep
going when things go wrong? How strong is their friendship?<br><br>Though the Airbnbs only did ok in the idea department, they did
spectacularly well in this department. The story of how they'd
funded themselves by making Obama- and McCain-themed breakfast
cereal was the single most important factor in our decision to fund
them. They didn't realize it at the time, but what seemed to them
an irrelevant story was in fact fabulously good evidence of their
qualities as founders. It showed they were resourceful and determined,
and could work together.<br><br>It wasn't just the cereal story that showed that, though. The whole
interview showed that they cared. They weren't doing this just for
the money, or because startups were cool. The reason they were
working so hard on this company was because it was their project.
They had discovered an interesting new idea, and they just couldn't
let it go.<br><br>Mundane as it sounds, that's the most powerful motivator of all,
not just in startups, but in most ambitious undertakings: to be
<a href="genius.html"><u>genuinely interested</u></a> in what 
you're building. This is what really
drives billionaires, or at least the ones who become billionaires
from starting companies. The company is their project.<br><br>One thing few people realize about billionaires is that all of them
could have stopped sooner. They could have gotten acquired, or found
someone else to run the company. Many founders do. The ones who
become really rich are the ones who keep working. And what makes
them keep working is not just money. What keeps them working is the
same thing that keeps anyone else working when they could stop if
they wanted to: that there's nothing else they'd rather do.<br><br>That, not exploiting people, is the defining quality of people who
become billionaires from starting companies. So that's what YC looks
for in founders: authenticity. People's motives for starting startups
are usually mixed. They're usually doing it from some combination
of the desire to make money, the desire to seem cool, genuine
interest in the problem, and unwillingness to work for someone else.
The last two are more powerful motivators than the first two. It's
ok for founders to want to make money or to seem cool. Most do.
But if the founders seem like they're doing it <i>just</i> to make money
or <i>just</i> to seem cool, they're not likely to succeed on a big
scale. The founders who are doing it for the money will take the
first sufficiently large acquisition offer, and the ones who are
doing it to seem cool will rapidly discover that there are much
less painful ways of seeming cool.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Y Combinator certainly sees founders whose m.o. is to exploit people.
YC is a magnet for them, because they want the YC brand. But when
the YC partners detect someone like that, they reject them. If bad
people made good founders, the YC partners would face a moral
dilemma. Fortunately they don't, because bad people make bad founders.
This exploitative type of founder is not going to succeed on a large
scale, and in fact probably won't even succeed on a small one,
because they're always going to be taking shortcuts. They see YC
itself as a shortcut.<br><br>Their exploitation usually begins with their own cofounders, which
is disastrous, since the cofounders' relationship is the foundation
of the company. Then it moves on to the users, which is also
disastrous, because the sort of early adopters a successful startup
wants as its initial users are the hardest to fool. The best this
kind of founder can hope for is to keep the edifice of deception
tottering along until some acquirer can be tricked into buying it.
But that kind of acquisition is never very big.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>If professional billionaire scouts know that exploiting people is
not the skill to look for, why do some politicians think this is
the defining quality of billionaires?<br><br>I think they start from the feeling that it's wrong that one person
could have so much more money than another. It's understandable
where that feeling comes from. It's in our DNA, and even in the DNA
of other species.<br><br>If they limited themselves to saying that it made them feel bad
when one person had so much more money than other people, who would
disagree? It makes me feel bad too, and I think people who make a
lot of money have a moral obligation to use it for the common good.
The mistake they make is to jump from feeling bad that some people
are much richer than others to the conclusion that there's no
legitimate way to make a very large amount of money. Now we're
getting into statements that are not only falsifiable, but false.<br><br>There are certainly some people who become rich by doing bad things.
But there are also plenty of people who behave badly and don't make
that much from it. There is no correlation � in fact, probably an
inverse correlation � between how badly you behave and how much
money you make.<br><br>The greatest danger of this nonsense may not even be that it sends
policy astray, but that it misleads ambitious people. Can you imagine
a better way to destroy social mobility than by telling poor kids
that the way to get rich is by exploiting people, while the rich
kids know, from having watched the preceding generation do it, how
it's really done?<br><br>I'll tell you how it's really done, so you can at least tell your
own kids the truth. It's all about users. The most reliable way to
become a billionaire is to start a company that 
<a href="growth.html"><u>grows fast</u></a>, and the
way to grow fast is to make what users want. Newly started startups
have no choice but to delight users, or they'll never even get
rolling. But this never stops being the lodestar, and bigger companies
take their eye off it at their peril. Stop delighting users, and
eventually someone else will.<br><br>Users are what the partners want to
know about in YC interviews, and what I want to know about when I
talk to founders that we funded ten years ago and who are billionaires
now. What do users want? What new things could you build for them?
Founders who've become billionaires are always eager to talk about
that topic. That's how they became billionaires.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
The YC partners have so much practice doing this that they
sometimes see paths that the founders themselves haven't seen yet.
The partners don't try to seem skeptical, as buyers in transactions
often do to increase their leverage. Although the founders feel
their job is to convince the partners of the potential of their
idea, these roles are not infrequently reversed, and the founders
leave the interview feeling their idea has more potential than they
realized.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
In practice, 7 minutes would be enough. You rarely change your
mind at minute 8. But 10 minutes is socially convenient.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
I myself took the first sufficiently large acquisition offer
in my first startup, so I don't blame founders for doing this.
There's nothing wrong with starting a startup to make money. You
need to make money somehow, and for some people startups are the
most efficient way to do it. I'm just saying that these are not the
startups that get really big.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Not these days, anyway. There were some big ones during the
Internet Bubble, and indeed some big IPOs.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Geoff Ralston, and

when we're talking about startups. The highest compliment we can
pay to founders is to describe them as "earnest." This is not by
itself a guarantee of success. You could be earnest but incapable.
But when founders are both formidable (another of our words) and
earnest, they're as close to unstoppable as you get.<br><br>Earnestness sounds like a boring, even Victorian virtue. It seems
a bit of an anachronism that people in Silicon Valley would care
about it. Why does this matter so much?<br><br>When you call someone earnest, you're making a statement about their
motives. It means both that they're doing something for the right
reasons, and that they're trying as hard as they can. If we imagine
motives as vectors, it means both the direction and the magnitude
are right. Though these are of course related: when people are doing
something for the right reasons, they try harder.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The reason motives matter so much in Silicon Valley is that so many
people there have the wrong ones. Starting a successful startup
makes you rich and famous. So a lot of the people trying to start
them are doing it for those reasons. Instead of what? Instead of
interest in the problem for its own sake. That is the root of
earnestness. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>It's also the hallmark of a nerd. Indeed, when people describe
themselves as "x nerds," what they mean is that they're interested
in x for its own sake, and not because it's cool to be interested
in x, or because of what they can get from it. They're saying they
care so much about x that they're willing to sacrifice seeming cool
for its sake.<br><br>A <a href="genius.html"><u>genuine interest</u></a> 
in something is a very powerful motivator � for
some people, the most powerful motivator of all.

Which is why
it's what Jessica and I look for in founders. But as well as being
a source of strength, it's also a source of vulnerability. Caring
constrains you. The earnest can't easily reply in kind to mocking
banter, or put on a cool facade of nihil admirari. They care too
much. They are doomed to be the straight man. That's a real
disadvantage in your 
<a href="nerds.html"><u>teenage years</u></a>, 
when mocking banter and nihil
admirari often have the upper hand. But it becomes an advantage
later.<br><br>It's a commonplace now that the kids who were 
nerds in high school
become the cool kids' bosses later on. But people misunderstand why
this happens. It's not just because the nerds are smarter, but also
because they're more earnest. When the problems get harder than the
fake ones you're given in high school, caring about them starts to
matter.<br><br>Does it always matter? Do the earnest always win? Not always. It
probably doesn't matter much in politics, or in crime, or in certain
types of business that are similar to crime, like gambling, personal
injury law, patent trolling, and so on. Nor does it matter in
academic fields at the more 
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=hermeneutic+dialectics+hegemonic+phenomenology+intersectionality"><u>bogus</u></a> end of the spectrum. And though
I don't know enough to say for sure, it may not matter in some kinds
of humor: it may be possible to be completely cynical and still be
very funny.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Looking at the list of fields I mentioned, there's an obvious
pattern. Except possibly for humor, these are all types of work I'd
avoid like the plague. So that could be a useful heuristic for
deciding which fields to work in: how much does earnestness matter?
Which can in turn presumably be inferred from the prevalence of
nerds at the top.<br><br>Along with "nerd," another word that tends to be associated with
earnestness is "naive." The earnest often seem naive.  It's not
just that they don't have the motives other people have. They often
don't fully grasp that such motives exist. Or they may know
intellectually that they do, but because they don't feel them, they
forget about them.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#dddddd">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>It works to be slightly naive not just about motives but also,
believe it or not, about the problems you're working on. Naive
optimism can compensate for the bit rot that 
<a href="ecw.html"><u>rapid change</u></a> causes
in established beliefs. You plunge into some problem saying "How
hard can it be?", and then after solving it you learn that it was
till recently insoluble.<br><br>Naivete is an obstacle for anyone who wants to seem sophisticated,
and this is one reason would-be intellectuals find it so difficult
to understand Silicon Valley. It hasn't been safe for such people
to use the word "earnest" outside scare quotes since Oscar Wilde
wrote "The Importance of Being Earnest" in 1895. And yet when you
zoom in on Silicon Valley, right into 
<a href="jessica.html"><u>Jessica Livingston's brain</u></a>,
that's what her x-ray vision
is seeking out in founders. Earnestness!
Who'd have guessed? Reporters literally can't believe it when
founders making piles of money say that they started their companies
to make the world better. The situation seems made for mockery.
How can these founders be so naive as not to realize how implausible
they sound?<br><br>Though those asking this question don't realize it, that's not a
rhetorical question.<br><br>A lot of founders are faking it, of course, particularly the smaller
fry, and the soon to be smaller fry. But not all of them. There are
a significant number of founders who really are interested in the
problem they're solving mainly for its own sake.<br><br>Why shouldn't there be? We have no difficulty believing that people
would be interested in history or math or even old bus tickets for
their own sake. Why can't there be people interested in self-driving
cars or social networks for their own sake? When you look at the
question from this side, it seems obvious there would be. And isn't
it likely that having a deep interest in something would be a source
of great energy and resilience? It is in every other field.<br><br>The question really is why we have a blind spot about business.
And the answer to that is obvious if you know enough history. For
most of history, making large amounts of money has not been very
intellectually interesting. In preindustrial times it was never far
from robbery, and some areas of business still retain that character,
except using lawyers instead of soldiers.<br><br>But there are other areas of business where the work is genuinely
interesting. Henry Ford got to spend much of his time working on
interesting technical problems, and for the last several decades
the trend in that direction has been accelerating. It's much easier
now to make a lot of money by working on something you're interested
in than it was <a href="re.html"><u>50 years ago</u></a>. 
And that, rather than how fast they
grow, may be the most important change that startups represent.
Though indeed, the fact that the work is genuinely interesting is
a big part of why it gets done so fast.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#dddddd">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Can you imagine a more important change than one in the relationship
between intellectual curiosity and money? These are two of the most
powerful forces in the world, and in my lifetime they've become
significantly more aligned. How could you not be fascinated to watch
something like this happening in real time?<br><br>I meant this essay to be about earnestness generally, and now I've
gone and talked about startups again. But I suppose at least it
serves as an example of an x nerd in the wild.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
It's interesting how many different ways there are <i>not</i> to
be earnest: to be cleverly cynical, to be superficially brilliant,
to be conspicuously virtuous, to be cool, to be sophisticated, to
be orthodox, to be a snob, to bully, to pander, to be on the make.
This pattern suggests that earnestness is not one end of a continuum,
but a target one can fall short of in multiple dimensions.<br><br>Another thing I notice about this list is that it sounds like a
list of the ways people behave on Twitter. Whatever else social
media is, it's a vivid catalogue of ways not to be earnest.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
People's motives are as mixed in Silicon Valley as anywhere
else. Even the founders motivated mostly by money tend to be at
least somewhat interested in the problem they're solving, and even
the founders most interested in the problem they're solving also
like the idea of getting rich. But there's great variation in the
relative proportions of different founders' motivations.<br><br>And when I talk about "wrong" motives, I don't mean morally wrong.
There's nothing morally wrong with starting a startup to make money.
I just mean that those startups don't do as well.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The most powerful motivator for most people is probably family.
But there are some for whom intellectual curiosity comes first. In
his (wonderful) autobiography, Paul Halmos says explicitly that for
a mathematician, math must come before anything else, including
family. Which at least implies that it did for him.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Interestingly, just as the word "nerd" implies earnestness even
when used as a metaphor, the word "politics" implies the opposite.
It's not only in actual politics that earnestness seems to be a
handicap, but also in office politics and academic politics.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
It's a bigger social error to seem naive in most European
countries than it is in America, and this may be one of subtler
reasons startups are less common there. Founder culture is completely
at odds with sophisticated cynicism.<br><br>The most earnest part of Europe is Scandinavia, and not surprisingly
this is also the region with the highest number of successful
startups per capita.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Much of business is schleps, and probably always will be. But
even being a professor is largely schleps. It would be interesting
to collect statistics about the schlep ratios of different jobs,
but I suspect they'd rarely be less than 30%.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Suhail Doshi, Jessica

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><div><div><div></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></div><div><br><br><div><h1 id="worked">What I Worked On</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">February 2021<br><br>Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,
were writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what
beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still
are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,
just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them
deep.<br><br>The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our
school district used for what was then called "data processing."
This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's
1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and
my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like
a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking
machines � CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader � sitting up
on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.<br><br>The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to
type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader
and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The
result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly
loud printer.<br><br>I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with
it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.
The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,
and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other
option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate
approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything
interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any
programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest
memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not
to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without
time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as
the data center manager's expression made clear.<br><br>With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a
computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond
to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through
a stack of punch cards and then stopping. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.
It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed
and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing
programs right into the computer.<br><br>Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of
nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about
1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was
good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote
simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would
fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one
book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so
he'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a
lot better than a typewriter.<br><br>Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.
In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more
powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study
of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in
other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when
I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the
space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed
ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases
that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.<br><br>I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at
the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept
being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.<br><br>AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things
especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein
called <i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i>, which featured an intelligent
computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry
Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading <i>The Moon is a Harsh
Mistress</i>, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it
I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of
time before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,
it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had
to do was teach SHRDLU more words.<br><br>There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate
classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning
Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.
The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,
and programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at
Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation
was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program
so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where
the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had
expected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was
supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a
roll. I knew what I was going to do.<br><br>For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God
did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,
but what made it even more exciting was my belief � hard to imagine
now, but not unique in 1985 � that it was already climbing the
lower slopes of intelligence.<br><br>I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose
a major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose
whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose "Artificial
Intelligence." When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed
to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as
scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly
accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.<br><br>I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for
AI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves
went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the
type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,
so that was where I went.<br><br>I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a
specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized
that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the
sort of AI in which a program that's told "the dog is sitting on
the chair" translates this into some formal representation and adds
it to the list of things it knows.<br><br>What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of
natural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.
It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they
could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,
in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole
way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,
was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,
generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various
band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to
get us Mike.<br><br>So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage
of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp
was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association
with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about
it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided
to write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little
I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But
there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you
learn it. The book, <i>On Lisp</i>, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote
much of it in grad school.<br><br>Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory
and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people
build things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for
theory � indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable
of the two halves � but building things seemed so much more exciting.<br><br>The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.
Any program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete
in a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in
footnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would
seem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of
the field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.<br><br>There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer
lab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could
have one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present
standards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so
off they went. That was what happened to systems work.<br><br>I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would
last.<br><br>In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at
CMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the
Carnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While
looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem
obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,
was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't
become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.<br><br>And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not
as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought
if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to
be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could
be truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get
research funding.<br><br>I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had
no idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually
that people made art � that it didn't just appear spontaneously
� but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.
They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange
things in profiles in <i>Life</i> magazine. The idea of actually being
able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost
miraculous.<br><br>That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students
could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,
was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I
was taking, he never said anything.<br><br>So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to
be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and
working away at <i>On Lisp</i>. In other words, like many a grad student,
I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my
thesis.<br><br>I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out
of grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember
when my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing
the internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a
spectacular way to get out of grad school.<br><br>Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into
professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate
that June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in
what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I
decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that
remained before the deadline, reusing parts of <i>On Lisp</i> where I
could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay "Yes,
I think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days."<br><br>I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect
I should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's
a whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted
was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation
sufficed, just barely.<br><br>Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in
the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because
it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted
me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence
I went.<br><br>I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that
I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,
because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different
ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do
the foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that
everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,
and design.<br><br>Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from
the Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to
Cambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me
to take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only
weeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I
had some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;
there was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now
all I had to do was learn Italian.<br><br>Only <i>stranieri</i> (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In
retrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because
there were so many <i>stranieri</i> attracted by the idea of studying
art in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been
outnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the
RISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed
to pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay
question by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the
intellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited
vocabulary. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.
Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in
the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again
about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting
department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,
but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the
students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in
return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.
And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the
conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those
little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century
studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible
without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides
me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally
trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.<br><br>Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made
a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a
local antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a
book, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look
old. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still
lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because
the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of
canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still
lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as
its name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about
15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.
So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint
a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person
you're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy
pixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop
there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what
makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.
You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,
that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is
that it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things
you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not
just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic
sense. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was
seeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're
seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes
that merely tell your brain "that's a water droplet" without telling
you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or
"that's a bush" without telling you the shape and position of every
leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it
would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when
you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and
when you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new
things after days of trying to paint something people usually take
for granted, just as you can <!-- still be noticing new things --> after
days of trying to write an essay about something people usually
take for granted.<br><br>This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a
good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth
trying.<br><br>Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked
hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of
passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me
anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the
end of the first year I went back to the US.<br><br>I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very
expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to
RISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which
made software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?
Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat
high end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#dddddd">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd
added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a
dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in
it. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I
hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad
employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and
since I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood
most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was
back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain
working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the
rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at
the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I
spent much of my time surreptitiously working on <i>On Lisp</i>, which I
had by this time gotten a contract to publish.<br><br>The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially
by art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the
rent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was
getting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was
just sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to
save enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.<br><br>I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly
about what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology
companies to be run by product people than sales people (though
sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good
at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,
that cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that
planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,
bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that
there's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the
optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal
place for it.<br><br>But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both
Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:
that it's good to be the "entry level" option, even though that
will be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will
be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means
that prestige is a danger sign.<br><br>When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do
freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and
this was how I survived for the next several years. When I came
back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new
thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of
SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at
Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big
part of my life.<br><br>In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.
The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had
been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art
school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.
Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was
now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship
to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the
painting department. The textile department, which my next door
neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt
illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.
Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the
more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive
signature style.<br><br>A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business
is known as a "schtick": something that immediately identifies the
work as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting
that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy
Lichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in
the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions
of dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature
style, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#dddddd">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who "could draw"
in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the
best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They
tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,
but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not
one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was
definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style
seekers.<br><br>I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I
was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for
free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,
and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A
rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New
York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than
my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists
were. So yes, I wanted it!
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#dddddd">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul
that turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do
something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the
Upper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least
wasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.
Now I was a New York artist � in the strictly technical sense of
making paintings and living in New York.<br><br>I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was
on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I
didn't want to have to program in another language, which in those
days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose
for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.
This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used
as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties
and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of
this book, <i>ANSI Common Lisp</i>, is one that I painted around this
time.)<br><br>The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and
Julian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early
photorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've
never known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers
of former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I
moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.<br><br>She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.
One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there
was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't
that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly
occurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work
on whatever I want.<br><br>Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called
the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited
him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It
seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical
user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It
seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.<br><br>If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.
I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided
we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't
honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that
this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art
galleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy
ones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate
web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and
set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up
galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.
It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites
for them for free, but none paid us.<br><br>Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that
except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd
been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called
an "internet storefront" was something we already knew how to build.<br><br>So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy
of <i>ANSI Common Lisp</i> to the publishers, we started trying to write
software to build online stores. At first this was going to be
normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.
That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to
write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix
world. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store
builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new
site generator for stores � in Lisp, of course.<br><br>We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate
was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his
room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a
mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress
I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran
the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking
on links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'
computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve
them from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.<br><br>This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at
the time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,
we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you
could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August
12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you
could build a whole store through the browser, without any client
software or typing anything into the command line on the server.<br><br>Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a
whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't
need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there
had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to
be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.
Now you could just update the software right on the server.<br><br>We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our
software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding
from Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the
initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%
of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y
Combinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because
we'd needed it ourselves.<br><br>At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand
dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by
what I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside
the proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?
No, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,
I needed that seed funding to live on.<br><br>We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious
about the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to
build a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating
pages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be
generated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,
the links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the
server.<br><br>It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online
store builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking
legit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts
and colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his
bedroom look more legit than a big company.<br><br>(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because
it's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but
in 1996 it was the last word in slick.)<br><br>In September, Robert rebelled. "We've been working on this for a
month," he said, "and it's still not done." This is funny in
retrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years
later. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,
and I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.
He recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because
at that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything
in his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with
him. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a
frighteningly effective hacker.<br><br>It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two
most <a href="think.html"><u>independent-minded</u></a> people 
I know, and in completely different
ways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a
colonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's
it would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.<br><br>We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just
as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were
late, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of
talk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually
wanted online stores.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#dddddd">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which
people used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,
which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and
statistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one
of the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight
and didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's
and Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do
was work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the
easiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of
it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were
instead the most stressful.<br><br>There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second
half of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not
the Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It
was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make
Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a
month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low
price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of
competitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we
set the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.
$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.<br><br>We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,
we did what's now called "doing things that 
<a href="ds.html"><u>don't scale</u></a>," although
at the time we would have described it as "being so lame that we're
driven to the most desperate measures to get users." The most common
of which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly
humiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that
people could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get
users.<br><br>We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For
example, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt
(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better
to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.
The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to
rescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were
so beautiful too.<br><br>Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.
Building stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it
felt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled
by "business" and thought we needed a "business person" to be in
charge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,
in much the same way I was converted to 
<a href="kids.html"><u>fatherhood</u></a> once I had kids.
Whatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have
so many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in
the meantime there was nothing more important to do.<br><br>Another thing I didn't get at the time is that 
<a href="growth.html"><u>growth rate</u></a> is the
ultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about
70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I
mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number
of users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that
that's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,
you might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate
takes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was
advising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed
out, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't
hire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then
you'll control your own destiny.<br><br>Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted
me to, and partly because that's what startups did during the
Internet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would
have seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about
when Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we
were at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.
And since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the
result was a mess even by startup standards.<br><br>It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb
stock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable
and growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had
no idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of
the near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor
had I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we
started. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to
riches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow
1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were
by far the most luxurious thing I owned.<br><br>The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must
have been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at
the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running
Viaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue
my usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue
combined with Yahoo's prematurely aged
<a href="yahoo.html"><u>culture</u></a> and grim cube farm
in Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it
felt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.<br><br>Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the
time I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth
anything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next
year. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the
summer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything
that I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been
entirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had
done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now
I was rich, so I should go paint.<br><br>When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation
with me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures
I wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an
interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.
My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I
was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to
go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people
with me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was
ground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving
then to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,
and yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.<br><br>But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.
There was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.
Now when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their
companies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's
what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing
for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.<br><br>So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or
ambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people
in California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in
the Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from
anywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation
I went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent
control you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed
up like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and
there were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't
know any of them.<br><br>When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was
rich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,
except now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was
tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless
it was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked
past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It
was exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented
with a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the
old way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and
then use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted
from the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).<br><br>Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually
choose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and
various real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by
occasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there
wasn't one. Huh.<br><br>Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear
from our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why
not build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit
code on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting
applications for them?
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#dddddd">9</font></a>]</font>
You could run all sorts of services
on the servers that these applications could use just by making an
API call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,
taking credit card payments, etc.<br><br>I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything
else. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly
want to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would
have to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and
start it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but
there I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and
though he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into
working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.
So while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly
refused to work on it.<br><br>Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had
worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and
we got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty
companies and several open source projects worth of software. The
language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of
Lisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt
Lisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan
did.<br><br>By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an
"application service provider," or ASP. This name didn't last long
before it was replaced by "software as a service," but it was current
for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going
to be called Aspra.<br><br>I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network
infrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two
services (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the
summer I realized I really didn't want to run a company � especially
not a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd
only started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't
need money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be
realized as a company, then screw the vision. I'd build a subset
that could be done as an open source project.<br><br>Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not
wasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often
encounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and
it was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and
even trying to write some of it.<br><br>The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,
whose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp
hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the
distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and
partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of
Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So
at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new
dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.<br><br>The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a
talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp
at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,
on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but
had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.
What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone
had posted it on Slashdot.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#dddddd">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put
it on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but
it was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel
to readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only
way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published
as a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish
anything.<br><br>This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people
had realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building
the infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer
as well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it
took me several years to understand the implications. It meant there
would be a whole new generation of 
<a href="essay.html"><u>essays</u></a>.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#dddddd">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been
vanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers
who went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed
to publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.
There were so many essays that had never been written, because there
had been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going
to write them.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#dddddd">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there
was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was
when I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that
whatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.<br><br>I knew that online essays would be a 
<a href="marginal.html"><u>marginal</u></a> medium at first.
Socially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their
GeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions
published in <i>The New Yorker</i>. But by this point I knew enough to
find that encouraging instead of discouraging.<br><br>One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how
well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't
prestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form
of painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started
them. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what
I'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish
on my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in
something like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.<br><br>It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when
you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current
lack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to
be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.
Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is
going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.
So while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee
you're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the
most common type of wrong one.<br><br>Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds
of different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a
book, called <i>Hackers &amp; Painters</i> after one of the essays in it. I
also worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to
have dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which
taught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in
Cambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn
studio), to use as an office.<br><br>One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was
a clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday
diners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one
party. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be
people they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests
was someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman
called Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.<br><br>Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.
This bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,
as she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised
how different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So
she decided to compile a book of 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Early/dp/1430210788"><u>interviews</u></a> with startup founders.<br><br>When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her
staff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed
for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make
up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about
all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They
should make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a
handful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical
founders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as
CEO, and so on.<br><br>One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.
The prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people
and tell them something that won't waste their time is a great
spur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the
undergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would
tell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the
worst of the mistakes we'd made.<br><br>So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the
best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,
because then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed
they were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect
of having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known),
I blurted out "But not me!" and went on with the talk. But afterward
it occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about
angel investing. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now
it was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.<br><br>Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects
we could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed
like there had to be something we could collaborate on.<br><br>As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the
corner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged.
Screw the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd
start our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd
been talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and
work for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#dddddd">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to
be angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways
to learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices,
and some of the things we did turned out to be novel.<br><br>There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure
them all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.
In those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC
firms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was
to make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments.
And there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were
individuals who were usually focused on other things and made
investments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough
in the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects,
because we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing
Julian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us
set up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software,
but actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all
that stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to
make seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had
done for us.<br><br>YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we
funded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers,
but professional investors are thinking "Wow, that means they got
all the returns." But once again, this was not due to any particular
insight on our part. We didn't know how VC firms were organized.
It never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we
wouldn't have known where to start.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#dddddd">14</font></a>]</font><br><br>The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a
bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three
months focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we
discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due
to our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as
investors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch
of startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech
companies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where
they'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being
in a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense
be fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out
of it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and
they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer
than they would working at Microsoft.<br><br>We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.
We'd all have dinner there once a week � on tuesdays, since I was
already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays � and after
dinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.<br><br>We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a
matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders
Program, and I posted an 
<a href="summerfounder.html"><u>announcement</u></a> 
on my site, inviting undergrads
to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way
to get "deal flow," as investors call it, but it turned out to be
the perfect source.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#dddddd">15</font></a>]</font>
We got 225 applications for the Summer
Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them
were from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that
spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious
than we'd intended.<br><br>We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and
from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That
first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went
on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the
RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access,
and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.
I don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.
You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the
Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place
like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.<br><br>The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did
with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students
got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the
typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to
be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had
taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought
the founders free air conditioners.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#dddddd">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale
startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient
for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups
at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too.
It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the
isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who
understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they
were solving them.<br><br>As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The
alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another,
and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being
in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's
customers. We used to refer jokingly to the "YC GDP," but as YC
grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups
get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their
batchmates.<br><br>I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going
to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew,
and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more
than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was
still able to work on other things.<br><br>In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version
of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into
Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was
originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and
was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of
reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders
we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed
the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's
intellectual curiosity.<br><br>HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest
source of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help
founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN
was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work
should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas
I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not
from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an
ill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during
YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40%
chance it had do with everything else combined.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f17n"><font color="#dddddd">17</font></a>]</font><br><br>As well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. But
while I continued to work a good deal <i>in</i> Arc, I gradually stopped
working <i>on</i> Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly
because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language
now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my
three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on
YC.<br><br>YC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of
deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every
6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems,
whatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work,
because their problems were quite varied, and the good founders
were very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could
about startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have
picked a better way to do it.<br><br>There were parts of the job I didn't like. Disputes between cofounders,
figuring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who
maltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the
parts I didn't like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once
said about companies: "No one works harder than the boss." He meant
it both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second
part that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked
set the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better
work very hard.<br><br>One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews,
Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited
advice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at
Viaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested
that it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital.
That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I
remember his exact words very clearly. "You know," he said, "you
should make sure Y Combinator isn't the last cool thing you do."<br><br>At the time I didn't understand what he meant, but gradually it
dawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange
advice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer
than Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me
thinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be
the last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my
attention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of
eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave
eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.<br><br>In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned
out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed
her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really
wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I
were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to
visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those
flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to
someone else.<br><br>I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so
we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and
Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard.
Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we
four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to
do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said
yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and
Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.<br><br>When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he
said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors.
But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided
he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest
of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could
learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose
cancer had returned.<br><br>She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was
still hard when it did.<br><br>I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups
through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still
talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested
in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)<br><br>What should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about
that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided
I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused
on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting.
I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was
at least completely engaging.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f18n"><font color="#dddddd">18</font></a>]</font><br><br>I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to
work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had
been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the
middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd
always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would
turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So
I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted
since. So far anyway.<br><br>I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum
game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project
that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's
getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was
some opportunity cost to screwing around.<br><br>I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over
the next few months. I even wrote a couple that 
<a href="know.html"><u>weren't</u></a> about
startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.<br><br>The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language
defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally
intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was
meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the
Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language
in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need?
The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered,
is an answer to that question.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f19n"><font color="#dddddd">19</font></a>]</font><br><br>McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program
computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell
translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language,
and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language
in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation
gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.
It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand
why at the time.<br><br>McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions.
It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language.
So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined
using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have
been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by
hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting
close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way � indeed,
there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more
complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers
then weren't powerful enough.<br><br>Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's
axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language.
And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a
discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle,
end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to
do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle,
why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years,
from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I
had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep
at it for so long.<br><br>I wrote this new Lisp, called <a href="bel.html"><u>Bel</u></a>, 
in itself in Arc. That may sound
like a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery
I had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious
collection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an
interpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast,
but fast enough to test.<br><br>I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time,
or I'd never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing
essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely
understand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as
because the problem is so convoluted. When you're working on an
interpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's
happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted
by the time you get them.<br><br>So I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people
about Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have
seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder
than I'd ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for
hours with some gruesome bug I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone
asking "Does Paul Graham still code?"<br><br>Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively
that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head
and could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the
coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some
problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the
tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that
because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news
is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.<br><br>In the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to
see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a
British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only
meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still
live there. So most of Bel was written in England.<br><br>In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's
original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although
like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.<br><br>Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics
I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also
started to think about other things I could work on. How should I
choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the
past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I
was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If
this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would
be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with
similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others
to read, and this is the last sentence of it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers:

Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be
predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps
like <i>polluzione</i>). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you
string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs,
you can make a little Italian go a long way.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia
went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across
the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery,
and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at
street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter
evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with
tourists.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
You can of course paint people like still lives if you want
to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex

Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and

Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when
the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the
stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully
obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch
privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and
making sure they had decent-looking stores.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
We'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their
own page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp
expressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the
code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers
visited them.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience,
and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found
they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was
better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?
People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me
how sorry they feel for me, but I'm not exaggerating when I reply
that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It
comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they
<a href="useful.html"><u>don't already know</u></a>, and some 
people dislike being told such things.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of
course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing
it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as

There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y
Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long
after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary
VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays,
been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more
expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap
and common, but the VCs' customs still reflected the old world,
just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints
of the print era.<br><br>Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e.
less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected
by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).<br><br>Here's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which
fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and
venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay
writing would be?<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were
called Cambridge Seed. But we didn't want a regional name, in case
someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after
one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.<br><br>I picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and
partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors
like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying
to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside
joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made
the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.<br><br>[<a name="f14n"><font color="#000000">14</font></a>]
YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009,
because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it
personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go
back to being self-funded.<br><br>[<a name="f15n"><font color="#000000">15</font></a>]
I've never liked the term "deal flow," because it implies
that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This
is not only false, but it's the purpose of YC to falsify it, by
causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.<br><br>[<a name="f16n"><font color="#000000">16</font></a>]

Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs
when you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum,
you're assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every
conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post
highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually
these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination
is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations,
because the assumption that you're present in the conversation means
that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation
reads as a tacit admission that it's correct. But that in turn
encourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses
that now is their chance.<br><br>[<a name="f18n"><font color="#000000">18</font></a>]
The worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica
anymore. We'd been working on YC almost the whole time we'd known
each other, and we'd neither tried nor wanted to separate it from
our personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted
tree.<br><br>[<a name="f19n"><font color="#000000">19</font></a>]
One way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs
discovered is to talk about space aliens. Any sufficiently advanced
alien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean
theorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that
they would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper.<br><br>But if so there's no reason to suppose that this is the limit of
the language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need
numbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at
least one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness
is preserved.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel

If you haven't been involved with nonprofits, you may never have
heard this phrase before. But if you have been, it probably made
you wince.<br><br>Restricted donations mean donations where the donor limits what can
be done with the money. This is common with big donations, perhaps
the default. And yet it's usually a bad idea. Usually the way the
donor wants the money spent is not the way the nonprofit would have
chosen. Otherwise there would have been no need to restrict the
donation. But who has a better understanding of where money needs
to be spent, the nonprofit or the donor?<br><br>If a nonprofit doesn't understand better than its donors where money
needs to be spent, then it's incompetent and you shouldn't be
donating to it at all.<br><br>Which means a restricted donation is inherently suboptimal. It's
either a donation to a bad nonprofit, or a donation for the wrong
things.<br><br>There are a couple exceptions to this principle. One is when the
nonprofit is an umbrella organization. It's reasonable to make a
restricted donation to a university, for example, because a university
is only nominally a single nonprofit. Another exception is when the
donor actually does know as much as the nonprofit about where money
needs to be spent. The Gates Foundation, for example, has specific
goals and often makes restricted donations to individual nonprofits
to accomplish them. But unless you're a domain expert yourself or
donating to an umbrella organization, your donation would do more
good if it were unrestricted.<br><br>If restricted donations do less good than unrestricted ones, why
do donors so often make them? Partly because doing good isn't donors'
only motive. They often have other motives as well — to make a mark,
or to generate good publicity
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font>,
or to comply with regulations
or corporate policies. Many donors may simply never have considered
the distinction between restricted and unrestricted donations. They
may believe that donating money for some specific purpose is just
how donation works. And to be fair, nonprofits don't try very hard
to discourage such illusions. They can't afford to. People running
nonprofits are almost always anxious about money. They can't afford
to talk back to big donors.<br><br>You can't expect candor in a relationship so asymmetric. So I'll
tell you what nonprofits wish they could tell you. If you want to
donate to a nonprofit, donate unrestricted. If you trust them to
spend your money, trust them to decide how.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Note</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Unfortunately restricted donations tend to generate more
publicity than unrestricted ones. "X donates money to build a school
in Africa" is not only more interesting than "X donates money to Y
nonprofit to spend as Y chooses," but also focuses more attention
on X.<br><br>

is to read, the more deeply readers will engage with it. The less
energy they expend on your prose, the more they'll have left for
your ideas.<br><br>And the further they'll read. Most readers' energy tends to flag
part way through an article or essay. If the friction of reading
is low enough, more keep going till the end.<br><br>There's an Italian dish called <i>saltimbocca</i>, which means "leap
into the mouth." My goal when writing might be called <i>saltintesta</i>:
the ideas leap into your head and you barely notice the words that
got them there.<br><br>It's too much to hope that writing could ever be pure ideas. You
might not even want it to be. But for most writers, most of the
time, that's the goal to aim for. The gap between most writing and
pure ideas is not filled with poetry.<br><br>Plus it's more considerate to write simply. When you write in a
fancy way to impress people, you're making them do extra work just
so you can seem cool. It's like trailing a long train behind you
that readers have to carry.<br><br>And remember, if you're writing in English, that a lot of your
readers won't be native English speakers. Their understanding of
ideas may be way ahead of their understanding of English. So you
can't assume that writing about a difficult topic means you can
use difficult words.<br><br>Of course, fancy writing doesn't just conceal ideas. It can also
conceal the lack of them. That's why some people write that way,
to conceal the fact that they have 
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=hermeneutic+dialectics+hegemonic+modalities"><u></u></a> nothing to say. Whereas writing
simply keeps you honest. If you say nothing simply, it will be
obvious to everyone, including you.<br><br>Simple writing also lasts better. People reading your stuff in the
future will be in much the same position as people from other
countries reading it today. The culture and the language will have
changed. It's not vain to care about that, any more than it's vain
for a woodworker to build a chair to last.<br><br>Indeed, lasting is not merely an accidental quality of chairs, or
writing. It's a sign you did a good job.<br><br>But although these are all real advantages of writing simply, none
of them are why I do it. The main reason I write simply is that it
offends me not to. When I write a sentence that seems too complicated,
or that uses unnecessarily intellectual words, it doesn't seem fancy
to me. It seems clumsy.<br><br>There are of course times when you want to use a complicated sentence
or fancy word for effect. But you should never do it by accident.<br><br>The other reason my writing ends up being simple is the way I do
it. I write the first draft fast, then spend days editing it, trying
to get everything just right. Much of this editing is cutting, and
that makes simple writing even simpler.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><div><div><div></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></div><div><br><br><div><h1 id="richnow">How People Get Rich Now</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">April 2021<br><br>Every year since 1982, <i>Forbes</i> magazine has published a list of the
richest Americans. If we compare the 100 richest people in 1982 to
the 100 richest in 2020, we notice some big differences.<br><br>In 1982 the most common source of wealth was inheritance. Of the
100 richest people, 60 inherited from an ancestor. There were 10
du Pont heirs alone. By 2020 the number of heirs had been cut in
half, accounting for only 27 of the biggest 100 fortunes.<br><br>Why would the percentage of heirs decrease? Not because inheritance
taxes increased. In fact, they decreased significantly during this
period. The reason the percentage of heirs has decreased is not
that fewer people are inheriting great fortunes, but that more
people are making them.<br><br>How are people making these new fortunes? Roughly 3/4 by starting
companies and 1/4 by investing. Of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 56
derive from founders' or early employees' equity (52 founders, 2
early employees, and 2 wives of founders), and 17 from managing
investment funds.<br><br>There were no fund managers among the 100 richest Americans in 1982.
Hedge funds and private equity firms existed in 1982, but none of
their founders were rich enough yet to make it into the top 100.
Two things changed: fund managers discovered new ways to generate
high returns, and more investors were willing to trust them with
their money.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>But the main source of new fortunes now is starting companies, and
when you look at the data, you see big changes there too. People
get richer from starting companies now than they did in 1982, because
the companies do different things.<br><br>In 1982, there were two dominant sources of new wealth: oil and
real estate. Of the 40 new fortunes in 1982, at least 24 were due
primarily to oil or real estate. Now only a small number are: of
the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 4 were due to real estate and only 2
to oil.<br><br>By 2020 the biggest source of new wealth was what are sometimes
called "tech" companies. Of the 73 new fortunes, about 30 derive
from such companies. These are particularly common among the richest
of the rich: 8 of the top 10 fortunes in 2020 were new fortunes of
this type.<br><br>Arguably it's slightly misleading to treat tech as a category.
Isn't Amazon really a retailer, and Tesla a car maker? Yes and no.
Maybe in 50 years, when what we call tech is taken for granted, it
won't seem right to put these two businesses in the same category.
But at the moment at least, there is definitely something they share
in common that distinguishes them. What retailer starts AWS? What
car maker is run by someone who also has a rocket company?<br><br>The tech companies behind the top 100 fortunes also form a
well-differentiated group in the sense that they're all companies
that venture capitalists would readily invest in, and the others
mostly not. And there's a reason why: these are mostly companies
that win by having better technology, rather than just a CEO who's
really driven and good at making deals.<br><br>To that extent, the rise of the tech companies represents a qualitative
change. The oil and real estate magnates of the 1982 Forbes 400
didn't win by making better technology. They won by being really
driven and good at making deals. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font>
And indeed, that way of
getting rich is so old that it predates the Industrial Revolution.
The courtiers who got rich in the (nominal) service of European
royal houses in the 16th and 17th centuries were also, as a rule,
really driven and good at making deals.<br><br>People who don't look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look
back on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those who
got rich then didn't get as rich. But if you dig into <i>how</i> they
got rich, the old days don't look so good. In 1982, 84% of the
richest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural
resources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than
a world in which the richest people get rich by starting tech
companies?<br><br>Why are people starting so many more new companies than they used
to, and why are they getting so rich from it? The answer to the
first question, curiously enough, is that it's misphrased. We
shouldn't be asking why people are starting companies, but why
they're starting companies <i>again</i>.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>In 1892, the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i> compiled a list of all the
millionaires in America. They found 4047 of them. How many had
inherited their wealth then? Only about 20%, which is less than the
proportion of heirs today. And when you investigate the sources of
the new fortunes, 1892 looks even more like today. Hugh Rockoff
found that "many of the richest ... gained their initial edge from
the new technology of mass production."
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>So it's not 2020 that's the anomaly here, but 1982. The real question
is why so few people had gotten rich from starting companies in
1982. And the answer is that even as the <i>Herald Tribune</i>'s list was
being compiled, a wave of <a href="re.html"><u>consolidation</u></a> 
was sweeping through the
American economy. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
financiers like J. P. Morgan combined thousands of smaller companies
into a few hundred giant ones with commanding economies of scale.
By the end of World War II, as Michael Lind writes, "the major
sectors of the economy were either organized as government-backed
cartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic corporations."
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#dddddd">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>In 1960, most of the people who start startups today would have
gone to work for one of them. You could get rich from starting your
own company in 1890 and in 2020, but in 1960 it was not really a
viable option. You couldn't break through the oligopolies to get
at the markets. So the prestigious route in 1960 was not to start
your own company, but to work your way up the corporate ladder at
an existing one.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#dddddd">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Making everyone a corporate employee decreased economic inequality
(and every other kind of variation), but if your model of normal
is the mid 20th century, you have a very misleading model in that
respect. J. P. Morgan's economy turned out to be just a phase, and
starting in the 1970s, it began to break up.<br><br>Why did it break up? Partly senescence. The big companies that
seemed models of scale and efficiency in 1930 had by 1970 become
slack and bloated. By 1970 the rigid structure of the economy was
full of cosy nests that various groups had built to insulate
themselves from market forces. During the Carter administration the
federal government realized something was amiss and began, in a
process they called "deregulation," to roll back the policies that
propped up the oligopolies.<br><br>But it wasn't just decay from within that broke up J. P. Morgan's
economy. There was also pressure from without, in the form of new
technology, and particularly microelectronics. The best way to
envision what happened is to imagine a pond with a crust of ice on
top. Initially the only way from the bottom to the surface is around
the edges. But as the ice crust weakens, you start to be able to
punch right through the middle.<br><br>The edges of the pond were pure tech: companies that actually
described themselves as being in the electronics or software business.
When you used the word "startup" in 1990, that was what you meant.
But now startups are punching right through the middle of the ice
crust and displacing incumbents like retailers and TV networks and
car companies.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#dddddd">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>But though the breakup of J. P. Morgan's economy created a new world
in the technological sense, it was a reversion to the norm in the
social sense. If you only look back as far as the mid 20th century,
it seems like people getting rich by starting their own companies
is a recent phenomenon. But if you look back further, you realize
it's actually the default. So what we should expect in the future
is more of the same. Indeed, we should expect both the number and
wealth of founders to grow, because every decade it gets easier to
start a startup.<br><br>Part of the reason it's getting easier to start a startup is social.
Society is (re)assimilating the concept. If you start one now, your
parents won't freak out the way they would have a generation ago,
and knowledge about how to do it is much more widespread. But the
main reason it's easier to start a startup now is that it's cheaper.
Technology has driven down the cost of both building products and
acquiring customers.<br><br>The decreasing cost of starting a startup has in turn changed the
balance of power between founders and investors. Back when starting
a startup meant building a factory, you needed investors' permission
to do it at all. But now investors need founders more than founders
need investors, and that, combined with the increasing amount of
venture capital available, has driven up valuations.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#dddddd">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>So the decreasing cost of starting a startup increases the number
of rich people in two ways: it means that more people start them,
and that those who do can raise money on better terms.<br><br>But there's also a third factor at work: the companies themselves
are more valuable, because newly founded companies grow faster than
they used to. Technology hasn't just made it cheaper to build and
distribute things, but faster too.<br><br>This trend has been running for a long time. IBM, founded in 1896,
took 45 years to reach a billion 2020 dollars in revenue.
Hewlett-Packard, founded in 1939, took 25 years. Microsoft, founded
in 1975, took 13 years. Now the norm for fast-growing companies is
7 or 8 years.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#dddddd">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>Fast growth has a double effect on the value of founders' stock.
The value of a company is a function of its revenue and its growth
rate. So if a company grows faster, you not only get to a billion
dollars in revenue sooner, but the company is more valuable when
it reaches that point than it would be if it were growing slower.<br><br>That's why founders sometimes get so rich so young now. The low
initial cost of starting a startup means founders can start young,
and the fast growth of companies today means that if they succeed
they could be surprisingly rich just a few years later.<br><br>It's easier now to start and grow a company than it has ever been.
That means more people start them, that those who do get better
terms from investors, and that the resulting companies become more
valuable. Once you understand how these mechanisms work, and that
startups were suppressed for most of the 20th century, you don't
have to resort to some vague right turn the country took under
Reagan to explain why America's Gini coefficient is increasing. Of
course the Gini coefficient is increasing. With more people starting
more valuable companies, how could it not be?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Investment firms grew rapidly after a regulatory change by
the Labor Department in 1978 allowed pension funds to invest in
them, but the effects of this growth were not yet visible in the
top 100 fortunes in 1982.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
George Mitchell deserves mention as an exception. Though
really driven and good at making deals, he was also the first to
figure out how to use fracking to get natural gas out of shale.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
When I say people are starting more companies, I mean the
type of company meant to <a href="growth.html"><u>grow</u></a> 
very big. There has actually been a
decrease in the last couple decades in the overall number of new
companies. But the vast majority of companies are small retail and
service businesses. So what the statistics about the decreasing
number of new businesses mean is that people are starting fewer
shoe stores and barber shops.<br><br>People sometimes get <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201505/leigh-buchanan/the-vanishing-startups-in-decline.html"><u>confused</u></a> when they see a graph labelled
"startups" that's going down, because there are two senses of the
word "startup": (1) the founding of a company, and (2) a particular
type of company designed to grow big fast. The statistics mean
startup in sense (1), not sense (2).<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]

Lind, Michael. <i>Land of Promise.</i> HarperCollins, 2012.<br><br>It's also likely that the high tax rates in the mid 20th century
deterred people from starting their own companies. Starting one's
own company is risky, and when risk isn't rewarded, people opt for
<a href="inequality.html"><u>safety</u></a> instead.<br><br>But it wasn't simply cause and effect. The oligopolies and high tax
rates of the mid 20th century were all of a piece. Lower taxes are
not just a cause of entrepreneurship, but an effect as well: the
people getting rich in the mid 20th century from real estate and
oil exploration lobbied for and got huge tax loopholes that made
their effective tax rate much lower, and presumably if it had been
more common to grow big companies by building new technology, the
people doing that would have lobbied for their own loopholes as
well.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
That's why the people who did get rich in the mid 20th century
so often got rich from oil exploration or real estate. Those were
the two big areas of the economy that weren't susceptible to
consolidation.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
The pure tech companies used to be called "high technology" startups.
But now that startups can punch through the middle of the ice crust,
we don't need a separate name for the edges, and the term "high-tech"
has a decidedly <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=high+tech&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=en-2019&amp;smoothing=3"><u>retro</u></a> 
sound.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Higher valuations mean you either sell less stock to get a
given amount of money, or get more money for a given amount of
stock. The typical startup does some of each. Obviously you end up
richer if you keep more stock, but you should also end up richer
if you raise more money, because (a) it should make the company
more successful, and (b) you should be able to last longer before
the next round, or not even need one. Notice all those shoulds
though. In practice a lot of money slips through them.<br><br>It might seem that the huge rounds raised by startups nowadays
contradict the claim that it has become cheaper to start one. But
there's no contradiction here; the startups that raise the most are
the ones doing it by choice, in order to grow faster, not the ones
doing it because they need the money to survive. There's nothing
like not needing money to make people offer it to you.<br><br>You would think, after having been on the side of labor in its fight
with capital for almost two centuries, that the far left would be
happy that labor has finally prevailed. But none of them seem to
be. You can almost hear them saying "No, no, not <i>that</i> way."<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]

things like whether it's permissible for the state to take someone's
life, whether the death penalty acts as a deterrent, and whether
more death sentences are given to some groups than others. But in
practice the debate about the death penalty is not about whether
it's ok to kill murderers. It's about whether it's ok to kill
innocent people, because at least 4% of people on death row are
<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7230"><u>innocent</u></a>.<br><br>When I was a kid I imagined that it was unusual for people to be
convicted of crimes they hadn't committed, and that in murder cases
especially this must be very rare. Far from it. Now, thanks to
organizations like the
<a href="https://innocenceproject.org/all-cases"><u>Innocence Project</u></a>,
we see a constant stream
of stories about murder convictions being overturned after new
evidence emerges. Sometimes the police and prosecutors were just
very sloppy. Sometimes they were crooked, and knew full well they
were convicting an innocent person.<br><br>Kenneth Adams and three other men spent 18 years in prison on a
murder conviction. They were exonerated after DNA testing implicated
three different men, two of whom later confessed. The police had
been told about the other men early in the investigation, but never
followed up the lead.<br><br>Keith Harward spent 33 years in prison on a murder conviction. He
was convicted because "experts" said his teeth matched photos of
bite marks on one victim. He was exonerated after DNA testing showed
the murder had been committed by another man, Jerry Crotty.<br><br>Ricky Jackson and two other men spent 39 years in prison after being
convicted of murder on the testimony of a 12 year old boy, who later
recanted and said he'd been coerced by police. Multiple people have
confirmed the boy was elsewhere at the time. The three men were
exonerated after the county prosecutor dropped the charges, saying
"The state is conceding the obvious."<br><br>Alfred Brown spent 12 years in prison on a murder conviction,
including 10 years on death row. He was exonerated after it was
discovered that the assistant district attorney had concealed phone
records proving he could not have committed the crimes.<br><br>Glenn Ford spent 29 years on death row after having been convicted
of murder. He was exonerated after new evidence proved he was not
even at the scene when the murder occurred. The attorneys assigned
to represent him had never tried a jury case before.<br><br>Cameron Willingham was actually executed in 2004 by lethal injection.
The "expert" who testified that he deliberately set fire to his
house has since been discredited. A re-examination of the case
ordered by the state of Texas in 2009 concluded that "a finding of
arson could not be sustained."<br><br><a href="https://saverichardglossip.com/facts"><u>Rich Glossip</u></a> 
has spent 20 years on death row after being convicted
of murder on the testimony of the actual killer, who escaped with
a life sentence in return for implicating him. In 2015 he came
within minutes of execution before it emerged that Oklahoma had
been planning to kill him with an illegal combination of drugs.
They still plan to go ahead with the execution, perhaps as soon as
this summer, despite 
<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/oklahoma/articles/2020-10-14/attorney-for-oklahoma-death-row-inmate-claims-new-evidence"><u>new 
evidence</u></a> exonerating him.<br><br>I could go on. There are hundreds of similar cases. In Florida
alone, 29 death row prisoners have been exonerated so far.<br><br>Far from being rare, wrongful murder convictions are 
<a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/innocence/description-of-innocence-cases"><u>very common</u></a>.
Police are under pressure to solve a crime that has gotten a lot
of attention. When they find a suspect, they want to believe he's
guilty, and ignore or even destroy evidence suggesting otherwise.
District attorneys want to be seen as effective and tough on crime,
and in order to win convictions are willing to manipulate witnesses
and withhold evidence. Court-appointed defense attorneys are
overworked and often incompetent. There's a ready supply of criminals
willing to give false testimony in return for a lighter sentence,
suggestible witnesses who can be made to say whatever police want,
and bogus "experts" eager to claim that science proves the defendant
is guilty. And juries want to believe them, since otherwise some
terrible crime remains unsolved.<br><br>This circus of incompetence and dishonesty is the real issue with
the death penalty. We don't even reach the point where theoretical
questions about the moral justification or effectiveness of capital
punishment start to matter, because so many of the people sentenced
to death are actually innocent. Whatever it means in theory, in
practice capital punishment means killing innocent people.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

a new NFT. It has a dramatic name, <a href="http://bit.ly/NooraNFT"><u>Save Thousands of Lives</u></a>,
because that's what the proceeds will do.<br><br>Noora has been saving lives for 7 years. They run programs in
hospitals in South Asia to teach new mothers how to take care of
their babies once they get home. They're in 165 hospitals now. And
because they know the numbers before and after they start at a new
hospital, they can measure the impact they have. It is massive.
For every 1000 live births, they save 9 babies.<br><br>This number comes from a <a href="http://bit.ly/NFT-research"><u>study</u></a>
of 133,733 families at 28 different
hospitals that Noora conducted in collaboration with the Better
Birth team at Ariadne Labs, a joint center for health systems
innovation at Brigham and Women�s Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan
School of Public Health.<br><br>Noora is so effective that even if you measure their costs in the
most conservative way, by dividing their entire budget by the number
of lives saved, the cost of saving a life is the lowest I've seen.
$1,235.<br><br>For this NFT, they're going to issue a public report tracking how
this specific tranche of money is spent, and estimating the number
of lives saved as a result.<br><br>NFTs are a new territory, and this way of using them is especially
new, but I'm excited about its potential. And I'm excited to see
what happens with this particular auction, because unlike an NFT
representing something that has already happened,
this NFT gets better as the price gets higher.<br><br>The reserve price was about $2.5 million, because that's what it
takes for the name to be accurate: that's what it costs to save
2000 lives. But the higher the price of this NFT goes, the more
lives will be saved. What a sentence to be able to write.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

If someone I knew to be both a domain expert and a reasonable person
proposed an idea that sounded preposterous, I'd be very reluctant
to say "That will never work."<br><br>Anyone who has studied the history of ideas, and especially the
history of science, knows that's how big things start. Someone
proposes an idea that sounds crazy, most people dismiss it, then
it gradually takes over the world.<br><br>Most implausible-sounding ideas are in fact bad and could be safely
dismissed. But not when they're proposed by reasonable domain
experts. If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then they
know how implausible it sounds. And yet they're proposing it anyway.
That suggests they know something you don't. And if they have deep
domain expertise, that's probably the source of it.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Such ideas are not merely unsafe to dismiss, but disproportionately
likely to be interesting. When the average person proposes an
implausible-sounding idea, its implausibility is evidence of their
incompetence. But when a reasonable domain expert does it, the
situation is reversed. There's something like an efficient market
here: on average the ideas that seem craziest will, if correct,
have the biggest effect. So if you can eliminate the theory that
the person proposing an implausible-sounding idea is incompetent,
its implausibility switches from evidence that it's boring to
evidence that it's exciting.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Such ideas are not guaranteed to work. But they don't have to be.
They just have to be sufficiently good bets — to have sufficiently
high expected value. And I think on average they do. I think if you
bet on the entire set of implausible-sounding ideas proposed by
reasonable domain experts, you'd end up net ahead.<br><br>The reason is that everyone is too conservative. The word "paradigm"
is overused, but this is a case where it's warranted. Everyone is
too much in the grip of the current paradigm. Even the people who
have the new ideas undervalue them initially. Which means that
before they reach the stage of proposing them publicly, they've
already subjected them to an excessively strict filter.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The wise response to such an idea is not to make statements, but
to ask questions, because there's a real mystery here. Why has this
smart and reasonable person proposed an idea that seems so wrong?
Are they mistaken, or are you? One of you has to be. If you're the
one who's mistaken, that would be good to know, because it means
there's a hole in your model of the world. But even if they're
mistaken, it should be interesting to learn why. A trap that an
expert falls into is one you have to worry about too.<br><br>This all seems pretty obvious. And yet there are clearly a lot of
people who don't share my fear of dismissing new ideas. Why do they
do it? Why risk looking like a jerk now and a fool later, instead
of just reserving judgement?<br><br>One reason they do it is envy. If you propose a radical new idea
and it succeeds, your reputation (and perhaps also your wealth)
will increase proportionally. Some people would be envious if that
happened, and this potential envy propagates back into a conviction
that you must be wrong.<br><br>Another reason people dismiss new ideas is that it's an easy way
to seem sophisticated. When a new idea first emerges, it usually
seems pretty feeble. It's a mere hatchling. Received wisdom is a
full-grown eagle by comparison. So it's easy to launch a devastating
attack on a new idea, and anyone who does will seem clever to those
who don't understand this asymmetry.<br><br>This phenomenon is exacerbated by the difference between how those
working on new ideas and those attacking them are rewarded. The
rewards for working on new ideas are weighted by the value of the
outcome. So it's worth working on something that only has a 10%
chance of succeeding if it would make things more than 10x better.
Whereas the rewards for attacking new ideas are roughly constant;
such attacks seem roughly equally clever regardless of the target.<br><br>People will also attack new ideas when they have a vested interest
in the old ones. It's not surprising, for example, that some of
Darwin's harshest critics were churchmen. People build whole careers
on some ideas. When someone claims they're false or obsolete, they
feel threatened.<br><br>The lowest form of dismissal is mere factionalism: to automatically
dismiss any idea associated with the opposing faction. The lowest
form of all is to dismiss an idea because of who proposed it.<br><br>But the main thing that leads reasonable people to dismiss new ideas
is the same thing that holds people back from proposing them: the
sheer pervasiveness of the current paradigm. It doesn't just affect
the way we think; it is the Lego blocks we build thoughts out of.
Popping out of the current paradigm is something only a few people
can do. And even they usually have to suppress their intuitions at
first, like a pilot flying through cloud who has to trust his
instruments over his sense of balance.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Paradigms don't just define our present thinking. They also vacuum
up the trail of crumbs that led to them, making our standards for
new ideas impossibly high. The current paradigm seems so perfect
to us, its offspring, that we imagine it must have been accepted
completely as soon as it was discovered — that whatever the church thought
of the heliocentric model, astronomers must have been convinced as
soon as Copernicus proposed it. Far, in fact, from it. Copernicus
published the heliocentric model in 1532, but it wasn't till the
mid seventeenth century that the balance of scientific opinion
shifted in its favor.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#dddddd">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Few understand how feeble new ideas look when they first appear.
So if you want to have new ideas yourself, one of the most valuable
things you can do is to learn what they look like when they're born.
Read about how new ideas happened, and try to get yourself into the
heads of people at the time. How did things look to them, when the
new idea was only half-finished, and even the person who had it was
only half-convinced it was right?<br><br>But you don't have to stop at history. You can observe big new ideas
being born all around you right now. Just look for a reasonable
domain expert proposing something that sounds wrong.<br><br>If you're nice, as well as wise, you won't merely resist attacking
such people, but encourage them. Having new ideas is a lonely
business. Only those who've tried it know how lonely. These people
need your help. And if you help them, you'll probably learn something
in the process.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
This domain expertise could be in another field. Indeed,
such crossovers tend to be particularly promising.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
I'm not claiming this principle extends much beyond math,
engineering, and the hard sciences. In politics, for example,
crazy-sounding ideas generally are as bad as they sound. Though
arguably this is not an exception, because the people who propose
them are not in fact domain experts; politicians are domain experts
in political tactics, like how to get elected and how to get
legislation passed, but not in the world that policy acts upon.
Perhaps no one could be.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
This sense of "paradigm" was defined by Thomas Kuhn in his
<i>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>, but I also recommend his
<i>Copernican Revolution</i>, where you can see him at work developing the
idea.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
This is one reason people with a touch of Asperger's may have
an advantage in discovering new ideas. They're always flying on
instruments.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]

In ordinary
social situations they are — as quiet and diffident as the star
quarterback would be if he found himself in the middle of a physics
symposium. And for the same reason: they are fish out of water.
But the apparent diffidence of nerds is an illusion due to the fact
that when non-nerds observe them, it's usually in ordinary social
situations. In fact some nerds are quite fierce.<br><br>The fierce nerds are a small but interesting group. They are as a
rule extremely competitive — more competitive, I'd say, than highly
competitive non-nerds. Competition is more personal for them. Partly
perhaps because they're not emotionally mature enough to distance
themselves from it, but also because there's less randomness in the
kinds of competition they engage in, and they are thus more justified
in taking the results personally.<br><br>Fierce nerds also tend to be somewhat overconfident, especially
when young. It might seem like it would be a disadvantage to be
mistaken about one's abilities, but empirically it isn't. Up to a
point, confidence is a self-fullfilling prophecy.<br><br>Another quality you find in most fierce nerds is intelligence. Not
all nerds are smart, but the fierce ones are always at least
moderately so. If they weren't, they wouldn't have the confidence
to be fierce.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>There's also a natural connection between nerdiness and
<a href="think.html"><u>independent-mindedness</u></a>. It's hard to be 
independent-minded without
being somewhat socially awkward, because conventional beliefs are
so often mistaken, or at least arbitrary. No one who was both
independent-minded and ambitious would want to waste the effort it
takes to fit in. And the independent-mindedness of the fierce nerds
will obviously be of the <a href="conformism.html"><u>aggressive</u></a> 
rather than the passive type:
they'll be annoyed by rules, rather than dreamily unaware of them.<br><br>I'm less sure why fierce nerds are impatient, but most seem to be.
You notice it first in conversation, where they tend to interrupt
you. This is merely annoying, but in the more promising fierce nerds
it's connected to a deeper impatience about solving problems. Perhaps
the competitiveness and impatience of fierce nerds are not separate 
qualities, but two manifestations of a single underlying drivenness.<br><br>When you combine all these qualities in sufficient quantities, the
result is quite formidable. The most vivid example of fierce nerds
in action may be James Watson's <i>The Double Helix</i>. The first sentence
of the book is "I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood,"
and the portrait he goes on to paint of Crick is the quintessential
fierce nerd: brilliant, socially awkward, competitive, independent-minded,
overconfident. But so is the implicit portrait he paints of himself.
Indeed, his lack of social awareness makes both portraits that much
more realistic, because he baldly states all sorts of opinions and
motivations that a smoother person would conceal. And moreover it's
clear from the story that Crick and Watson's fierce nerdiness was
integral to their success. Their independent-mindedness caused them
to consider approaches that most others ignored, their overconfidence
allowed them to work on problems they only half understood (they
were literally described as "clowns" by one eminent insider), and
their impatience and competitiveness got them to the answer ahead
of two other groups that would otherwise have found it within the
next year, if not the next several months.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The idea that there could be fierce nerds is an unfamiliar one not
just to many normal people but even to some young nerds. Especially
early on, nerds spend so much of their time in ordinary social
situations and so little doing real work that they get a lot more
evidence of their awkwardness than their power. So there will be
some who read this description of the fierce nerd and realize "Hmm,
that's me." And it is to you, young fierce nerd, that I now turn.<br><br>I have some good news, and some bad news. The good news is that
your fierceness will be a great help in solving difficult problems.
And not just the kind of scientific and technical problems that
nerds have traditionally solved. As the world progresses, the number
of things you can win at by getting the right answer increases.
Recently <a href="richnow.html"><u>getting rich</u></a> became 
one of them: 7 of the 8 richest people
in America are now fierce nerds.<br><br>Indeed, being a fierce nerd is probably even more helpful in business
than in nerds' original territory of scholarship. Fierceness seems
optional there. Darwin for example doesn't seem to have been
especially fierce. Whereas it's impossible to be the CEO of a company
over a certain size without being fierce, so now that nerds can win
at business, fierce nerds will increasingly monopolize the really
big successes.<br><br>The bad news is that if it's not exercised, your fierceness will
turn to bitterness, and you will become an intellectual playground
bully: the grumpy sysadmin, the forum troll, the 
<a href="fh.html"><u>hater</u></a>, the shooter
down of <a href="newideas.html"><u>new ideas</u></a>.<br><br>How do you avoid this fate? Work on ambitious projects. If you
succeed, it will bring you a kind of satisfaction that neutralizes
bitterness. But you don't need to have succeeded to feel this;
merely working on hard projects gives most fierce nerds some
feeling of satisfaction. And those it doesn't, it at least keeps
busy.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another solution may be to somehow turn off your fierceness, by
devoting yourself to meditation or psychotherapy or something like
that. Maybe that's the right answer for some people. I have no idea.
But it doesn't seem the optimal solution to me. If you're given a
sharp knife, it seems to me better to use it than to blunt its edge
to avoid cutting yourself.<br><br>If you do choose the ambitious route, you'll have a tailwind behind
you. There has never been a better time to be a nerd. In the past
century we've seen a continuous transfer of power from dealmakers
to technicians — from the charismatic to the competent — and I
don't see anything on the horizon that will end it. At least not
till the nerds end it themselves by bringing about the singularity.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
To be a nerd is to be socially awkward, and there are two
distinct ways to do that: to be playing the same game as everyone
else, but badly, and to be playing a different game. The smart nerds
are the latter type.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
The same qualities that make fierce nerds so effective can
also make them very annoying. Fierce nerds would do well to remember
this, and (a) try to keep a lid on it, and (b) seek out organizations
and types of work where getting the right answer matters more than
preserving social harmony. In practice that means small groups
working on hard problems. Which fortunately is the most fun kind
of environment anyway.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
If success neutralizes bitterness, why are there some people
who are at least moderately successful and yet still quite bitter?
Because people's potential bitterness varies depending on how
naturally bitter their personality is, and how ambitious they are:
someone who's naturally very bitter will still have a lot left after
success neutralizes some of it, and someone who's very ambitious
will need proportionally more success to satisfy that ambition.<br><br>So the worst-case scenario is someone who's both naturally bitter

told me he couldn't wait to get home to write more of the story he
was working on. This made me as happy as anything I've heard him
say — not just because he was excited about his story, but because
he'd discovered this way of working. Working on a project of your
own is as different from ordinary work as skating is from walking.
It's more fun, but also much more productive.<br><br>What proportion of great work has been done by people who were
skating in this sense? If not all of it, certainly a lot.<br><br>There is something special about working on a project of your own.
I wouldn't say exactly that you're happier. A better word would be
excited, or engaged. You're happy when things are going well, but
often they aren't. When I'm writing an essay, most of the time I'm
worried and puzzled: worried that the essay will turn out badly,
and puzzled because I'm groping for some idea that I can't see
clearly enough. Will I be able to pin it down with words? In the
end I usually can, if I take long enough, but I'm never sure; the
first few attempts often fail.<br><br>You have moments of happiness when things work out, but they don't
last long, because then you're on to the next problem. So why do
it at all? Because to the kind of people who like working this way,
nothing else feels as right. You feel as if you're an animal in its
natural habitat, doing what you were meant to do — not always
happy, maybe, but awake and alive.<br><br>Many kids experience the excitement of working on projects of their
own. The hard part is making this converge with the work you do as
an adult. And our customs make it harder. We treat "playing" and
"hobbies" as qualitatively different from "work". It's not clear
to a kid building a treehouse that there's a direct (though long)
route from that to architecture or engineering. And instead of
pointing out the route, we conceal it, by implicitly treating the
stuff kids do as different from real work.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Instead of telling kids that their treehouses could be on the path
to the work they do as adults, we tell them the path goes through
school. And unfortunately schoolwork tends to be very different from
working on projects of one's own. It's usually neither a project,
nor one's own. So as school gets more serious, working on projects
of one's own is something that survives, if at all, as a thin thread
off to the side.<br><br>It's a bit sad to think of all the high school kids turning their
backs on building treehouses and sitting in class dutifully learning
about Darwin or Newton to pass some exam, when the work that made
Darwin and Newton famous was actually closer in spirit to building
treehouses than studying for exams.<br><br>If I had to choose between my kids getting good grades and 
working on ambitious projects of their own, I'd pick
the projects. And not because I'm an indulgent parent, but because
I've been on the other end and I know which has more predictive
value. When I was picking startups for Y Combinator, I didn't care
about applicants' grades. But if they'd worked on projects of their
own, I wanted to hear all about those.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>It may be inevitable that school is the way it is. I'm not saying
we have to redesign it (though I'm not saying we don't), just that
we should understand what it does to our attitudes to work — that
it steers us toward the dutiful plodding kind of work, often using
competition as bait, and away from skating.<br><br>There are occasionally times when schoolwork becomes a project of
one's own. Whenever I had to write a paper, that would become a
project of my own — except in English classes, ironically, because
the things one has to write in English classes are so 
<a href="essay.html"><u>bogus</u></a>. And
when I got to college and started taking CS classes, the programs
I had to write became projects of my own. Whenever I was writing
or programming, I was usually skating, and that has been true ever
since.<br><br>So where exactly is the edge of projects of one's own? That's an
interesting question, partly because the answer is so complicated,
and partly because there's so much at stake. There turn out to be
two senses in which work can be one's own: 1) that you're doing it
voluntarily, rather than merely because someone told you to, and
2) that you're doing it by yourself.<br><br>The edge of the former is quite sharp. People who care a lot about
their work are usually very sensitive to the difference between
pulling, and being pushed, and work tends to fall into one category
or the other. But the test isn't simply whether you're told to do
something. You can choose to do something you're told to do. Indeed,
you can own it far more thoroughly than the person who told you to
do it.<br><br>For example, math homework is for most people something they're
told to do. But for my father, who was a mathematician, it wasn't.
Most of us think of the problems in a math book as a way to test
or develop our knowledge of the material explained in each section.
But to my father the problems were the part that mattered, and the
text was merely a sort of annotation. Whenever he got a new math
book it was to him like being given a puzzle: here was a new set
of problems to solve, and he'd immediately set about solving all
of them.<br><br>The other sense of a project being one's own — working on it by
oneself — has a much softer edge. It shades gradually into
collaboration. And interestingly, it shades into collaboration in
two different ways. One way to collaborate is to share a single
project. For example, when two mathematicians collaborate on a proof
that takes shape in the course of a conversation between them. The
other way is when multiple people work on separate projects of their
own that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. For example, when one
person writes the text of a book and another does the graphic design.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>These two paths into collaboration can of course be combined. But
under the right conditions, the excitement of working on a project
of one's own can be preserved for quite a while before disintegrating
into the turbulent flow of work in a large organization. Indeed,
the history of successful organizations is partly the history of
techniques for preserving that excitement.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>The team that made the original Macintosh were a great example of
this phenomenon. People like Burrell Smith and Andy Hertzfeld and
Bill Atkinson and Susan Kare were not just following orders. They
were not tennis balls hit by Steve Jobs, but rockets let loose by
Steve Jobs. There was a lot of collaboration between them, but
they all seem to have individually felt the excitement of
working on a project of one's own.<br><br>In Andy Hertzfeld's book on the Macintosh, he describes how they'd
come back into the office after dinner and work late into the night.
People who've never experienced the thrill of working on a project
they're excited about can't distinguish this kind of working long
hours from the kind that happens in sweatshops and boiler rooms,
but they're at opposite ends of the spectrum. That's why it's a
mistake to insist dogmatically on "work/life balance." Indeed, the
mere expression "work/life" embodies a mistake: it assumes work and
life are distinct. For those to whom the word "work" automatically
implies the dutiful plodding kind, they are. But for the skaters,
the relationship between work and life would be better represented
by a dash than a slash. I wouldn't want to work on anything that I didn't
want to take over my life.<br><br>Of course, it's easier to achieve this level of motivation when
you're making something like the Macintosh. It's easy for something
new to feel like a project of your own. That's one of the reasons
for the tendency programmers have to rewrite things that don't need
rewriting, and to write their own versions of things that already
exist. This sometimes alarms managers, and measured by total number
of characters typed, it's rarely the optimal solution. But it's not
always driven simply by arrogance or cluelessness.
Writing code from scratch is also much more rewarding — so much
more rewarding that a good programmer can end up net ahead, despite
the shocking waste of characters. Indeed, it may be one of the
advantages of capitalism that it encourages such rewriting. A company
that needs software to do something can't use the software already
written to do it at another company, and thus has to write their
own, which often turns out better.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#dddddd">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>The natural alignment between skating and solving new problems is
one of the reasons the payoffs from startups are so high. Not only
is the market price of unsolved problems higher, you also get a
discount on productivity when you work on them. In fact, you get a
double increase in productivity: when you're doing a clean-sheet
design, it's easier to recruit skaters, and they get to spend all
their time skating.<br><br>Steve Jobs knew a thing or two about skaters from having watched
Steve Wozniak. If you can find the right people, you only have to
tell them what to do at the highest level. They'll handle the
details. Indeed, they insist on it. For a project to feel like your
own, you must have sufficient autonomy. You can't be working to
order, or <a href="artistsship.html"><u>slowed down</u></a> 
by bureaucracy.<br><br>One way to ensure autonomy is not to have a boss at all. There are
two ways to do that: to be the boss yourself, and to work on projects
outside of work. Though they're at opposite ends of the scale
financially, startups and open source projects have a lot in common,
including the fact that they're often run by skaters. And indeed,
there's a wormhole from one end of the scale to the other: one of
the best ways to discover 
<a href="startupideas.html"><u>startup ideas</u></a> is to work on a project
just for fun.<br><br>If your projects are the kind that make money, it's easy to work
on them. It's harder when they're not. And the hardest part, usually,
is morale. That's where adults have it harder than kids. Kids just
plunge in and build their treehouse without worrying about whether
they're wasting their time, or how it compares to other treehouses.
And frankly we could learn a lot from kids here. The high standards
most grownups have for "real" work do not always serve us well.<br><br>The most important phase in a project of one's own is at the
beginning: when you go from thinking it might be cool to do x to
actually doing x. And at that point high standards are not merely
useless but positively harmful. There are a few people who start
too many new projects, but far more, I suspect, who are deterred
by fear of failure from starting projects that would have succeeded
if they had.<br><br>But if we couldn't benefit as kids from the knowledge that our
treehouses were on the path to grownup projects, we can at least
benefit as grownups from knowing that our projects are on a path
that stretches back to treehouses. Remember that careless confidence
you had as a kid when starting something new? That would be a
powerful thing to recapture.<br><br>If it's harder as adults to retain that kind of confidence, we at
least tend to be more aware of what we're doing. Kids bounce, or
are herded, from one kind of work to the next, barely realizing
what's happening to them. Whereas we know more about different types
of work and have more control over which we do. Ideally we can have
the best of both worlds: to be deliberate in choosing to work on
projects of our own, and carelessly confident in starting new ones.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
"Hobby" is a curious word. Now it means work that isn't <i>real</i>
work — work that one is not to be judged by — but originally it just
meant an obsession in a fairly general sense (even a political
opinion, for example) that one metaphorically rode as a child rides
a hobby-horse. It's hard to say if its recent, narrower meaning is
a change for the better or the worse. For sure there are lots of
false positives — lots of projects that end up being important but
are dismissed initially as mere hobbies. But on the other hand, the
concept provides valuable cover for projects in the early, ugly
duckling phase.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Tiger parents, as parents so often do, are fighting the last
war. Grades mattered more in the old days when the route to success
was to acquire 
<a href="credentials.html"><u>credentials</u></a> 
while ascending some predefined ladder.
But it's just as well that their tactics are focused on grades. How
awful it would be if they invaded the territory of projects, and
thereby gave their kids a distaste for this kind of work by forcing
them to do it. Grades are already a grim, fake world, and aren't
harmed much by parental interference, but working on one's own
projects is a more delicate, private thing that could be damaged
very easily.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The complicated, gradual edge between working on one's own
projects and collaborating with others is one reason there is so
much disagreement about the idea of the "lone genius." In practice
people collaborate (or not) in all kinds of different ways, but the
idea of the lone genius is definitely not a myth. There's a core
of truth to it that goes with a certain way of working.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Collaboration is powerful too. The optimal organization would
combine collaboration and ownership in such a way as to do the least
damage to each. Interestingly, companies and university departments
approach this ideal from opposite directions: companies insist on
collaboration, and occasionally also manage both to recruit skaters
and allow them to skate, and university departments insist on the
ability to do independent research (which is by custom treated as
skating, whether it is or not), and the people they hire collaborate
as much as they choose.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
If a company could design its software in such a way that the
best newly arrived programmers always got a clean sheet, it could
have a kind of eternal youth. That might not be impossible. If you
had a software backbone defining a game with sufficiently clear
rules, individual programmers could write their own players.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Anyone who's been to school knows what it entails, even if they
chose not to do it. There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. And
yet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when I
was in school, the answer is definitely yes.<br><br>One thing I know is that if you want to do great things, you'll
have to work very hard. I wasn't sure of that as a kid. Schoolwork
varied in difficulty; one didn't always have to work super hard to
do well. And some of the things famous adults did, they seemed to
do almost effortlessly. Was there, perhaps, some way to evade hard
work through sheer brilliance? Now I know the answer to that question.
There isn't.<br><br>The reason some subjects seemed easy was that my school had low
standards. And the reason famous adults seemed to do things
effortlessly was years of practice; they made it look easy.<br><br>Of course, those famous adults usually had a lot of natural ability
too. There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability,
practice, and effort. You can do pretty well with just two, but to
do the best work you need all three: you need great natural ability
<i>and</i> to have practiced a lot <i>and</i> to be trying very hard. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Bill Gates, for example, was among the smartest people in business
in his era, but he was also among the hardest working. "I never
took a day off in my twenties," he said. "Not one." It was similar
with Lionel Messi. He had great natural ability, but when his youth
coaches talk about him, what they remember is not his talent but
his dedication and his desire to win. P. G. Wodehouse would probably
get my vote for best English writer of the 20th century, if I had
to choose. Certainly no one ever made it look easier. But no one
ever worked harder. At 74, he wrote
<blockquote>
  with each new book of mine I have, as I say, the feeling that
  this time I have picked a lemon in the garden of literature. A
  good thing, really, I suppose. Keeps one up on one's toes and
  makes one rewrite every sentence ten times. Or in many cases
  twenty times.
</blockquote>
Sounds a bit extreme, you think. And yet Bill Gates sounds even
more extreme. Not one day off in ten years?  These two had about
as much natural ability as anyone could have, and yet they also
worked about as hard as anyone could work. You need both.<br><br>That seems so obvious, and yet in practice we find it slightly hard
to grasp. There's a faint xor between talent and hard work. It comes
partly from popular culture, where it seems to run very deep, and
partly from the fact that the outliers are so rare. If great talent
and great drive are both rare, then people with both are rare
squared. Most people you meet who have a lot of one will have less
of the other. But you'll need both if you want to be an outlier
yourself. And since you can't really change how much natural talent
you have, in practice doing great work, insofar as you can, reduces
to working very hard.<br><br>It's straightforward to work hard if you have clearly defined,
externally imposed goals, as you do in school. There is some technique
to it: you have to learn not to lie to yourself, not to procrastinate
(which is a form of lying to yourself), not to get distracted, and
not to give up when things go wrong. But this level of discipline
seems to be within the reach of quite young children, if they want
it.<br><br>What I've learned since I was a kid is how to work toward goals
that are neither clearly defined nor externally imposed. You'll
probably have to learn both if you want to do really great things.<br><br>The most basic level of which is simply to feel you should be working
without anyone telling you to. Now, when I'm not working hard, alarm
bells go off. I can't be sure I'm getting anywhere when I'm working
hard, but I can be sure I'm getting nowhere when I'm not, and it
feels awful.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>There wasn't a single point when I learned this. Like most little
kids, I enjoyed the feeling of achievement when I learned or did
something new. As I grew older, this morphed into a feeling of
disgust when I wasn't achieving anything. The one precisely dateable
landmark I have is when I stopped watching TV, at age&nbsp;13.<br><br>Several people I've talked to remember getting serious about work
around this age. When I asked Patrick Collison when he started to
find idleness distasteful, he said
<blockquote>
  I think around age 13 or 14. I have a clear memory from around
  then of sitting in the sitting room, staring outside, and wondering
  why I was wasting my summer holiday.
</blockquote>
Perhaps something changes at adolescence. That would make sense.<br><br>Strangely enough, the biggest obstacle to getting serious about
work was probably school, which made work (what they called work)
seem boring and pointless. I had to learn what real work was before
I could wholeheartedly desire to do it. That took a while, because
even in college a lot of the work is pointless; there are entire
departments that are pointless. But as I learned the shape of real
work, I found that my desire to do it slotted into it as if they'd
been made for each other.<br><br>I suspect most people have to learn what work is before they can
love it. Hardy wrote eloquently about this in <i>A Mathematician's
Apology</i>:
<blockquote>
  I do not remember having felt, as a boy, any <i>passion</i> for
  mathematics, and such notions as I may have had of the career of
  a mathematician were far from noble. I thought of mathematics in
  terms of examinations and scholarships: I wanted to beat other
  boys, and this seemed to be the way in which I could do so most
  decisively.
</blockquote>
He didn't learn what math was really about till part way through
college, when he read Jordan's <i>Cours d'analyse</i>.
<blockquote>
  I shall never forget the astonishment with which I read that
  remarkable work, the first inspiration for so many mathematicians
  of my generation, and learnt for the first time as I read it what
  mathematics really meant.
</blockquote>
There are two separate kinds of fakeness you need to learn to
discount in order to understand what real work is. One is the kind
Hardy encountered in school. Subjects get distorted when they're
adapted to be taught to kids — often so distorted that they're
nothing like the work done by actual practitioners.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font>
The other
kind of fakeness is intrinsic to certain types of work. Some types
of work are inherently bogus, or at best mere busywork.<br><br>There's a kind of solidity to real work. It's not all writing the
<i>Principia</i>, but it all feels necessary. That's a vague criterion,
but it's deliberately vague, because it has to cover a lot of
different types.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Once you know the shape of real work, you have to learn how many
hours a day to spend on it. You can't solve this problem by simply
working every waking hour, because in many kinds of work there's a
point beyond which the quality of the result will start to decline.<br><br>That limit varies depending on the type of work and the person.
I've done several different kinds of work, and the limits were
different for each. My limit for the harder types of writing or
programming is about five hours a day. Whereas when I was running
a startup, I could
work all the time. At least for the three years I did it; if I'd
kept going much longer, I'd probably have needed to take occasional
vacations.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#dddddd">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>The only way to find the limit is by crossing it. Cultivate a
sensitivity to the quality of the work you're doing, and then you'll
notice if it decreases because you're working too hard. Honesty is
critical here, in both directions: you have to notice when you're
being lazy, but also when you're working too hard. And if you think
there's something admirable about working too hard, get that idea
out of your head. You're not merely getting worse results, but
getting them because you're showing off — if not to other people,
then to yourself.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#dddddd">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Finding the limit of working hard is a constant, ongoing process,
not something you do just once. Both the difficulty of the work and
your ability to do it can vary hour to hour, so you need to be
constantly judging both how hard you're trying and how well you're
doing.<br><br>Trying hard doesn't mean constantly pushing yourself to work, though.
There may be some people who do, but I think my experience is fairly
typical, and I only have to push myself occasionally when I'm
starting a project or when I encounter some sort of check. That's
when I'm in danger of procrastinating. But once I get rolling, I
tend to keep going.<br><br>What keeps me going depends on the type of work. When I was working
on Viaweb, I was driven by fear of failure. I barely procrastinated
at all then, because there was always something that needed doing,
and if I could put more distance between me and the pursuing beast
by doing it, why wait? <font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#dddddd">7</font></a>]</font>
Whereas what drives me now, writing
essays, is the flaws in them. Between essays I fuss for a few days,
like a dog circling while it decides exactly where to lie down. But
once I get started on one, I don't have to push myself to work,
because there's always some error or omission already pushing me.<br><br>I do make some amount of effort to focus on important topics. Many
problems have a hard core at the center, surrounded by easier stuff
at the edges. Working hard means aiming toward the center to the
extent you can. Some days you may not be able to; some days you'll
only be able to work on the easier, peripheral stuff. But you should
always be aiming as close to the center as you can without stalling.<br><br>The bigger question of what to do with your life is one of these
problems with a hard core. There are important problems at the
center, which tend to be hard, and less important, easier ones at
the edges. So as well as the small, daily adjustments involved in
working on a specific problem, you'll occasionally have to make
big, lifetime-scale adjustments about which type of work to do.
And the rule is the same: working hard means aiming toward the
center — toward the most ambitious problems.<br><br>By center, though, I mean the actual center, not merely the current
consensus about the center. The consensus about which problems are
most important is often mistaken, both in general and within specific
fields. If you disagree with it, and you're right, that could
represent a valuable opportunity to do something new.<br><br>The more ambitious types of work will usually be harder, but although
you should not be in denial about this, neither should you treat
difficulty as an infallible guide in deciding what to do. If you
discover some ambitious type of work that's a bargain in the sense
of being easier for you than other people, either because of the
abilities you happen to have, or because of some new way you've
found to approach it, or simply because you're more excited about
it, by all means work on that. Some of the best work is done by
people who find an easy way to do something hard.<br><br>As well as learning the shape of real work, you need to figure out
which kind you're suited for. And that doesn't just mean figuring
out which kind your natural abilities match the best; it doesn't
mean that if you're 7 feet tall, you have to play basketball. What
you're suited for depends not just on your talents but perhaps even
more on your interests. A <a href="genius.html"><u>deep interest</u></a> 
in a topic makes people
work harder than any amount of discipline can.<br><br>It can be harder to discover your interests than your talents.
There are fewer types of talent than interest, and they start to
be judged early in childhood, whereas interest in a topic is a
subtle thing that may not mature till your twenties, or even later.
The topic may not even exist earlier. Plus there are some powerful
sources of error you need to learn to discount. Are you really
interested in x, or do you want to work on it because you'll make
a lot of money, or because other people will be impressed with you,
or because your parents want you to?
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#dddddd">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>The difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormously
from one person to another. That's one of the most important things
I've learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get the
impression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do is
figure out what it is. That's how it works in movies, and in the
streamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that way
in real life. Some people figure out what to do as children and
just do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlessly
from one kind of work to another. Maybe in retrospect we can identify
one as their calling — we can wish Newton spent more time on math
and physics and less on alchemy and theology — but this is an
<a href="disc.html"><u>illusion</u></a> induced by hindsight bias. 
There was no voice calling to him that he could have heard.<br><br>So while some people's lives converge fast, there will be others
whose lives never converge. And for these people, figuring out what
to work on is not so much a prelude to working hard as an ongoing
part of it, like one of a set of simultaneous equations. For these
people, the process I described earlier has a third component: along
with measuring both how hard you're working and how well you're
doing, you have to think about whether you should keep working in
this field or switch to another. If you're working hard but not
getting good enough results, you should switch. It sounds simple
expressed that way, but in practice it's very difficult. You shouldn't
give up on the first day just because you work hard and don't get
anywhere. You need to give yourself time to get going. But how much
time? And what should you do if work that was going well stops going
well? How much time do you give yourself then?
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#dddddd">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>What even counts as good results? That can be really hard to decide.
If you're exploring an area few others have worked in, you may not
even know what good results look like. History is full of examples
of people who misjudged the importance of what they were working
on.<br><br>The best test of whether it's worthwhile to work on something is
whether you find it interesting. That may sound like a dangerously
subjective measure, but it's probably the most accurate one you're
going to get. You're the one working on the stuff. Who's in a better
position than you to judge whether it's important, and what's a
better predictor of its importance than whether it's interesting?<br><br>For this test to work, though, you have to be honest with yourself.
Indeed, that's the most striking thing about the whole question of
working hard: how at each point it depends on being honest with
yourself.<br><br>Working hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It's a complicated,
dynamic system that has to be tuned just right at each point. You
have to understand the shape of real work, see clearly what kind
you're best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as you
can, accurately judge at each moment both what you're capable of
and how you're doing, and put in as many hours each day as you can
without harming the quality of the result. This network is too
complicated to trick. But if you're consistently honest and
clear-sighted, it will automatically assume an optimal shape, and
you'll be productive in a way few people are.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
In "The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius" I said the three ingredients
in great work were natural ability, determination, and interest.
That's the formula in the preceding stage; determination and interest
yield practice and effort.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
I mean this at a resolution of days, not hours. You'll often
get somewhere while not working in the sense that the solution to
a problem comes to you while taking a 
<a href="top.html"><u>shower</u></a>, or even in your sleep,
but only because you were working hard on it the day before.<br><br>It's good to go on vacation occasionally, but when I go on vacation,
I like to learn new things. I wouldn't like just sitting on a beach.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The thing kids do in school that's most like the real version
is sports. Admittedly because many sports originated as games played
in schools. But in this one area, at least, kids are doing exactly
what adults do.<br><br>In the average American high school, you have a choice of pretending
to do something serious, or seriously doing something pretend.
Arguably the latter is no worse.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Knowing what you want to work on doesn't mean you'll be able
to. Most people have to spend a lot of their time working on things
they don't want to, especially early on. But if you know what you
want to do, you at least know what direction to nudge your life in.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
The lower time limits for intense work suggest a solution to
the problem of having less time to work after you have kids: switch
to harder problems. In effect I did that, though not deliberately.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Some cultures have a tradition of performative hard work. I
don't love this idea, because (a) it makes a parody of something
important and (b) it causes people to wear themselves out doing
things that don't matter. I don't know enough to say for sure whether
it's net good or bad, but my guess is bad.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
One of the reasons people work so hard on startups is that
startups can fail, and when they do, that failure tends to be both
decisive and conspicuous.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
It's ok to work on something to make a lot of money. You need
to solve the money problem somehow, and there's nothing wrong with
doing that efficiently by trying to make a lot at once. I suppose
it would even be ok to be interested in money for its own sake;
whatever floats your boat. Just so long as you're conscious of your
motivations. The thing to avoid is <i>unconsciously</i> letting the need
for money warp your ideas about what kind of work you find most
interesting.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Many people face this question on a smaller scale with
individual projects. But it's easier both to recognize and to accept
a dead end in a single project than to abandon some type of work
entirely. The more determined you are, the harder it gets. Like a
Spanish Flu victim, you're fighting your own immune system: Instead
of giving up, you tell yourself, I should just try harder. And who
can say you're not right?<br><br><br><br>

are basically equivalent, they're making a statement not about
languages but about the kind of programming they've done.<br><br>99.5% of programming consists of gluing together calls to library
functions. All popular languages are equally good at this. So one
can easily spend one's whole career operating in the intersection
of popular programming languages.<br><br>But the other .5% of programming is disproportionately interesting.
If you want to learn what it consists of, the weirdness of weird
languages is a good clue to follow.<br><br>Weird languages aren't weird by accident. Not the good ones, at
least. The weirdness of the good ones usually implies the existence
of some form of programming that's not just the usual gluing together
of library calls.<br><br>A concrete example: Lisp macros. Lisp macros seem weird even to
many Lisp programmers. They're not only not in the intersection of
popular languages, but by their nature would be hard to implement
properly in a language without turning it into a dialect of
Lisp. And macros are definitely evidence of techniques that go
beyond glue programming. For example, solving problems by first
writing a language for problems of that type, and then writing
your specific application in it. Nor is this all you can do with
macros; it's just one region in a space of program-manipulating
techniques that even now is far from fully explored.<br><br>So if you want to expand your concept of what programming can be,
one way to do it is by learning weird languages. Pick a language
that most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smart,
and then focus on the differences between this language and the
intersection of popular languages. What can you say in this language
that would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? In the
process of learning how to say things you couldn't previously say,
you'll probably be learning how to think things you couldn't
previously think.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><font color="888888">

that he was really smart. Even the ones who tried to give you a
more sophisticated-sounding answer would probably think this first.
Till a few years ago I would have given the same answer myself. But
that wasn't what was special about Einstein. What was special about
him was that he had important new ideas. Being very smart was a
necessary precondition for having those ideas, but the two are not
identical.<br><br>It may seem a hair-splitting distinction to point out that intelligence
and its consequences are not identical, but it isn't. There's a big
gap between them. Anyone who's spent time around universities and
research labs knows how big. There are a lot of genuinely smart
people who don't achieve very much.<br><br>I grew up thinking that being smart was the thing most to be desired.
Perhaps you did too. But I bet it's not what you really want. Imagine
you had a choice between being really smart but discovering nothing
new, and being less smart but discovering lots of new ideas. Surely
you'd take the latter. I would. The choice makes me uncomfortable,
but when you see the two options laid out explicitly like that,
it's obvious which is better.<br><br>The reason the choice makes me uncomfortable is that being smart
still feels like the thing that matters, even though I know
intellectually that it isn't. I spent so many years thinking it
was. The circumstances of childhood are a perfect storm for fostering
this illusion. Intelligence is much easier to measure than the value
of new ideas, and you're constantly being judged by it. Whereas
even the kids who will ultimately discover new things aren't usually
discovering them yet. For kids that way inclined, intelligence is
the only game in town.<br><br>There are more subtle reasons too, which persist long into adulthood.
Intelligence wins in conversation, and thus becomes the basis of
the dominance hierarchy.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font>
Plus having new ideas is such a new
thing historically, and even now done by so few people, that society
hasn't yet assimilated the fact that this is the actual destination,
and intelligence merely a means to an end.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Why do so many smart people fail to discover anything new? Viewed
from that direction, the question seems a rather depressing one.
But there's another way to look at it that's not just more optimistic,
but more interesting as well. Clearly intelligence is not the only
ingredient in having new ideas. What are the other ingredients?
Are they things we could cultivate?<br><br>Because the trouble with intelligence, they say, is that it's mostly
inborn. The evidence for this seems fairly convincing, especially
considering that most of us don't want it to be true, and the
evidence thus has to face a stiff headwind. But I'm not going
to get into that question here, because it's the other ingredients
in new ideas that I care about, and it's clear that many of them
can be cultivated.<br><br>That means the truth is excitingly different from the story I got
as a kid. If intelligence is what matters, and also mostly inborn,
the natural consequence is a sort of <i>Brave New World</i> fatalism. The
best you can do is figure out what sort of work you have an "aptitude"
for, so that whatever intelligence you were born with will at least
be put to the best use, and then work as hard as you can at it.
Whereas if intelligence isn't what matters, but only one of several
ingredients in what does, and many of those aren't inborn, things
get more interesting. You have a lot more control, but the problem
of how to arrange your life becomes that much more complicated.<br><br>So what are the other ingredients in having new ideas? The fact
that I can even ask this question proves the point I raised earlier
— that society hasn't assimilated the fact that it's this and not
intelligence that matters. Otherwise we'd all know the answers
to such a fundamental question.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>I'm not going to try to provide a complete catalogue of the other
ingredients here. This is the first time I've posed
the question to myself this way, and I think it may take a while
to answer. But I wrote recently about one of the most important:
an obsessive <a href="genius.html"><u>interest</u></a> in a particular topic. 
And this can definitely be cultivated.<br><br>Another quality you need in order to discover new ideas is
<a href="think.html"><u>independent-mindedness</u></a>. I wouldn't want to 
claim that this is
distinct from intelligence — I'd be reluctant to call someone smart
who wasn't independent-minded — but though largely inborn, this
quality seems to be something that can be cultivated to some extent.<br><br>There are general techniques for having new ideas — for example,
for working on your own <a href="own.html"><u>projects</u></a>
and
for overcoming the obstacles you face with <a href="early.html"><u>early</u></a> work
— and these
can all be learned. Some of them can be learned by societies. And
there are also collections of techniques for generating specific types
of new ideas, like <a href="startupideas.html">startup ideas</a> and 
<a href="essay.html">essay topics</a>.<br><br>And of course there are a lot of fairly mundane ingredients in
discovering new ideas, like <a href="hwh.html"><u>working hard</u></a>, 
getting enough sleep, avoiding certain
kinds of stress, having the right colleagues, and finding tricks
for working on what you want even when it's not what you're supposed
to be working on. Anything that prevents people from doing great
work has an inverse that helps them to. And this class of ingredients
is not as boring as it might seem at first. For example, having new
ideas is generally associated with youth. But perhaps it's not youth
per se that yields new ideas, but specific things that come with
youth, like good health and lack of responsibilities. Investigating
this might lead to strategies that will help people of any age to
have better ideas.<br><br>One of the most surprising ingredients in having new ideas is writing
ability. There's a class of new ideas that are best discovered by
writing essays and books. And that "by" is deliberate: you don't
think of the ideas first, and then merely write them down. There
is a kind of thinking that one does by writing, and if you're clumsy
at writing, or don't enjoy doing it, that will get in your way if
you try to do this kind of thinking.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>I predict the gap between intelligence and new ideas will turn out
to be an interesting place. If we think of this gap merely as a measure
of unrealized potential, it becomes a sort of wasteland that we try to
hurry through with our eyes averted. But if we flip the question,
and start inquiring into the other ingredients in new ideas that
it implies must exist, we can mine this gap for discoveries about
discovery.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
What wins in conversation depends on who with. It ranges from
mere aggressiveness at the bottom, through quick-wittedness in the
middle, to something closer to actual intelligence at the top,
though probably always with some component of quick-wittedness.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Just as intelligence isn't the only ingredient in having new
ideas, having new ideas isn't the only thing intelligence is useful
for. It's also useful, for example, in diagnosing problems and figuring
out how to fix them. Both overlap with having new ideas, but both
have an end that doesn't.<br><br>Those ways of using intelligence are much more common than having
new ideas. And in such cases intelligence is even harder to distinguish
from its consequences.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Some would attribute the difference between intelligence and
having new ideas to "creativity," but this doesn't seem a very
useful term. As well as being pretty vague, it's shifted half a frame
sideways from what we care about: it's neither separable from
intelligence, nor responsible for all the difference between
intelligence and having new ideas.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Curiously enough, this essay is an example. It started out
as an essay about writing ability. But when I came to the distinction
between intelligence and having new ideas, that seemed so much more
important that I turned the original essay inside out, making that
the topic and my original topic one of the points in it. As in many
other fields, that level of reworking is easier to contemplate once
you've had a lot of practice.<br><br><br><br><font color="888888">

My father told me so.
Some people like some things, and other people like other things,
and who's to say who's right?<br><br>It seemed so obvious that there was no such thing as good taste
that it was only through indirect evidence that I realized my father
was wrong. And that's what I'm going to give you here: a proof by
reductio ad absurdum. If we start from the premise that there's no
such thing as good taste, we end up with conclusions that are
obviously false, and therefore the premise must be wrong.<br><br>We'd better start by saying what good taste is. There's a narrow
sense in which it refers to aesthetic judgements and a broader one
in which it refers to preferences of any kind. The strongest proof
would be to show that taste exists in the narrowest sense, so I'm
going to talk about taste in art. You have better taste than me if
the art you like is better than the art I like.<br><br>If there's no such thing as good taste, then there's no such thing
as <a href="goodart.html"><u>good art</u></a>. Because if there is such a
thing as good art, it's
easy to tell which of two people has better taste. Show them a lot
of works by artists they've never seen before and ask them to
choose the best, and whoever chooses the better art has better
taste.<br><br>So if you want to discard the concept of good taste, you also have
to discard the concept of good art. And that means you have to
discard the possibility of people being good at making it. Which
means there's no way for artists to be good at their jobs. And not
just visual artists, but anyone who is in any sense an artist. You
can't have good actors, or novelists, or composers, or dancers
either. You can have popular novelists, but not good ones.<br><br>We don't realize how far we'd have to go if we discarded the concept
of good taste, because we don't even debate the most obvious cases.
But it doesn't just mean we can't say which of two famous painters
is better. It means we can't say that any painter is better than a
randomly chosen eight year old.<br><br>That was how I realized my father was wrong. I started studying
painting. And it was just like other kinds of work I'd done: you
could do it well, or badly, and if you tried hard, you could get
better at it. And it was obvious that Leonardo and Bellini were
much better at it than me. That gap between us was not imaginary.
They were so good. And if they could be good, then art could be
good, and there was such a thing as good taste after all.<br><br>Now that I've explained how to show there is such a thing as good
taste, I should also explain why people think there isn't. There
are two reasons. One is that there's always so much disagreement
about taste. Most people's response to art is a tangle of unexamined
impulses. Is the artist famous? Is the subject attractive? Is this
the sort of art they're supposed to like? Is it hanging in a famous
museum, or reproduced in a big, expensive book? In practice most
people's response to art is dominated by such extraneous factors.<br><br>And the people who do claim to have good taste are so often mistaken.
The paintings admired by the so-called experts in one generation
are often so different from those admired a few generations later.
It's easy to conclude there's nothing real there at all. It's only
when you isolate this force, for example by trying to paint and
comparing your work to Bellini's, that you can see that it does in
fact exist.<br><br>The other reason people doubt that art can be good is that there
doesn't seem to be any room in the art for this goodness. The
argument goes like this. Imagine several people looking at a work
of art and judging how good it is. If being good art really is a
property of objects, it should be in the object somehow. But it
doesn't seem to be; it seems to be something happening in the heads
of each of the observers. And if they disagree, how do you choose
between them?<br><br>The solution to this puzzle is to realize that the purpose of art
is to work on its human audience, and humans have a lot in common.
And to the extent the things an object acts upon respond in the
same way, that's arguably what it means for the object to have the
corresponding property. If everything a particle interacts with
behaves as if the particle had a mass of <i>m</i>, then it has a mass of
<i>m</i>. So the distinction between "objective" and "subjective" is not
binary, but a matter of degree, depending on how much the subjects
have in common. Particles interacting with one another are at one
pole, but people interacting with art are not all the way at the
other; their reactions aren't <i>random</i>.<br><br>Because people's responses to art aren't random, art can be designed
to operate on people, and be good or bad depending on how effectively
it does so. Much as a vaccine can be. If someone were talking about
the ability of a vaccine to confer immunity, it would seem very
frivolous to object that conferring immunity wasn't really a property
of vaccines, because acquiring immunity is something that happens
in the immune system of each individual person. Sure, people's
immune systems vary, and a vaccine that worked on one might not
work on another, but that doesn't make it meaningless to talk about
the effectiveness of a vaccine.<br><br>The situation with art is messier, of course. You can't measure
effectiveness by simply taking a vote, as you do with vaccines.
You have to imagine the responses of subjects with a deep knowledge
of art, and enough clarity of mind to be able to ignore extraneous
influences like the fame of the artist. And even then you'd still
see some disagreement. People do vary, and judging art is hard,
especially recent art. There is definitely not a total order either
of works or of people's ability to judge them. But there is equally
definitely a partial order of both. So while it's not possible to
have perfect taste, it is possible to have good taste.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><font color="888888">

you that you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas
into words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually
wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over <!-- if you want --> to
get them exactly right. And your ideas won't just be imprecise, but
incomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones
you thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that's why I write
them.<br><br>Once you publish something, the convention is that whatever you
wrote was what you thought before you wrote it. These were your
ideas, and now you've expressed them. But you know this isn't true.
You know that putting your ideas into words changed them. And not
just the ideas you published. Presumably there were others that
turned out to be too broken to fix, and those you discarded instead.<br><br>It's not just having to commit your ideas to specific words that
makes writing so exacting. The real test is reading what you've
written. You have to pretend to be a neutral reader who knows nothing
of what's in your head, only what you wrote. When he reads what you
wrote, does it seem correct? Does it seem complete? If you make an
effort, you can read your writing as if you were a complete stranger,
and when you do the news is usually bad. It takes me many cycles
before I can get an essay past the stranger. But the stranger is
rational, so you always can, if you ask him what he needs. If he's
not satisfied because you failed to mention x or didn't qualify
some sentence sufficiently, then you mention x or add more
qualifications. Happy now? It may cost you some nice sentences, but
you have to resign yourself to that. You just have to make them as
good as you can and still satisfy the stranger.<br><br>This much, I assume, won't be that controversial. I think it will
accord with the experience of anyone who has tried to write about
anything nontrivial. There may exist people whose thoughts are so
perfectly formed that they just flow straight into words. But I've
never known anyone who could do this, and if I met someone who said
they could, it would seem evidence of their limitations rather than
their ability. Indeed, this is a trope in movies: the guy who claims
to have a plan for doing some difficult thing, and who when questioned
further, taps his head and says "It's all up here." Everyone watching
the movie knows what that means. At best the plan is vague and
incomplete. Very likely there's some undiscovered flaw that invalidates
it completely. At best it's a plan for a plan.<br><br>In precisely defined domains it's possible to form complete ideas
in your head. People can play chess in their heads, for example.
And mathematicians can do some amount of math in their heads, though
they don't seem to feel sure of a proof over a certain length till
they write it down. But this only seems possible with ideas you can
express in a formal language.  <font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font> Arguably what such people are
doing is putting ideas into words in their heads. I can to some
extent write essays in my head. I'll sometimes think of a paragraph
while walking or lying in bed that survives nearly unchanged in the
final version. But really I'm writing when I do this. I'm doing the
mental part of writing; my fingers just aren't moving as I do it.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>You can know a great deal about something without writing about it.
Can you ever know so much that you wouldn't learn more from trying
to explain what you know? I don't think so. I've written about at
least two subjects I know well — Lisp hacking and startups
— and in both cases I learned a lot from writing about them.
In both cases there were things I didn't consciously realize till
I had to explain them. And I don't think my experience was anomalous.
A great deal of knowledge is unconscious, and experts have if
anything a higher proportion of unconscious knowledge than beginners.<br><br>I'm not saying that writing is the best way to explore all ideas.
If you have ideas about architecture, presumably the best way to
explore them is to build actual buildings. What I'm saying is that
however much you learn from exploring ideas in other ways, you'll
still learn new things from writing about them.<br><br>Putting ideas into words doesn't have to mean writing, of course.
You can also do it the old way, by talking. But in my experience,
writing is the stricter test. You have to commit to a single, optimal
sequence of words. Less can go unsaid when you don't have tone of
voice to carry meaning. And you can focus in a way that would seem
excessive in conversation. I'll often spend 2 weeks on an essay and
reread drafts 50 times. If you did that in conversation
it would seem evidence of some kind of
mental disorder. 
If you're lazy,
of course, writing and talking are equally useless. But if you want
to push yourself to get things right, writing is the steeper hill.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The reason I've spent so long establishing this rather obvious point
is that it leads to another that many people will find shocking.
If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more
complete, then no one who hasn't written about a topic has fully
formed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fully
formed ideas about anything nontrivial.<br><br>It feels to them as if they do, especially if they're not in the
habit of critically examining their own thinking. Ideas can feel
complete. It's only when you try to put them into words that you
discover they're not. So if you never subject your ideas to that
test, you'll not only never have fully formed ideas, but also never
realize it.<br><br>Putting ideas into words is certainly no guarantee that they'll be
right. Far from it. But though it's not a sufficient condition, it
is a necessary one.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] Machinery and
circuits are formal languages.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>] I thought of this
sentence as I was walking down the street in Palo Alto.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>] There are two
senses of talking to someone: a strict sense in which the conversation
is verbal, and a more general sense in which it can take any form,
including writing. In the limit case (e.g. Seneca's letters),
conversation in the latter sense becomes essay writing.<br><br>It can be very useful to talk (in either sense) with other people
as you're writing something. But a verbal conversation will never
be more exacting than when you're talking about something you're
writing.<br><br><br><br><font color="888888"> <b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick

the rebirth of the concept of heresy.<br><br>In his excellent biography of Newton, Richard Westfall writes about the
moment when he was elected a fellow of Trinity College:
<blockquote>
  Supported comfortably, Newton was free to devote himself wholly
  to whatever he chose. To remain on, he had only to avoid the three
  unforgivable sins: crime, heresy, and marriage.
  <font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font>
</blockquote>
The first time I read that, in the 1990s, it sounded amusingly
medieval. How strange, to have to avoid committing heresy. But when
I reread it 20 years later it sounded like a description of
contemporary employment.<br><br>There are an ever-increasing number of opinions you can be fired
for. Those doing the firing don't use the word "heresy" to describe
them, but structurally they're equivalent. Structurally there are
two distinctive things about heresy: (1) that it takes priority
over the question of truth or falsity, and (2) that it outweighs
everything else the speaker has done.<br><br>For example, when someone calls a statement "x-ist," they're also
implicitly saying that this is the end of the discussion. They do
not, having said this, go on to consider whether the statement is
true or not. Using such labels is the conversational equivalent of
signalling an exception. That's one of the reasons they're used:
to end a discussion.<br><br>If you find yourself talking to someone who uses these labels a
lot, it might be worthwhile to ask them explicitly if they believe
any babies are being thrown out with the bathwater. Can a statement
be x-ist, for whatever value of x, and also true? If the answer is
yes, then they're admitting to banning the truth. That's obvious
enough that I'd guess most would answer no. But if they answer no,
it's easy to show that they're mistaken, and that in practice such
labels are applied to statements regardless of their truth or
falsity.<br><br>The clearest evidence of this is that whether a statement is
considered x-ist often depends on who said it. Truth doesn't work
that way. The same statement can't be true when one person says it,
but x-ist, and therefore false, when another person does.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The other distinctive thing about heresies, compared to ordinary
opinions, is that the public expression of them outweighs everything
else the speaker has done. In ordinary matters, like knowledge of
history, or taste in music, you're judged by the average of your
opinions. A heresy is qualitatively different. It's like dropping
a chunk of uranium onto the scale.<br><br>Back in the day (and still, in some places) the punishment for
heresy was death. You could have led a life of exemplary goodness,
but if you publicly doubted, say, the divinity of Christ, you were
going to burn. Nowadays, in civilized countries, heretics only get
fired in the metaphorical sense, by losing their jobs. But the
structure of the situation is the same: the heresy
outweighs everything else. You could have spent the last ten years
saving children's lives, but if you express certain opinions, you're
automatically fired.<br><br>It's much the same as if you committed a crime. No matter how
virtuously you've lived, if you commit a crime, you must still
suffer the penalty of the law. Having lived a previously blameless
life might mitigate the punishment, but it doesn't affect whether
you're guilty or not.<br><br>A heresy is an opinion whose expression is treated like a crime —
one that makes some people feel not merely that you're mistaken,
but that you should be punished. Indeed, their desire to see you
punished is often stronger than it would be if you'd committed an
actual crime. There are many on the far left who believe
strongly in the reintegration of felons (as I do myself), and yet
seem to feel that anyone guilty of certain heresies should never
work again.<br><br>There are always some heresies — some opinions you'd be punished
for expressing. But there are a lot more now than there were a few
decades ago, and even those who are happy about this would have to
agree that it's so.<br><br>Why? Why has this antiquated-sounding religious concept come back
in a secular form? And why now?<br><br>You need two ingredients for a wave of intolerance: intolerant
people, and an ideology to guide them. The intolerant people are
always there. They exist in every sufficiently large society. That's
why waves of intolerance can arise so suddenly; all they need is
something to set them off.<br><br>I've already written an <a href="conformism.html"><u>essay</u></a> 
describing the aggressively
conventional-minded. The short version is that people can be
classified in two dimensions according to (1) how independent- or
conventional-minded they are, and (2) how aggressive they are about
it. The aggressively conventional-minded are the enforcers of
orthodoxy.<br><br>Normally they're only locally visible. They're the grumpy, censorious
people in a group — the ones who are always first to complain when
something violates the current rules of propriety. But occasionally,
like a vector field whose elements become aligned, a large number
of aggressively conventional-minded people unite behind some ideology
all at once. Then they become much more of a problem, because a mob
dynamic takes over, where the enthusiasm of each participant is
increased by the enthusiasm of the others.<br><br>The most notorious 20th century case may have been the Cultural
Revolution. Though initiated by Mao to undermine his rivals, the
Cultural Revolution was otherwise mostly a grass-roots phenomenon.
Mao said in essence: There are heretics among us. Seek them out and
punish them. And that's all the aggressively conventional-minded
ever need to hear. They went at it with the delight of dogs chasing
squirrels.<br><br>To unite the conventional-minded, an ideology must have many of the
features of a religion. In particular it must have strict and
arbitrary rules that adherents can demonstrate their 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaHLd8de6nM"><u>purity</u></a> 
by obeying, and its adherents must believe that anyone who obeys these
rules is ipso facto morally superior to anyone who doesn't.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>In the late 1980s a new ideology of this type appeared in US
universities. It had a very strong component of moral purity, and
the aggressively conventional-minded seized upon it with their usual
eagerness — all the more because the relaxation of social norms
in the preceding decades meant there had been less and less to
forbid. The resulting wave of intolerance has been eerily similar
in form to the Cultural Revolution, though fortunately much smaller
in magnitude.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>I've deliberately avoided mentioning any specific heresies here.
Partly because one of the universal tactics of heretic hunters, now
as in the past, is to accuse those who disapprove of the way in
which they suppress ideas of being heretics themselves. Indeed,
this tactic is so consistent that you could use it as a way of
detecting witch hunts in any era.<br><br>And that's the second reason I've avoided mentioning any specific
heresies. I want this essay to work in the future, not just now.
And unfortunately it probably will. The aggressively conventional-minded
will always be among us, looking for things to forbid. All they
need is an ideology to tell them what. And it's unlikely the current
one will be the last.<br><br>There are aggressively conventional-minded people on both the right
and the left. The reason the current wave of intolerance comes from
the left is simply because the new unifying ideology happened to
come from the left. The next one might come from the right. Imagine
what that would be like.<br><br>Fortunately in western countries the suppression of heresies is
nothing like as bad as it used to be. Though the window of opinions
you can express publicly has narrowed in the last decade, it's still
much wider than it was a few hundred years ago. The problem is the
derivative. Up till about 1985 the window had been growing ever
wider. Anyone looking into the future in 1985 would have expected
freedom of expression to continue to increase. Instead it has
decreased.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#dddddd">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>The situation is similar to what's happened with infectious diseases
like measles. Anyone looking into the future in 2010 would have
expected the number of measles cases in the US to continue to
decrease. Instead, thanks to anti-vaxxers, it has increased. The
absolute number is still not that high. The problem is the derivative.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#dddddd">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>In both cases it's hard to know how much to worry. Is it really
dangerous to society as a whole if a handful of extremists refuse
to get their kids vaccinated, or shout down speakers at universities?
The point to start worrying is presumably when their efforts start
to spill over into everyone else's lives. And in both cases that
does seem to be happening.<br><br>So it's probably worth spending some amount of effort on pushing
back to keep open the window of free expression. My hope is that
this essay will help form social antibodies not just against current
efforts to suppress ideas, but against the concept of heresy in
general. That's the real prize. How do you disable the concept of
heresy? Since the Enlightenment, western societies have discovered
many techniques for doing that, but there are surely more to be
discovered.<br><br>Overall I'm optimistic. Though the trend in freedom of expression
has been bad over the last decade, it's been good over the longer
term. And there are signs that the current wave of intolerance is
peaking. Independent-minded people I talk to seem more confident
than they did a few years ago. On the other side, even some of the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/opinion/cancel-culture-free-speech-poll.html"><u>leaders</u></a> are starting to wonder if things have 
gone too far. And popular culture among the young has already moved on. 
All we have
to do is keep pushing back, and the wave collapses. And then we'll
be net ahead, because as well as having defeated this wave, we'll
also have developed new tactics for resisting the next one.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] 
Or more accurately, biographies of Newton, since Westfall wrote
two: a long version called <i>Never at Rest</i>, and a shorter one called
<i>The Life of Isaac Newton</i>. Both are great. The short version moves
faster, but the long one is full of interesting and often very funny
details. This passage is the same in both.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Another more subtle but equally damning bit of evidence is
that claims of x-ism are never qualified. You never hear anyone say
that a statement is "probably x-ist" or "almost certainly y-ist."
If claims of x-ism were actually claims about truth, you'd expect
to see "probably" in front of "x-ist" as often as you see it in
front of "fallacious."<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>] 
The rules must be strict, but they need not be demanding. So
the most effective type of rules are those about superficial matters,
like doctrinal minutiae, or the precise words adherents must use.
Such rules can be made extremely complicated, and yet don't repel
potential converts by requiring significant sacrifice.<br><br>The superficial demands of orthodoxy make it an inexpensive substitute
for virtue. And that in turn is one of the reasons orthodoxy is so
attractive to bad people. You could be a horrible person, and yet
as long as you're orthodox, you're better than everyone who isn't.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>] 
Arguably there were two. The first had died down somewhat by
2000, but was followed by a second in the 2010s, probably caused
by social media.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>] 
Fortunately most of those trying to suppress ideas today still
respect Enlightenment principles enough to pay lip service to them.
They know they're not supposed to ban ideas per se, so they have
to recast the ideas as causing "harm," which sounds like something
that can be banned. The more extreme try to claim speech itself is
violence, or even that silence is. But strange as it may sound,
such gymnastics are a good sign. We'll know we're really in trouble
when they stop bothering to invent pretenses for banning ideas —
when, like the medieval church, they say "Damn right we're banning
ideas, and in fact here's a list of them."<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>] 
People only have the luxury of ignoring the medical consensus
about vaccines because vaccines have worked so well. If we didn't
have any vaccines at all, the mortality rate would be so high that
most current anti-vaxxers would be begging for them. And the situation
with freedom of expression is similar. It's only because they live
in a world created by the Enlightenment that kids from the suburbs
can play at banning ideas.<br><br><br><br><font color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Marc Andreessen, Chris Best,

could give for getting in, per word, was 
<blockquote>
  Explain what you've learned from users.
</blockquote>
That tests a lot of things: whether you're paying attention to
users, how well you understand them, and even how much they need
what you're making.<br><br>Afterward I asked myself the same question. What have I learned
from YC's users, the startups we've funded?<br><br>The first thing that came to mind was that most startups have the
same problems. No two have exactly the same problems, but it's
surprising how much the problems remain the same, regardless of
what they're making. Once you've advised 100 startups all doing
different things, you rarely encounter problems you haven't seen
before.<br><br>This fact is one of the things that makes YC work. But I didn't
know it when we started YC. I only had a few data points: our own
startup, and those started by friends. It was a surprise to me how
often the same problems recur in different forms. Many later stage
investors might never realize this, because later stage investors
might not advise 100 startups in their whole career, but a YC partner
will get this much experience in the first year or two.<br><br>That's one advantage of funding large numbers of early stage companies
rather than smaller numbers of later-stage ones. You get a lot of
data. Not just because you're looking at more companies, but also
because more goes wrong.<br><br>But knowing (nearly) all the problems startups can encounter doesn't
mean that advising them can be automated, or reduced to a formula.
There's no substitute for individual office hours with a YC partner.
Each startup is unique, which means they have to be advised
by specific partners who know them well.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>We learned that the hard way, in the notorious "batch that broke
YC" in the summer of 2012. Up till that point we treated the partners
as a pool. When a startup requested office hours, they got the next
available slot posted by any partner. That meant every partner had
to know every startup. This worked fine up to 60 startups, but when
the batch grew to 80, everything broke. The founders probably didn't
realize anything was wrong, but the partners were confused and
unhappy because halfway through the batch they still didn't know
all the companies yet.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>At first I was puzzled. How could things be fine at 60 startups and
broken at 80? It was only a third more. Then I realized what had
happened. We were using an <i>O(n<sup><small>2</small></sup>)</i> algorithm. So of course it blew
up.<br><br>The solution we adopted was the classic one in these situations.
We sharded the batch into smaller groups of startups, each overseen
by a dedicated group of partners. That fixed the problem, and has
worked fine ever since. But the batch that broke YC was a powerful
demonstration of how individualized the process of advising startups
has to be.<br><br>Another related surprise is how bad founders can be at realizing
what their problems are. Founders will sometimes come in to talk
about some problem, and we'll discover another much bigger one in
the course of the conversation. For example (and this case is all
too common), founders will come in to talk about the difficulties
they're having raising money, and after digging into their situation,
it turns out the reason is that the company is doing badly, and
investors can tell. Or founders will come in worried that they still
haven't cracked the problem of user acquisition, and the reason turns out
to be that their product isn't good enough. There have been times
when I've asked "Would you use this yourself, if you hadn't built
it?" and the founders, on thinking about it, said "No." Well, there's
the reason you're having trouble getting users.<br><br>Often founders know what their problems are, but not their relative
importance.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font>
They'll come in to talk about three problems
they're worrying about. One is of moderate importance, one doesn't
matter at all, and one will kill the company if it isn't addressed
immediately. It's like watching one of those horror movies where
the heroine is deeply upset that her boyfriend cheated on her, and
only mildly curious about the door that's mysteriously ajar. You
want to say: never mind about your boyfriend, think about that door!
Fortunately in office hours you can. So while startups still die
with some regularity, it's rarely because they wandered into a room
containing a murderer. The YC partners can warn them where the
murderers are.<br><br>Not that founders listen. That was another big surprise: how often
founders don't listen to us. A couple weeks ago I talked to a partner
who had been working for YC for a couple batches and was starting
to see the pattern. "They come back a year later," she said, "and
say 'We wish we'd listened to you.'"<br><br>It took me a long time to figure out why founders don't listen. At
first I thought it was mere stubbornness. That's part of the reason,
but another and probably more important reason is that so much about
startups is <a href="before.html">counterintuitive</a>. 
And when you tell someone something
counterintuitive, what it sounds to them is wrong. So the reason
founders don't listen to us is that they don't <i>believe</i> us. At
least not till experience teaches them otherwise.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>The reason startups are so counterintuitive is that they're so
different from most people's other experiences. No one knows what
it's like except those who've done it. Which is why YC partners
should usually have been founders themselves. But strangely enough,
the counterintuitiveness of startups turns out to be another of the
things that make YC work. If it weren't counterintuitive, founders
wouldn't need our advice about how to do it.<br><br>Focus is doubly important for early stage startups, because not
only do they have a hundred different problems, they don't have
anyone to work on them except the founders. If the founders focus
on things that don't matter, there's no one focusing on the things
that do. So the essence of what happens at YC is to figure out which
problems matter most, then cook up ideas for solving them — ideally
at a resolution of a week or less — and then try those ideas and
measure how well they worked. The focus is on action, with measurable,
near-term results.<br><br>This doesn't imply that founders should rush forward regardless of
the consequences. If you correct course at a high enough frequency,
you can be simultaneously decisive at a micro scale and tentative
at a macro scale. The result is a somewhat winding path, but executed
very rapidly, like the path a running back takes downfield. And in
practice there's less backtracking than you might expect. Founders
usually guess right about which direction to run in, especially if
they have someone experienced like a YC partner to bounce their
hypotheses off. And when they guess wrong, they notice fast, because
they'll talk about the results at office hours the next week.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#dddddd">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>A small improvement in navigational ability can make you a lot
faster, because it has a double effect: the path is shorter, and
you can travel faster along it when you're more certain it's the
right one. That's where a lot of YC's value lies, in helping founders
get an extra increment of focus that lets them move faster. And
since moving fast is the essence of a startup, YC in effect makes
startups more startup-like.<br><br>Speed defines startups. Focus enables speed. YC improves focus.<br><br>Why are founders uncertain about what to do? Partly because startups
almost by definition are doing something new, which means no one
knows how to do it yet, or in most cases even what "it" is. Partly
because startups are so counterintuitive generally. And partly
because many founders, especially young and ambitious ones, have
been trained to win the wrong way. That took me years to figure
out. The educational system in most countries trains you to win by
<a href="lesson.html">hacking the test</a> 
instead of actually doing whatever it's supposed
to measure. But that stops working when you start a startup. So
part of what YC does is to retrain founders to stop trying to hack
the test. (It takes a surprisingly long time. A year in, you still
see them reverting to their old habits.)<br><br>YC is not simply more experienced founders passing on their knowledge.
It's more like specialization than apprenticeship. The knowledge
of the YC partners and the founders have different shapes: It
wouldn't be worthwhile for a founder to acquire the encyclopedic
knowledge of startup problems that a YC partner has, just as it
wouldn't be worthwhile for a YC partner to acquire the depth of
domain knowledge that a founder has. That's why it can still be
valuable for an experienced founder to do YC, just as it can still
be valuable for an experienced athlete to have a coach.<br><br>The other big thing YC gives founders is colleagues, and this may
be even more important than the advice of partners. If you look at
history, great work clusters around certain places and institutions:
Florence in the late 15th century, the University of G�ttingen in
the late 19th, <i>The New Yorker</i> under Ross, Bell Labs, Xerox PARC.
However good you are, good colleagues make you better. Indeed, very
ambitious people probably need colleagues more than anyone else,
because they're so starved for them in everyday life.<br><br>Whether or not YC manages one day to be listed alongside those
famous clusters, it won't be for lack of trying. We were very aware
of this historical phenomenon and deliberately designed YC to be
one. By this point it's not bragging to say that it's the biggest
cluster of great startup founders. Even people trying to attack YC
concede that.<br><br>Colleagues and startup founders are two of the most powerful forces
in the world, so you'd expect it to have a big effect to combine
them. Before YC, to the extent people thought about the question
at all, most assumed they couldn't be combined — that loneliness
was the price of independence. That was how it felt to us when we
started our own startup in Boston in the 1990s. We had a handful
of older people we could go to for advice (of varying quality), but
no peers. There was no one we could commiserate with about the
misbehavior of investors, or speculate with about the future of
technology. I often tell founders to make something they themselves
want, and YC is certainly that: it was designed to be exactly what
we wanted when we were starting a startup.<br><br>One thing we wanted was to be able to get seed funding without
having to make the rounds of random rich people. That has become a
commodity now, at least in the US. But great colleagues can never
become a commodity, because the fact that they cluster in some
places means they're proportionally absent from the rest.<br><br>Something magical happens where they do cluster though. The energy
in the room at a YC dinner is like nothing else I've experienced.
We would have been happy just to have one or two other startups to
talk to. When you have a whole roomful it's another thing entirely.<br><br>YC founders aren't just inspired by one another. They also help one
another. That's the happiest thing I've learned about startup
founders: how generous they can be in helping one another. We noticed
this in the first batch and consciously designed YC to magnify it.
The result is something far more intense than, say, a university.
Between the partners, the alumni, and their batchmates, founders
are surrounded by people who want to help them, and can.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] 
This is why I've never liked it when people refer to YC as a
"bootcamp." It's intense like a bootcamp, but the opposite in
structure. Instead of everyone doing the same thing, they're each
talking to YC partners to figure out what their specific startup
needs.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>] 
When I say the summer 2012 batch was broken, I mean it felt
to the partners that something was wrong. Things weren't yet so
broken that the startups had a worse experience. In fact that batch
did unusually well.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>] 
This situation reminds me of the research showing that people
are much better at answering questions than they are at judging how
accurate their answers are. The two phenomena feel very similar.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>] 
The <a href="airbnbs.html">Airbnbs</a> were 
particularly good at listening — partly
because they were flexible and disciplined, but also because they'd
had such a rough time during the preceding year. They were ready
to listen.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>] 
The optimal unit of decisiveness depends on how long it takes
to get results, and that depends on the type of problem you're
solving. When you're negotiating with investors, it could be a
couple days, whereas if you're building hardware it could be months.<br><br><br><br>

share certain truths in common with us. The truths of mathematics
would be the same, because they're true by definition. Ditto for
the truths of physics; the mass of a carbon atom would be the same
on their planet. But I think we'd share other truths with aliens
besides the truths of math and physics, and that it would be
worthwhile to think about what these might be.<br><br>For example, I think we'd share the principle that a controlled
experiment testing some hypothesis entitles us to have proportionally
increased belief in it. It seems fairly likely, too, that it would
be true for aliens that one can get better at something by practicing.
We'd probably share Occam's razor. There doesn't seem anything
specifically human about any of these ideas.<br><br>We can only guess, of course. We can't say for sure what forms
intelligent life might take. Nor is it my goal here to explore that
question, interesting though it is. The point of the idea of alien
truth is not that it gives us a way to speculate about what forms
intelligent life might take, but that it gives us a threshold, or
more precisely a target, for truth. If you're trying to find the
most general truths short of those of math or physics, then presumably
they'll be those we'd share in common with other forms of intelligent
life.<br><br>Alien truth will work best as a heuristic if we err on the side of
generosity. If an idea might plausibly be relevant to aliens, that's
enough. Justice, for example. I wouldn't want to bet that all
intelligent beings would understand the concept of justice, but I
wouldn't want to bet against it either.<br><br>The idea of alien truth is related to Erdos's idea of God's book.
He used to describe a particularly good proof as being in God's
book, the implication being (a) that a sufficiently good proof was
more discovered than invented, and (b) that its goodness would be
universally recognized. If there's such a thing as alien truth,
then there's more in God's book than math.<br><br>What should we call the search for alien truth? The obvious choice
is "philosophy." Whatever else philosophy includes, it should
probably include this. I'm fairly sure Aristotle would have thought
so. One could even make the case that the search for alien truth
is, if not an accurate description <i>of</i> philosophy, a good
definition <i>for</i> it. I.e. that it's what people who call
themselves philosophers should be doing, whether or not they currently
are. But I'm not wedded to that; doing it is what matters, not what
we call it.<br><br>We may one day have something like alien life among us in the form
of AIs. And that may in turn allow us to be precise about what
truths an intelligent being would have to share with us. We might
find, for example, that it's impossible to create something we'd
consider intelligent that doesn't use Occam's razor. We might one
day even be able to prove that. But though this sort of research
would be very interesting, it's not necessary for our purposes, or
even the same field; the goal of philosophy, if we're going to call it that, would be
to see what ideas we come up with using alien truth as a target,
not to say precisely where the threshold of it is. Those two questions might one
day converge, but they'll converge from quite different directions,
and till they do, it would be too constraining to restrict ourselves
to thinking only about things we're certain would be alien truths.
Especially since this will probably be one of those areas where the
best guesses turn out to be surprisingly close to optimal. (Let's
see if that one does.)<br><br>Whatever we call it, the attempt to discover alien truths would be
a worthwhile undertaking. And curiously enough, that is itself
probably an alien truth.<br><br><br><br><br><br><font color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Greg Brockman,

between being made of matter that behaves in a predictable way, and
the feeling that I could choose to do whatever I wanted. At the
time I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question. At
that age (like most succeeding ages) I was always in trouble with
the authorities, and it seemed to me that there might possibly be
some way to get out of trouble by arguing that I wasn't responsible
for my actions. I gradually lost hope of that, but the puzzle
remained: How do you reconcile being a machine made of matter with
the feeling that you're free to choose what you do?
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The best way to explain the answer may be to start with a slightly
wrong version, and then fix it. The wrong version is: You can do
what you want, but you can't want what you want. Yes, you can control
what you do, but you'll do what you want, and you can't control
that.<br><br>The reason this is mistaken is that people do sometimes change what
they want. People who don't want to want something — drug addicts,
for example — can sometimes make themselves stop wanting it. And
people who want to want something — who want to like classical
music, or broccoli — sometimes succeed.<br><br>So we modify our initial statement: You can do what you want, but
you can't want to want what you want.<br><br>That's still not quite true. It's possible to change what you want
to want. I can imagine someone saying "I decided to stop wanting
to like classical music." But we're getting closer to the truth.
It's rare for people to change what they want to want, and the more
"want to"s we add, the rarer it gets.<br><br>We can get arbitrarily close to a true statement by adding more "want
to"s in much the same way we can get arbitrarily close to 1 by adding
more 9s to a string of 9s following a decimal point. In practice
three or four "want to"s must surely be enough. It's hard even to
envision what it would mean to change what you want to want to want
to want, let alone actually do it.<br><br>So one way to express the correct answer is to use a regular
expression. You can do what you want, but there's some statement
of the form "you can't (want to)* want what you want" that's true.
Ultimately you get back to a want that you don't control.

I didn't know when I was 9 that matter might behave randomly,
but I don't think it affects the problem much. Randomness destroys
the ghost in the machine as effectively as determinism.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
If you don't like using an expression, you can make the same
point using higher-order desires: There is some n such that you
don't control your nth-order desires.<br><br><br><br>

been replaced by some more efficient way of acquiring knowledge.
Mysterious "tapes" would load it into one's brain like a program
being loaded into a computer.<br><br>That sort of thing is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Not just
because it would be hard to build a replacement for reading, but
because even if one existed, it would be insufficient. Reading about
x doesn't just teach you about x; it also teaches you how to write.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Would that matter? If we replaced reading, would anyone need to be
good at writing?<br><br>The reason it would matter is that writing is not just a way to
convey ideas, but also a way to have them.<br><br>A good writer doesn't just think, and then write down what he
thought, as a sort of transcript. A good writer will almost always
discover new things in the process of writing. And there is, as far
as I know, no substitute for this kind of discovery. Talking about
your ideas with other people is a good way to develop them. But
even after doing this, you'll find you still discover new things
when you sit down to write. There is a kind of thinking that can
only be done by <a href="words.html"><u>writing</u></a>.<br><br>There are of course kinds of thinking that can be done without
writing. If you don't need to go too deeply into a problem, you can
solve it without writing. If you're thinking about how two pieces
of machinery should fit together, writing about it probably won't
help much. And when a problem can be described formally, you can
sometimes solve it in your head. But if you need to solve a
complicated, ill-defined problem, it will almost always help to
write about it. Which in turn means that someone who's not good at
writing will almost always be at a disadvantage in solving such
problems.<br><br>You can't think well without writing well, and you can't write well
without reading well. And I mean that last "well" in both senses.
You have to be good at reading, and read good things.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>People who just want information may find other ways to get it.
But people who want to have ideas can't afford to.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Audiobooks can give you examples of good writing, but having
them read to you doesn't teach you as much about writing as reading
them yourself.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
By "good at reading" I don't mean good at the mechanics of
reading. You don't have to be good at extracting words from the
page so much as extracting meaning from the words.<br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://practical-scheme.net/trans/read-j.html">Japanese Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://catcoding.me/p/read/">Chinese Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="5" width="1" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://marcotrombetti.com/leggere">Italian Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="8" border="0"></div><div><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/how-to-get-new-ideas-5.gif" width="12" height="14" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><font size="2" face="verdana"><a href="https://dorianmarie.fr/paulgraham/lire.html">French Translation</a><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="2" width="1" border="0"><br></font></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="3" width="1" border="0"></div><div></div><div></div><br><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

of different fields, what would the intersection look like? I decided
to find out by making it.<br><br>Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone
working in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of the
intersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it does
have a definite shape; it's not just a point labelled "work hard."<br><br>The following recipe assumes you're very ambitious.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose
needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a
natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that
offers scope to do great work.<br><br>In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion.
Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it.
So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for
and great interest in.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult. When
you're young you don't know what you're good at or what different
kinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not
even exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at
14, most have to figure it out.<br><br>The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not
sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going.
You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine. It's
good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries
come from noticing connections between different fields.<br><br>Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let "work"
mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do
great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own.
It may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your
part of it.<br><br>What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly
ambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves,
exciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly
ambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach
yourself calculus, till at 21 you're starting to explore unanswered
questions in physics. But always preserve excitingness.<br><br>There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the
rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let
it have its way, will also show you what to work on.<br><br>What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that
would bore most other people? That's what you're looking for.<br><br>Once you've found something you're excessively interested in, the
next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the
frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a
distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get
close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.<br><br>The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because
your brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler
model of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions
about things that everyone else took for granted. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often
has a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math.
It would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears,
embrace it.<br><br>Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren't interested
in them — in fact, especially if they aren't. If you're excited
about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have
enough expertise to say precisely what they're all overlooking,
that's as good a bet as you'll find.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier,
notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone
who's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.<br><br>Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible
to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the
empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality.
That's why it's essential to work on something you're deeply
interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere
diligence ever could.<br><br>The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the
desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and
that combination is the most powerful of all.<br><br>The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack
in the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there's a whole world
inside.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Let's talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring
out what to work on. The main reason it's hard is that you can't
tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which
means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for
years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at
it. And in the meantime you're not doing, and thus not learning
about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose
late based on very incomplete information.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in
two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that
grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the
more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what
to do.<br><br>The educational systems in most countries pretend it's easy. They
expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what
it's really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal
trajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.<br><br>It would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted
that the system not only can't do much to help you figure out what
to work on, but is designed on the assumption that you'll somehow
magically guess as a teenager. They don't tell you, but I will:
when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you're on your own.
Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will
find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on
the assumption that everyone does.<br><br>What should you do if you're young and ambitious but don't know
what to work on? What you should <i>not</i> do is drift along passively,
assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action.
But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read
biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how
much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result
of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up.
So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to
do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people,
read lots of books, ask lots of questions.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#dddddd">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you
learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very
different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need
to give different types of work a chance to show you what they're
like. But a field should become <i>increasingly</i> interesting as you
learn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you.<br><br>Don't worry if you find you're interested in different things than
other people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the
better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste
for work means you'll be productive. And you're more likely to find
new things if you're looking where few have looked before.<br><br>One sign that you're suited for some kind of work is when you like
even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.<br><br>But fields aren't people; you don't owe them any loyalty. If in the
course of working on one thing you discover another that's more
exciting, don't be afraid to switch.<br><br>If you're making something for people, make sure it's something
they actually want. The best way to do this is to make something
you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool
you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests,
this will also get you your initial audience.<br><br>This <i>should</i> follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most
exciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason
I mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong.
Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some
imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down
that route, you're lost.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#dddddd">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you're
trying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion,
fear, money, politics, other people's wishes, eminent frauds. But
if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof
against all of them. If you're interested, you're not astray.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy,
but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of
obstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it
does take a good deal of boldness.<br><br>But while you need boldness, you don't usually need much planning.
In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard
on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of
it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try
to preserve certain invariants.<br><br>The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements
you can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich
by deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal,
but you can't discover natural selection that way.<br><br>I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy
is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most
interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call
this approach "staying upwind." This is how most people who've done
great work seem to have done it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Even when you've found something exciting to work on, working on
it is not always straightforward. There will be times when some new
idea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight to
work. But there will also be plenty of times when things aren't
like that.<br><br>You don't just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration.
There are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there's a
technique to working, just as there is to sailing.<br><br>For example, while you must work hard, it's possible to work too
hard, and if you do that you'll find you get diminishing returns:
fatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health.
The point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the
type. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for
four or five hours a day.<br><br>Ideally those hours will be contiguous. To the extent you can, try
to arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in.
You'll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be interrupted.<br><br>It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working.
You'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial
threshold. Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a
flaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both
per day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in the
sense that it's higher than the energy required to keep going, it's
ok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over
it.<br><br>It's usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great
work, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn't. When I'm
reluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself by
saying "I'll just read over what I've got so far." Five minutes
later I've found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and
I'm off.<br><br>Similar techniques work for starting new projects. It's ok to lie
to yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example.
Lots of great things began with someone saying "How hard could it
be?"<br><br>This is one case where the young have an advantage. They're more
optimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimism
is ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.<br><br>Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be
more work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise
in tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best
work happens in what was meant to be the final stage.<br><br>Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what
you're working on, at least in your own mind. If that helps you
discover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie after
all.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#dddddd">7</font></a>]</font><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Since there are two senses of starting work — per day and per
project — there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project
procrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off starting
that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn't
quite right. When you're procrastinating in units of years, you can
get a lot not done.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#dddddd">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it
usually camouflages itself as work. You're not just sitting around
doing nothing; you're working industriously on something else. So
per-project procrastination doesn't set off the alarms that per-day
procrastination does. You're too busy to notice it.<br><br>The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I
working on what I most want to work on? When you're young it's ok
if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous
as you get older.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#dddddd">9</font></a>]</font><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people
an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can't think of
this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the
work sufficiently engaging as it's happening.<br><br>There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years
at things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not
how great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently
on something you're genuinely interested in. When you pause to take
stock, you're surprised how far you've come.<br><br>The reason we're surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative
effect of work. Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but
if you do it every day you'll write a book a year. That's the key:
consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every
day. They get something done, rather than nothing.<br><br>If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most
people who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to
think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon:
the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more.
Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more
new fans they'll bring you.<br><br>The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat
in the beginning. It isn't; it's still a wonderful exponential
curve. But we can't grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential
growth in its early stages.<br><br>Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it's
worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since
we underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done
unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase
of learning something new because they know from experience that
learning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their
audience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do.
If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential
growth, many more would do it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Work doesn't just happen when you're trying to. There's a kind of
undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying
in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a
little, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by
frontal attack.<br><br>You have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this
phenomenon, though. You can't just walk around daydreaming. The
daydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate work that feeds
it questions.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#dddddd">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>Everyone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it's also important
to avoid them in the other half of the cycle. When you let your
mind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at that
moment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out
of the top spot, or you'll waste this valuable type of thinking on
the distraction instead. (Exception: Don't avoid love.)<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field.
Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't
know what you're aiming for.<br><br>And that <i>is</i> what you're aiming for, because if you don't try to
be the best, you won't even be good. This observation has been made
by so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth
thinking about why it's true. It could be because ambition is a
phenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction — where
almost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short.
Or it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively
different thing from ambition to be good. Or maybe being good is
simply too vague a standard. Probably all three are true.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#dddddd">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>Fortunately there's a kind of economy of scale here. Though it might
seem like you'd be taking on a heavy burden by trying to be the
best, in practice you often end up net ahead. It's exciting, and
also strangely liberating. It simplifies things. In some ways it's
easier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good.<br><br>One way to aim high is to try to make something that people will
care about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions matter
more than your contemporaries', but because something that still
seems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Don't try to work in a distinctive style. Just try to do the best
job you can; you won't be able to help doing it in a distinctive
way.<br><br>Style is doing things in a distinctive way without trying to. Trying
to is affectation.<br><br>Affectation is in effect to pretend that someone other than you is
doing the work. You adopt an impressive but fake persona, and while
you're pleased with the impressiveness, the fakeness is what shows
in the work.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#dddddd">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>The temptation to be someone else is greatest for the young. They
often feel like nobodies. But you never need to worry about that
problem, because it's self-solving if you work on sufficiently
ambitious projects. If you succeed at an ambitious project, you're
not a nobody; you're the person who did it. So just do the work and
your identity will take care of itself.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
"Avoid affectation" is a useful rule so far as it goes, but how
would you express this idea positively? How would you say what to
be, instead of what not to be? The best answer is earnest. If you're
earnest you avoid not just affectation but a whole set of similar
vices.<br><br>The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We're
taught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue — as a kind
of sacrifice. But in fact it's a source of power too. To see new
ideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You're
trying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how can
you have a sharp eye for the truth if you're intellectually dishonest?<br><br>One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight
positive pressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willing
to admit that you're mistaken. Once you've admitted you were mistaken
about something, you're free. Till then you have to carry it.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#dddddd">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another more subtle component of earnestness is informality.
Informality is much more important than its grammatically negative
name implies. It's not merely the absence of something. It means
focusing on what matters instead of what doesn't.<br><br>What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as
doing the work, you're trying to seem a certain way as you're doing
it. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being
good. That's one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work:
they expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that's
basically the definition of a nerd.<br><br>Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that's exactly what you need
in doing great work. It's not learned; it's preserved from childhood.
So hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather than
the one who sits back and offers sophisticated-sounding criticisms
of them. "It's easy to criticize" is true in the most literal sense,
and the route to great work is never easy.<br><br>There may be some jobs where it's an advantage to be cynical and
pessimistic, but if you want to do great work it's an advantage to
be optimistic, even though that means you'll risk looking like a
fool sometimes. There's an old tradition of doing the opposite. The
Old Testament says it's better to keep quiet lest you look like a
fool. But that's advice for <i>seeming</i> smart. If you actually want
to discover new things, it's better to take the risk of telling
people your ideas.<br><br>Some people are naturally earnest, and with others it takes a
conscious effort. Either kind of earnestness will suffice. But I
doubt it would be possible to do great work without being earnest.
It's so hard to do even if you are. You don't have enough margin
for error to accommodate the distortions introduced by being affected,
intellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable, or cool.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#dddddd">14</font></a>]</font><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Great work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself.
It's usually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middle
of working on something, ask which choice is more consistent.<br><br>You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won't necessarily
have to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some
effort; when there's something you need to redo, status quo bias
and laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat
this ask: If I'd already made the change, would I want to revert
to what I have now?<br><br>Have the confidence to cut. Don't keep something that doesn't fit
just because you're proud of it, or because it cost you a lot of
effort.<br><br>Indeed, in some kinds of work it's good to strip whatever you're
doing to its essence. The result will be more concentrated; you'll
understand it better; and you won't be able to lie to yourself about
whether there's anything real there.<br><br>Mathematical elegance may sound like a mere metaphor, drawn from
the arts. That's what I thought when I first heard the term "elegant"
applied to a proof. But now I suspect it's conceptually prior — 
that the main ingredient in artistic elegance is mathematical
elegance. At any rate it's a useful standard well beyond math.<br><br>Elegance can be a long-term bet, though. Laborious solutions will
often have more prestige in the short term. They cost a lot of
effort and they're hard to understand, both of which impress people,
at least temporarily.<br><br>Whereas some of the very best work will seem like it took comparatively
little effort, because it was in a sense already there. It didn't
have to be built, just seen. It's a very good sign when it's hard
to say whether you're creating something or discovering it.<br><br>When you're doing work that could be seen as either creation or
discovery, err on the side of discovery. Try thinking of yourself
as a mere conduit through which the ideas take their natural shape.<br><br>(Strangely enough, one exception is the problem of choosing a problem
to work on. This is usually seen as search, but in the best case
it's more like creating something. In the best case you create the
field in the process of exploring it.)<br><br>Similarly, if you're trying to build a powerful tool, make it
gratuitously unrestrictive. A powerful tool almost by definition
will be used in ways you didn't expect, so err on the side of
eliminating restrictions, even if you don't know what the benefit
will be.<br><br>Great work will often be tool-like in the sense of being something
others build on. So it's a good sign if you're creating ideas that
others could use, or exposing questions that others could answer.
The best ideas have implications in many different areas.<br><br>If you express your ideas in the most general form, they'll be truer
than you intended.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
True by itself is not enough, of course. Great ideas have to be
true and new. And it takes a certain amount of ability to see new
ideas even once you've learned enough to get to one of the frontiers
of knowledge.<br><br>In English we give this ability names like originality, creativity,
and imagination. And it seems reasonable to give it a separate name,
because it does seem to some extent a separate skill. It's possible
to have a great deal of ability in other respects — to have a great
deal of what's often called <i>technical</i> ability — and yet not have
much of this.<br><br>I've never liked the term "creative process." It seems misleading.
Originality isn't a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkers
throw off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an angle
grinder throwing off sparks. They can't help it.<br><br>If the thing they're focused on is something they don't understand
very well, these new ideas might not be good. One of the most
original thinkers I know decided to focus on dating after he got
divorced. He knew roughly as much about dating as the average 15
year old, and the results were spectacularly colorful. But to see
originality separated from expertise like that made its nature all
the more clear.<br><br>I don't know if it's possible to cultivate originality, but there
are definitely ways to make the most of however much you have. For
example, you're much more likely to have original ideas when you're
working on something. Original ideas don't come from trying to have
original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something
slightly too difficult.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#dddddd">15</font></a>]</font><br><br>Talking or writing about the things you're interested in is a good
way to generate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, a
missing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you.
Indeed, there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing.<br><br>Changing your context can help. If you visit a new place, you'll
often find you have new ideas there. The journey itself often
dislodges them. But you may not have to go far to get this benefit.
Sometimes it's enough just to go for a walk.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#dddddd">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>It also helps to travel in topic space. You'll have more new ideas
if you explore lots of different topics, partly because it gives
the angle grinder more surface area to work on, and partly because
analogies are an especially fruitful source of new ideas.<br><br>Don't divide your attention <i>evenly</i> between many topics though,
or you'll spread yourself too thin. You want to distribute it
according to something more like a power law.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f17n"><font color="#dddddd">17</font></a>]</font>
Be professionally
curious about a few topics and idly curious about many more.<br><br>Curiosity and originality are closely related. Curiosity feeds
originality by giving it new things to work on. But the relationship
is closer than that. Curiosity is itself a kind of originality;
it's roughly to questions what originality is to answers. And since
questions at their best are a big component of answers, curiosity
at its best is a creative force.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Having new ideas is a strange game, because it usually consists of
seeing things that were right under your nose. Once you've seen a
new idea, it tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this
before?<br><br>When an idea seems simultaneously novel and obvious, it's probably
a good one.<br><br>Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having
new ideas is hard. What's the source of this apparent contradiction?
It's that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the
way you look at the world. We see the world through models that
both help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas
become obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard.
That's how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover:
they're easy to see after you do something hard.<br><br>One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other
people. Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues where
they bash against reality. Most people don't want to see these
clues. It would be an understatement to say that they're attached
to their current model; it's what they think in; so they'll tend
to ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however conspicuous
it may seem in retrospect.<br><br>To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage instead
of looking away. That's what Einstein did. He was able to see the
wild implications of Maxwell's equations not so much because he was
looking for new ideas as because he was stricter.<br><br>The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxical
as it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps
to be the sort of person who's comfortable breaking rules. From the
point of view of the old model, which everyone including you initially
shares, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules.<br><br>Few understand the degree of rule-breaking required, because new
ideas seem much more conservative once they succeed. They seem
perfectly reasonable once you're using the new model of the world
they brought with them. But they didn't at the time; it took the
greater part of a century for the heliocentric model to be generally
accepted, even among astronomers, because it felt so wrong.<br><br>Indeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to
most people, or someone would have already explored it. So what
you're looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of
crazy. How do you recognize these? You can't with certainty. Often
ideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are the right kind of
crazy tend to be exciting; they're rich in implications; whereas
ideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing.<br><br>There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy
breaking them, and to be indifferent to them. I call these two cases
being aggressively and passively independent-minded.<br><br>The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules
don't merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional
energy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer audacity of
a project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it
started.<br><br>The other way to break rules is not to care about them, or perhaps
even to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often
make new discoveries; their ignorance of a field's assumptions acts
as a source of temporary passive independent-mindedness. Aspies
also seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs.
Several I know say that this helps them to have new ideas.<br><br>Strictness plus rule-breaking sounds like a strange combination.
In popular culture they're opposed. But popular culture has a broken
model in this respect. It implicitly assumes that issues are trivial
ones, and in trivial matters strictness and rule-breaking <i>are</i>
opposed. But in questions that really matter, only rule-breakers
can be truly strict.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
An overlooked idea often doesn't lose till the semifinals. You do
see it, subconsciously, but then another part of your subconscious
shoots it down because it would be too weird, too risky, too much
work, too controversial. This suggests an exciting possibility: if
you could turn off such filters, you could see more new ideas.<br><br>One way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas for <i>someone
else</i> to explore. Then your subconscious won't shoot them down to
protect you.<br><br>You could also discover overlooked ideas by working in the other
direction: by starting from what's obscuring them. Every cherished
but mistaken principle is surrounded by a dead zone of valuable
ideas that are unexplored because they contradict it.<br><br>Religions are collections of cherished but mistaken principles. So
anything that can be described either literally or metaphorically
as a religion will have valuable unexplored ideas in its shadow.
Copernicus and Darwin both made discoveries of this type.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f18n"><font color="#dddddd">18</font></a>]</font><br><br>What are people in your field religious about, in the sense of being
too attached to some principle that might not be as self-evident
as they think? What becomes possible if you discard it?<br><br><br><br><br><br>
People show much more originality in solving problems than in
deciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly
conservative when deciding what to work on. People who'd never dream
of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on
fashionable problems.<br><br>One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than
solutions is that problems are bigger bets. A problem could occupy
you for years, while exploring a solution might only take days. But
even so I think most people are too conservative. They're not merely
responding to risk, but to fashion as well. Unfashionable problems
are undervalued.<br><br>One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is the
problem that people think has been fully explored, but hasn't.
Great work often takes something that already exists and shows its
latent potential. Durer and Watt both did this. So if you're
interested in a field that others think is tapped out, don't let
their skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this.<br><br>Working on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There's
no hype or hurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupied
elsewhere. The existing work often has an old-school solidity. And
there's a satisfying sense of economy in cultivating ideas that
would otherwise be wasted.<br><br>But the most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitly
unfashionable in the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn't
seem to matter as much as it actually does. How do you find these?
By being self-indulgent — by letting your curiosity have its way,
and tuning out, at least temporarily, the little voice in your head
that says you should only be working on "important" problems.<br><br>You do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone is
too conservative about what counts as one. And if there's an important
but overlooked problem in your neighborhood, it's probably already
on your subconscious radar screen. So try asking yourself: if you
were going to take a break from "serious" work to work on something
just because it would be really interesting, what would you do? The
answer is probably more important than it seems.<br><br>Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than
originality in solving them. That's what distinguishes the people
who discover whole new fields. So what might seem to be merely the
initial step — deciding what to work on — is in a sense the key
to the whole game.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Few grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas
is about the ratio of question to answer in their composition.
People think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight was
in the question.<br><br>Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they're used
in schools. In schools they tend to exist only briefly before being
answered, like unstable particles. But a really good question can
be much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery.
How do new species arise? Is the force that makes objects fall to
earth the same as the one that keeps planets in their orbits? By
even asking such questions you were already in excitingly novel
territory.<br><br>Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around
with you. But the more you're carrying, the greater the chance of
noticing a solution — or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing
that two unanswered questions are the same.<br><br>Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often
comes from returning to a question you first noticed years before
— in your childhood, even — and couldn't stop thinking about.
People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful
dreams alive, but it's just as important to keep your youthful
questions alive.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f19n"><font color="#dddddd">19</font></a>]</font><br><br>This is one of the places where actual expertise differs most from
the popular picture of it. In the popular picture, experts are
certain. But actually the more puzzled you are, the better, so long
as (a) the things you're puzzled about matter, and (b) no one else
understands them either.<br><br>Think about what's happening at the moment just before a new idea
is discovered. Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled
about something. Which means that originality consists partly of
puzzlement — of confusion! You have to be comfortable enough with
the world being full of puzzles that you're willing to see them,
but not so comfortable that you don't want to solve them.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f20n"><font color="#dddddd">20</font></a>]</font><br><br>It's a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. And this is
one of those situations where the rich get richer, because the best
way to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones.
Questions don't just lead to answers, but also to more questions.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread
protruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it
just gets longer and longer. So don't require a question to be
obviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict
that. It's hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to
predict how much will unravel if you pull on it.<br><br>It's better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit on
a lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The
initial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side
projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start
lots of small things.<br><br>Being prolific is underrated. The more different things you try,
the greater the chance of discovering something new. Understand,
though, that trying lots of things will mean trying lots of things
that don't work. You can't have a lot of good ideas without also
having a lot of bad ones.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f21n"><font color="#dddddd">21</font></a>]</font><br><br>Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything
that's been done before, you'll learn faster and have more fun by
trying stuff. And you'll understand previous work better when you
do look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier when
starting means starting small; those two ideas fit together like
two puzzle pieces.<br><br>How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By
making successive versions. Great things are almost always made in
successive versions. You start with something small and evolve it,
and the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than
anything you could have planned.<br><br>It's particularly useful to make successive versions when you're
making something for people — to get an initial version in front
of them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response.<br><br>Begin by trying the simplest thing that could possibly work.
Surprisingly often, it does. If it doesn't, this will at least get
you started.<br><br>Don't try to cram too much new stuff into any one version. There
are names for doing this with the first version (taking too long
to ship) and the second (the second system effect), but these are
both merely instances of a more general principle.<br><br>An early version of a new project will sometimes be dismissed as a
toy. It's a good sign when people do this. That means it has
everything a new idea needs except scale, and that tends to follow.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f22n"><font color="#dddddd">22</font></a>]</font><br><br>The alternative to starting with something small and evolving it
is to plan in advance what you're going to do. And planning does
usually seem the more responsible choice. It sounds more organized
to say "we're going to do x and then y and then z" than "we're going
to try x and see what happens." And it is more <i>organized</i>; it just
doesn't work as well.<br><br>Planning per se isn't good. It's sometimes necessary, but it's a
necessary evil — a response to unforgiving conditions. It's something
you have to do because you're working with inflexible media, or
because you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If
you keep projects small and use flexible media, you don't have to
plan as much, and your designs can evolve instead.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Take as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk
is proportionate to reward, so don't look for certainty, but for a
bet with high expected value. If you're not failing occasionally,
you're probably being too conservative.<br><br>Though conservatism is usually associated with the old, it's the
young who tend to make this mistake. Inexperience makes them fear
risk, but it's when you're young that you can afford the most.<br><br>Even a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of working
on it, you'll have crossed territory few others have seen, and
encountered questions few others have asked. And there's probably
no better source of questions than the ones you encounter in trying
to do something slightly too hard.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Use the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages
of age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy,
time, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge,
efficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some of
the latter when young and keep some of the former when old.<br><br>The old also have the advantage of knowing which advantages they
have. The young often have them without realizing it. The biggest
is probably time. The young have no idea how rich they are in time.
The best way to turn this time to advantage is to use it in slightly
frivolous ways: to learn about something you don't need to know
about, just out of curiosity, or to try building something just
because it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at something.<br><br>That "slightly" is an important qualification. Spend time lavishly
when you're young, but don't simply waste it. There's a big difference
between doing something you worry might be a waste of time and doing
something you know for sure will be. The former is at least a bet,
and possibly a better one than you think.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f23n"><font color="#dddddd">23</font></a>]</font><br><br>The most subtle advantage of youth, or more precisely of inexperience,
is that you're seeing everything with fresh eyes. When your brain
embraces an idea for the first time, sometimes the two don't fit
together perfectly. Usually the problem is with your brain, but
occasionally it's with the idea. A piece of it sticks out awkwardly
and jabs you when you think about it. People who are used to the
idea have learned to ignore it, but you have the opportunity not
to.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f24n"><font color="#dddddd">24</font></a>]</font><br><br>So when you're learning about something for the first time, pay
attention to things that seem wrong or missing. You'll be tempted
to ignore them, since there's a 99% chance the problem is with you.
And you may have to set aside your misgivings temporarily to keep
progressing. But don't forget about them. When you've gotten further
into the subject, come back and check if they're still there. If
they're still viable in the light of your present knowledge, they
probably represent an undiscovered idea.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
One of the most valuable kinds of knowledge you get from experience
is to know what you <i>don't</i> have to worry about. The young know all
the things that could matter, but not their relative importance.
So they worry equally about everything, when they should worry much
more about a few things and hardly at all about the rest.<br><br>But what you don't know is only half the problem with inexperience.
The other half is what you do know that ain't so. You arrive at
adulthood with your head full of nonsense — bad habits you've
acquired and false things you've been taught — and you won't be
able to do great work till you clear away at least the nonsense in
the way of whatever type of work you want to do.<br><br>Much of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools.
We're so used to schools that we unconsciously treat going to school
as identical with learning, but in fact schools have all sorts of
strange qualities that warp our ideas about learning and thinking.<br><br>For example, schools induce passivity. Since you were a small child,
there was an authority at the front of the class telling all of you
what you had to learn and then measuring whether you did. But neither
classes nor tests are intrinsic to learning; they're just artifacts
of the way schools are usually designed.<br><br>The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you're still
in school, try thinking of your education as your project, and your
teachers as working for you rather than vice versa. That may seem
a stretch, but it's not merely some weird thought experiment. It's
the truth economically, and in the best case it's the truth
intellectually as well. The best teachers don't want to be your
bosses. They'd prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a source
of advice, rather than being pulled by them through the material.<br><br>Schools also give you a misleading impression of what work is like.
In school they tell you what the problems are, and they're almost
always soluble using no more than you've been taught so far. In
real life you have to figure out what the problems are, and you
often don't know if they're soluble at all.<br><br>But perhaps the worst thing schools do to you is train you to win
by hacking the test. You can't do great work by doing that. You
can't trick God. So stop looking for that kind of shortcut. The way
to beat the system is to focus on problems and solutions that others
have overlooked, not to skimp on the work itself.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Don't think of yourself as dependent on some gatekeeper giving you
a "big break." Even if this were true, the best way to get it would
be to focus on doing good work rather than chasing influential
people.<br><br>And don't take rejection by committees to heart. The qualities that
impress admissions officers and prize committees are quite different
from those required to do great work. The decisions of selection
committees are only meaningful to the extent that they're part of
a feedback loop, and very few are.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
People new to a field will often copy existing work. There's nothing
inherently bad about that. There's no better way to learn how
something works than by trying to reproduce it. Nor does
copying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is the
presence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones.<br><br>There's a good way to copy and a bad way. If you're going to copy
something, do it openly instead of furtively, or worse still,
unconsciously. This is what's meant by the famously misattributed
phrase "Great artists steal." The really dangerous kind of copying,
the kind that gives copying a bad name, is the kind that's done
without realizing it, because you're nothing more than a train
running on tracks laid down by someone else. But at the other
extreme, copying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f25n"><font color="#dddddd">25</font></a>]</font><br><br>In many fields it's almost inevitable that your early work will be
in some sense based on other people's. Projects rarely arise in a
vacuum. They're usually a reaction to previous work. When you're
first starting out, you don't have any previous work; if you're
going to react to something, it has to be someone else's. Once
you're established, you can react to your own. But while the former
gets called derivative and the latter doesn't, structurally the two
cases are more similar than they seem.<br><br>Oddly enough, the very novelty of the most novel ideas sometimes
makes them seem at first to be more derivative than they are. New
discoveries often have to be conceived initially as variations of
existing things, <i>even by their discoverers</i>, because there isn't
yet the conceptual vocabulary to express them.<br><br>There are definitely some dangers to copying, though. One is that
you'll tend to copy old things — things that were in their day at
the frontier of knowledge, but no longer are.<br><br>And when you do copy something, don't copy every feature of it.
Some will make you ridiculous if you do. Don't copy the manner of
an eminent 50 year old professor if you're 18, for example, or the
idiom of a Renaissance poem hundreds of years later.<br><br>Some of the features of things you admire are flaws they succeeded
despite. Indeed, the features that are easiest to imitate are the
most likely to be the flaws.<br><br>This is particularly true for behavior. Some talented people are
jerks, and this sometimes makes it seem to the inexperienced that
being a jerk is part of being talented. It isn't; being talented
is merely how they get away with it.<br><br>One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from
one field into another. History is so full of chance discoveries
of this type that it's probably worth giving chance a hand by
deliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideas
from quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors.<br><br>Negative examples can be as inspiring as positive ones. In fact you
can sometimes learn more from things done badly than from things
done well; sometimes it only becomes clear what's needed when it's
missing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
If a lot of the best people in your field are collected in one
place, it's usually a good idea to visit for a while. It will
increase your ambition, and also, by showing you that these people
are human, increase your self-confidence.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f26n"><font color="#dddddd">26</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you're earnest you'll probably get a warmer welcome than you
might expect. Most people who are very good at something are happy
to talk about it with anyone who's genuinely interested. If they're
really good at their work, then they probably have a hobbyist's
interest in it, and hobbyists always want to talk about their
hobbies.<br><br>It may take some effort to find the people who are really good,
though. Doing great work has such prestige that in some places,
particularly universities, there's a polite fiction that everyone
is engaged in it. And that is far from true. People within universities
can't say so openly, but the quality of the work being done in
different departments varies immensely. Some departments have people
doing great work; others have in the past; others never have.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Seek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can't
be done alone, and even if you're working on one that can be, it's
good to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off.<br><br>Colleagues don't just affect your work, though; they also affect
you. So work with people you want to become like, because you will.<br><br>Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It's better
to have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good
ones. In fact it's not merely better, but necessary, judging from
history: the degree to which great work happens in clusters suggests
that one's colleagues often make the difference between doing great
work and not.<br><br>How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues? In my
experience, when you do, you know. Which means if you're unsure,
you probably don't. But it may be possible to give a more concrete
answer than that. Here's an attempt: sufficiently good colleagues
offer <i>surprising</i> insights. They can see and do things that you
can't. So if you have a handful of colleagues good enough to keep
you on your toes in this sense, you're probably over the threshold.<br><br>Most of us can benefit from collaborating with colleagues, but some
projects require people on a larger scale, and starting one of those
is not for everyone. If you want to run a project like that, you'll
have to become a manager, and managing well takes aptitude and
interest like any other kind of work. If you don't have them, there
is no middle path: you must either force yourself to learn management
as a second language, or avoid such projects.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f27n"><font color="#dddddd">27</font></a>]</font><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Husband your morale. It's the basis of everything when you're working
on ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a
living organism.<br><br>Morale starts with your view of life. You're more likely to do great
work if you're an optimist, and more likely to if you think of
yourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim.<br><br>Indeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. If
you choose work that's pure, its very difficulties will serve as a
refuge from the difficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism,
it's a very productive form of it, and one that has been used by
some of the greatest minds in history.<br><br>Morale compounds via work: high morale helps you do good work, which
increases your morale and helps you do even better work. But this
cycle also operates in the other direction: if you're not doing
good work, that can demoralize you and make it even harder to. Since
it matters so much for this cycle to be running in the right
direction, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work when
you're stuck, just so you start to get something done.<br><br>One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow
setbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting.
You can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering
setbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always
involves some backtracking.<br><br>Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the
desire to. So "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again" isn't
quite right. It should be: If at first you don't succeed, either
try again, or backtrack and then try again.<br><br>"Never give up" is also not quite right. Obviously there are times
when it's the right choice to eject. A more precise version would
be: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you
need to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.<br><br>It's not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any more
than it's a bad sign to be out of breath while running. It depends
how fast you're running. So learn to distinguish good pain from
bad. Good pain is a sign of effort; bad pain is a sign of damage.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
An audience is a critical component of morale. If you're a scholar,
your audience may be your peers; in the arts, it may be an audience
in the traditional sense. Either way it doesn't need to be big.
The value of an audience doesn't grow anything like linearly with
its size. Which is bad news if you're famous, but good news if
you're just starting out, because it means a small but dedicated
audience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of people
genuinely love what you're doing, that's enough.<br><br>To the extent you can, avoid letting intermediaries come between
you and your audience. In some types of work this is inevitable,
but it's so liberating to escape it that you might be better off
switching to an adjacent type if that will let you go direct.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f28n"><font color="#dddddd">28</font></a>]</font><br><br>The people you spend time with will also have a big effect on your
morale. You'll find there are some who increase your energy and
others who decrease it, and the effect someone has is not always
what you'd expect. Seek out the people who increase your energy and
avoid those who decrease it. Though of course if there's someone
you need to take care of, that takes precedence.<br><br>Don't marry someone who doesn't understand that you need to work,
or sees your work as competition for your attention. If you're
ambitious, you need to work; it's almost like a medical condition;
so someone who won't let you work either doesn't understand you,
or does and doesn't care.<br><br>Ultimately morale is physical. You think with your body, so it's
important to take care of it. That means exercising regularly,
eating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds of
drugs. Running and walking are particularly good forms of exercise
because they're good for thinking.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f29n"><font color="#dddddd">29</font></a>]</font><br><br>People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone
else, but they're happier than they'd be if they didn't. In fact,
if you're smart and ambitious, it's dangerous <i>not</i> to be productive.
People who are smart and ambitious but don't achieve much tend to
become bitter.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
It's ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people.
The opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the
opinion of a much larger group you might or might not respect, just
adds noise.<br><br>The prestige of a type of work is at best a trailing indicator and
sometimes completely mistaken. If you do anything well enough,
you'll make it prestigious. So the question to ask about a type of
work is not how much prestige it has, but how well it could be done.<br><br>Competition can be an effective motivator, but don't let it choose
the problem for you; don't let yourself get drawn into chasing
something just because others are. In fact, don't let competitors
make you do anything much more specific than work harder.<br><br>Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows
more than you do about what's worth paying attention to.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Notice how often that word has come up. If you asked an oracle the
secret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single
word, my bet would be on "curiosity."<br><br>That doesn't translate directly to advice. It's not enough just to
be curious, and you can't command curiosity anyway. But you can
nurture it and let it drive you.<br><br>Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will
choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to
notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole
process is a kind of dance with curiosity.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Believe it or not, I tried to make this essay as short as I could.
But its length at least means it acts as a filter. If you made it
this far, you must be interested in doing great work. And if so
you're already further along than you might realize, because the
set of people willing to want to is small.<br><br>The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal,
mathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and
luck. Luck by definition you can't do anything about, so we can
ignore that. And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want to
do great work. So the problem boils down to ability and interest.
Can you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will
combine to yield an explosion of new ideas?<br><br>Here there are grounds for optimism. There are so many different
ways to do great work, and even more that are still undiscovered.
Out of all those different types of work, the one you're most suited
for is probably a pretty close match. Probably a comically close
match. It's just a question of finding it, and how far into it your
ability and interest can take you. And you can only answer that by
trying.<br><br>Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds
them back is a combination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuous
to try to be Newton or Shakespeare. It also seems hard; surely if
you tried something like that, you'd fail. Presumably the calculation
is rarely explicit. Few people consciously decide not to try to do
great work. But that's what's going on subconsciously; they shy
away from the question.<br><br>So I'm going to pull a sneaky trick on you. Do you want to do great
work, or not? Now you have to decide consciously. Sorry about that.
I wouldn't have done it to a general audience. But we already know
you're interested.<br><br>Don't worry about being presumptuous. You don't have to tell anyone.
And if it's too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people have
worse problems than that. In fact you'll be lucky if it's the worst
problem you have.<br><br>Yes, you'll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have to
work hard. And if you're working on something you find very
interesting, which you necessarily will if you're on the right path,
the work will probably feel less burdensome than a lot of your
peers'.<br><br>The discoveries are out there, waiting to be made. Why not by you?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I don't think you could give a precise definition of what
counts as great work. Doing great work means doing something important
so well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible. But
there's no threshold for importance. It's a matter of degree, and
often hard to judge at the time anyway. So I'd rather people focused
on developing their interests rather than worrying about whether
they're important or not. Just try to do something amazing, and
leave it to future generations to say if you succeeded.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
A lot of standup comedy is based on noticing anomalies in
everyday life. "Did you ever notice...?" New ideas come from doing
this about nontrivial things. Which may help explain why people's
reaction to a new idea is often the first half of laughing: Ha!<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
That second qualifier is critical. If you're excited about
something most authorities discount, but you can't give a more
precise explanation than "they don't get it," then you're starting
to drift into the territory of cranks.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Finding something to work on is not simply a matter of finding
a match between the current version of you and a list of known
problems. You'll often have to coevolve with the problem. That's
why it can sometimes be so hard to figure out what to work on. The
search space is huge. It's the cartesian product of all possible
types of work, both known and yet to be discovered, and all possible
future versions of you.<br><br>There's no way you could search this whole space, so you have to
rely on heuristics to generate promising paths through it and hope
the best matches will be clustered. Which they will not always be;
different types of work have been collected together as much by
accidents of history as by the intrinsic similarities between them.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
There are many reasons curious people are more likely to do
great work, but one of the more subtle is that, by casting a wide
net, they're more likely to find the right thing to work on in the
first place.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
It can also be dangerous to make things for an audience you
feel is less sophisticated than you, if that causes you to talk
down to them. You can make a lot of money doing that, if you do it
in a sufficiently cynical way, but it's not the route to great work.
Not that anyone using this m.o. would care.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
This idea I learned from Hardy's <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>,
which I recommend to anyone ambitious to do great work, in any
field.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Just as we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate
what we can do over several years, we overestimate the damage done

procrastinating for several years.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
You can't usually get paid for doing exactly what you want,
especially early on. There are two options: get paid for doing work
close to what you want and hope to push it closer, or get paid for
doing something else entirely and do your own projects on the side.
Both can work, but both have drawbacks: in the first approach your
work is compromised by default, and in the second you have to fight
to get time to do it.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
If you set your life up right, it will deliver the focus-relax
cycle automatically. The perfect setup is an office you work in and
that you walk to and from.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
There may be some very unworldly people who do great work
without consciously trying to. If you want to expand this rule to
cover that case, it becomes: Don't try to be anything except the
best.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
This gets more complicated in work like acting, where the
goal is to adopt a fake persona. But even here it's possible to be
affected. Perhaps the rule in such fields should be to avoid
<i>unintentional</i> affectation.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
It's safe to have beliefs that you treat as unquestionable
if and only if they're also unfalsifiable. For example, it's safe
to have the principle that everyone should be treated equally under
the law, because a sentence with a "should" in it isn't really a
statement about the world and is therefore hard to disprove. And
if there's no evidence that could disprove one of your principles,
there can't be any facts you'd need to ignore in order to preserve
it.<br><br>[<a name="f14n"><font color="#000000">14</font></a>]
Affectation is easier to cure than intellectual dishonesty.
Affectation is often a shortcoming of the young that burns off in
time, while intellectual dishonesty is more of a character flaw.<br><br>[<a name="f15n"><font color="#000000">15</font></a>]
Obviously you don't have to be working at the exact moment
you have the idea, but you'll probably have been working fairly

Some say psychoactive drugs have a similar effect. I'm
skeptical, but also almost totally ignorant of their effects.<br><br>[<a name="f17n"><font color="#000000">17</font></a>]
For example you might give the nth most important topic
(m-1)/m^n of your attention, for some m &gt; 1. You couldn't allocate
your attention so precisely, of course, but this at least gives an
idea of a reasonable distribution.<br><br>[<a name="f18n"><font color="#000000">18</font></a>]
The principles defining a religion have to be mistaken.
Otherwise anyone might adopt them, and there would be nothing to
distinguish the adherents of the religion from everyone else.<br><br>[<a name="f19n"><font color="#000000">19</font></a>]
It might be a good exercise to try writing down a list of
questions you wondered about in your youth. You might find you're
now in a position to do something about some of them.<br><br>[<a name="f20n"><font color="#000000">20</font></a>]
The connection between originality and uncertainty causes a
strange phenomenon: because the conventional-minded are more certain
than the independent-minded, this tends to give them the upper hand
in disputes, even though they're generally stupider.

you must have many ideas."<br><br>[<a name="f22n"><font color="#000000">22</font></a>]
Attacking a project as a "toy" is similar to attacking a
statement as "inappropriate." It means that no more substantial
criticism can be made to stick.<br><br>[<a name="f23n"><font color="#000000">23</font></a>]
One way to tell whether you're wasting time is to ask if
you're producing or consuming. Writing computer games is less likely
to be a waste of time than playing them, and playing games where
you create something is less likely to be a waste of time than
playing games where you don't.<br><br>[<a name="f24n"><font color="#000000">24</font></a>]
Another related advantage is that if you haven't said anything
publicly yet, you won't be biased toward evidence that supports
your earlier conclusions. With sufficient integrity you could achieve
eternal youth in this respect, but few manage to. For most people,
having previously published opinions has an effect similar to
ideology, just in quantity 1.<br><br>[<a name="f25n"><font color="#000000">25</font></a>]
In the early 1630s Daniel Mytens made a painting of Henrietta
Maria handing a laurel wreath to Charles I. Van Dyck then painted

I'm being deliberately vague about what a place is. As of
this writing, being in the same physical place has advantages that
are hard to duplicate, but that could change.<br><br>[<a name="f27n"><font color="#000000">27</font></a>]
This is false when the work the other people have to do is
very constrained, as with SETI@home or Bitcoin. It may be possible
to expand the area in which it's false by defining similarly
restricted protocols with more freedom of action in the nodes.<br><br>[<a name="f28n"><font color="#000000">28</font></a>]
Corollary: Building something that enables people to go around
intermediaries and engage directly with their audience is probably
a good idea.<br><br>[<a name="f29n"><font color="#000000">29</font></a>]
It may be helpful always to walk or run the same route, because
that frees attention for thinking. It feels that way to me, and
there is some historical evidence for it.<br><br><br><br><font color="888888"><b>Thanks</b>

when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance
are superlinear.<br><br>Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear.
"You get out," I heard a thousand times, "what you put in." They
meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half
as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers.
You get no customers, and you go out of business.<br><br>It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear
in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if
we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear
returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact
of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power,
military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all
of these, the rich get richer.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>You can't understand the world without understanding the concept
of superlinear returns. And if you're ambitious you definitely
should, because this will be the wave you surf on.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with
superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two
fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds.<br><br>The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working
on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial
cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they're
tricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone
who's adept at it and someone who's not is very great.<br><br>Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern
there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don't. And
as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies
with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the
ones with lower growth rates may not even survive.<br><br>Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather
than absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early
on, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them
decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to
tell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that
by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows
exponentially.<br><br>YC doesn't explicitly tell founders that with growth rate "you get
out what you put in," but it's not far from the truth. And if growth
rate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance
<i>p</i> over time <i>t</i> would be proportional to <i>p<sup>t</sup></i>.<br><br>Even after decades of thinking about this, I find that sentence
startling.<br><br>Whenever how well you do depends on how well you've done, you'll
get exponential growth. But neither our DNA nor our customs prepare
us for it. No one finds exponential growth natural; every child is
surprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man who
asks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and double
the amount each successive day.<br><br>What we don't understand naturally we develop customs to deal with,
but we don't have many customs about exponential growth either,
because there have been so few instances of it in human history.
In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you
had, the more offspring they'd have. But in practice grazing land
was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that
exponentially.<br><br>Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. There <i>was</i> a way
to grow one's territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory
you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier
it is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of
empires. But so few people created or ran empires that their
experiences didn't affect customs very much. The emperor was a
remote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could use
in one's own life.<br><br>The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times
was probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is to
learn new things. The result, then as now, was that some people
were startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain
topics. But this didn't affect customs much either. Although empires
of ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in
preindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>That has changed in the last few centuries. Now the emperors of
ideas can design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory. But
this phenomenon is still so new that we haven't fully assimilated
it. Few even of the participants realize they're benefitting from
exponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instances
of it.<br><br>The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression
"winner take all." In a sports match the relationship between
performance and return is a step function: the winning team gets
one win whether they do much better or just slightly better.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The source of the step function is not competition per se, however.
It's that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don't need
competition to get those. There can be thresholds in situations
where you're the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting
a target.<br><br>It's remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear
returns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential
growth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage,
which makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponential
growth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects,
a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors.<br><br>Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both
sources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially because
existing fans bring you new ones. But the fundamental reason it's
so concentrated is thresholds: there's only so much room on the
A-list in the average person's head.<br><br>The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns
may be learning. Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are also
thresholds in it. Learning to ride a bicycle, for example. Some of
these thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read,
you're able to learn anything else much faster. But the most important
thresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge
seems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the
boundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole
new field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new
discoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and
Darwin.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Are there general rules for finding situations with superlinear
returns? The most obvious one is to seek work that compounds.<br><br>There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in
the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in
the next. That happens for example when you're building infrastructure,
or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching
you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting
one because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening. You
may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you're learning
a lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless.<br><br>This is one reason Silicon Valley is so tolerant of failure. People
in Silicon Valley aren't blindly tolerant of failure. They'll only
continue to bet on you if you're learning from your failures. But
if you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn't
grow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should
yield results eventually.<br><br>Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don't consist of
learning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably
treat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yields
another heuristic: always be learning. If you're not learning,
you're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns.<br><br>But don't overoptimize <i>what</i> you're learning. Don't limit yourself
to learning things that are already known to be valuable. You're
learning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable,
and if you're too strict you'll lop off the outliers.<br><br>What about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of the
form "seek thresholds" or "seek competition?" Here the situation
is trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn't guarantee the
game will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette,
you'll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the
best case you're no better off. "Seek competition" is similarly
useless; what if the prize isn't worth competing for? Sufficiently
fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of
the return curve — because something that grows fast enough will
grow big even if it's trivially small at first — but thresholds
only guarantee the shape.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a
test to ensure the game is worth playing. Here's one that does: if
you come across something that's mediocre yet still popular, it
could be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes
a product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they'd
buy a better alternative if you made one.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#dddddd">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual
thresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new
fields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty,
but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have
predictors that were even a little better than random, and there's
hope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research
problem <i>isn't</i> likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems
legit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries
tend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they
were mystifying and obviously important, they'd be famous open
questions with lots of people already working on them.) So one
heuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism
— to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what
you're supposed to.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The prospect of superlinear returns for performance is an exciting
one for the ambitious. And there's good news in this department:
this territory is expanding in both directions. There are more types
of work in which you can get superlinear returns, and the returns
themselves are growing.<br><br>There are two reasons for this, though they're so closely intertwined
that they're more like one and a half: progress in technology, and
the decreasing importance of organizations.<br><br>Fifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of an
organization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way to
get the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and
the only way to get distribution. So in 1970 your prestige was in
most cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to. And
prestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren't part of
an organization, you weren't likely to achieve much. There were a
handful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who worked
alone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands. But even
they were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#dddddd">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>A world dominated by organizations damped variation in the returns
for performance. But this world has eroded significantly just in
my lifetime. Now a lot more people can have the freedom that artists
and writers had in the 20th century. There are lots of ambitious
projects that don't require much initial funding, and lots of new
ways to learn, make money, find colleagues, and reach audiences.<br><br>There's still plenty of the old world left, but the rate of change
has been dramatic by historical standards. Especially considering
what's at stake. It's hard to imagine a more fundamental change
than one in the returns for performance.<br><br>Without the damping effect of institutions, there will be more
variation in outcomes. Which doesn't imply everyone will be better
off: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badly
will do worse. That's an important point to bear in mind. Exposing
oneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone. Most people
will be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot for
superlinear returns? Ambitious people of two types: those who know
they're so good that they'll be net ahead in a world with higher
variation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to
risk trying it to find out.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#dddddd">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>The switch away from institutions won't simply be an exodus of their
current inhabitants. Many of the new winners will be people they'd
never have let in. So the resulting democratization of opportunity
will be both greater and more authentic than any tame intramural
version the institutions themselves might have cooked up.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Not everyone is happy about this great unlocking of ambition. It
threatens some vested interests and contradicts some ideologies.&nbsp;<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#dddddd">8</font></a>]</font>
But if you're an ambitious individual it's good news for you.
How should you take advantage of it?<br><br>The most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns for
performance is by doing exceptionally good work. At the far end of
the curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so because
there's less competition at the far end — and not just for the
obvious reason that it's hard to do something exceptionally well,
but also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few
even try. Which means it's not just a bargain to do exceptional
work, but a bargain even to try to.<br><br>There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if
you want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right.
For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be
interested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world with
superlinear returns, it's even more valuable to know what you're
interested in, and to find ways to work on it.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#dddddd">9</font></a>]</font>
It will also be
important to choose work that suits your circumstances. For example,
if there's a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure
of time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it when
you're young and don't yet have children.<br><br>There's a surprising amount of technique to doing great work.
It's not just a matter of trying hard. I'm going to take a shot
giving a recipe in one paragraph.<br><br>Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in.
Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn't matter
what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work
as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually
bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth
from a distance, but up close they're full of gaps. Notice and
explore such gaps, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole
new field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you're not failing
occasionally you're probably being too conservative. Seek out the
best colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples.
Be honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep
well and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your
curiosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's
worth paying attention to.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#dddddd">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>And there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky. Luck
is always a factor, but it's even more of a factor when you're
working on your own rather than as part of an organization. And
though there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where
preparedness meets opportunity and so on, there's also a component
of true chance that you can't do anything about. The solution is
to take multiple shots. Which is another reason to start taking
risks early.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The best example of a field with superlinear returns is probably
science. It has exponential growth, in the form of learning, combined
with thresholds at the extreme edge of performance — literally at
the limits of knowledge.<br><br>The result has been a level of inequality in scientific discovery
that makes the wealth inequality of even the most stratified societies
seem mild by comparison. Newton's discoveries were arguably greater
than all his contemporaries' combined.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#dddddd">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>This point may seem obvious, but it might be just as well to spell
it out. Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return
curve, the greater the variation in outcomes.<br><br>In fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequality
is so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work of
this type: look for fields where a few big winners outperform
everyone else. A kind of work where everyone does about the same
is unlikely to be one with superlinear returns.<br><br>What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else?
Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting,
directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing.
In sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds;
you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In
politics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And
in some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven
largely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth.
But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a
remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same
as the list of fields where you have to be <a href="think.html"><u>independent-minded</u></a> to
succeed — where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel
as well.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#dddddd">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>This is obviously the case in science. You can't publish papers
saying things that other people have already said. But it's just
as true in investing, for example. It's only useful to believe that
a company will do well if most other investors don't; if everyone
else thinks the company will do well, then its stock price will
already reflect that, and there's no room to make money.<br><br>What else can we learn from these fields? In all of them you have
to put in the initial effort. Superlinear returns seem small at
first. <i>At this rate,</i> you find yourself thinking, <i>I'll never get
anywhere.</i> But because the reward curve rises so steeply at the far
end, it's worth taking extraordinary measures to get there.<br><br>In the startup world, the name for this principle is "do things
that don't scale." If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to
your tiny initial set of customers, ideally you'll kick off exponential
growth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anything
that grows exponentially. Learning, for example. When you first
start learning something, you feel lost. But it's worth making the
initial effort to get a toehold, because the more you learn, the
easier it will get.<br><br>There's another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with
superlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the
20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a
result we've inherited a custom that equates productivity with
having a job. Even now to most people the phrase "your work" means
their job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever
they're currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their
work is something they carry with them from job to job, if they
have jobs at all. It may be done for an employer, but it's part of
their portfolio.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
It's an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big
winners outperform everyone else. Some people do this deliberately,
but you don't need to. If you have sufficient natural ability and
you follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you'll end up in one.
Your curiosity won't let you be interested in boring questions, and
interesting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returns
if they're not already part of one.<br><br>The territory of superlinear returns is by no means static. Indeed,
the most extreme returns come from expanding it. So while both
ambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity
may be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make you
climb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting
enough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>There's a limit to how sharply you can distinguish between effort,
performance, and return, because they're not sharply distinguished
in fact. What counts as return to one person might be performance
to another. But though the borders of these concepts are blurry,
they're not meaningless. I've tried to write about them as precisely
as I could without crossing into error.<br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Evolution itself is probably the most pervasive example of
superlinear returns for performance. But this is hard for us to
empathize with because we're not the recipients; we're the returns.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Knowledge did of course have a practical effect before the
Industrial Revolution. The development of agriculture changed human
life completely. But this kind of change was the result of broad,
gradual improvements in technique, not the discoveries of a few
exceptionally learned people.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
It's not mathematically correct to describe a step function as
superlinear, but a step function starting from zero works like a
superlinear function when it describes the reward curve for effort
by a rational actor. If it starts at zero then the part before the
step is below any linearly increasing return, and the part after
the step must be above the necessary return at that point or no one
would bother.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Seeking competition could be a good heuristic in the sense that
some people find it motivating. It's also somewhat of a guide to
promising problems, because it's a sign that other people find them
promising. But it's a very imperfect sign: often there's a clamoring
crowd chasing some problem, and they all end up being trumped by
someone quietly working on another one.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
Not always, though. You have to be careful with this rule. When
something is popular despite being mediocre, there's often a hidden
reason why. Perhaps monopoly or regulation make it hard to compete.
Perhaps customers have bad taste or have broken procedures for
deciding what to buy. There are huge swathes of mediocre things
that exist for such reasons.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
In my twenties I wanted to be an <a href="worked.html"><u>artist</u></a> 
and even went to art
school to study painting. Mostly because I liked art, but a nontrivial
part of my motivation came from the fact that artists seemed least
at the mercy of organizations.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
In principle everyone is getting superlinear returns. Learning
compounds, and everyone learns in the course of their life. But in
practice few push this kind of everyday learning to the point where
the return curve gets really steep.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
It's unclear exactly what advocates of "equity" mean by it.
They seem to disagree among themselves. But whatever they mean is
probably at odds with a world in which institutions have less power
to control outcomes, and a handful of outliers do much better than
everyone else.<br><br>It may seem like bad luck for this concept that it arose at just
the moment when the world was shifting in the opposite direction,
but I don't think this was a coincidence. I think one reason it
arose now is because its adherents feel threatened by rapidly
increasing variation in performance.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Corollary: Parents who pressure their kids to work on something
prestigious, like medicine, even though they have no interest in
it, will be hosing them even more than they have in the past.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
The original version of this paragraph was the first draft of
"<a href="greatwork.html"><u>How to Do Great Work</u></a>." 
As soon as I wrote it I realized it was a more important topic than superlinear
returns, so I paused the present essay to expand this paragraph into its
own. Practically nothing remains of the original version, because
after I finished "How to Do Great Work" I rewrote it based on that.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
Before the Industrial Revolution, people who got rich usually
did it like emperors: capturing some resource made them more powerful
and enabled them to capture more. Now it can be done like a scientist,
by discovering or building something uniquely valuable. Most people
who get rich use a mix of the old and the new ways, but in the most
advanced economies the ratio has <a href="richnow.html"><u>shifted dramatically</u></a> toward discovery
just in the last half century.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
It's not surprising that conventional-minded people would
dislike inequality if independent-mindedness is one of the biggest
drivers of it. But it's not simply that they don't want anyone to
have what they can't. The conventional-minded literally can't imagine
what it's like to have novel ideas. So the whole phenomenon of great
variation in performance seems unnatural to them, and when they
encounter it they assume it must be due to cheating or to some
malign external influence.<br><br><br><br><font color="888888"><b>Thanks</b>

My goal
here is to figure out what the best essay would be like.<br><br>It would be well-written, but you can write well about any topic.
What made it special would be what it was about.<br><br>Obviously some topics would be better than others. It probably
wouldn't be about this year's lipstick colors. But it wouldn't be
vaporous talk about elevated themes either. A good essay has to be
surprising. It has to tell people something they don't already know.<br><br>The best essay would be on the most important topic you could tell
people something surprising about.<br><br>That may sound obvious, but it has some unexpected consequences.
One is that science enters the picture like an elephant stepping
into a rowboat. For example, Darwin first described the idea of
natural selection in an essay written in 1844.
Talk about an
important topic you could tell people something surprising about.
If that's the test of a great essay, this was surely the best one
written in 1844. 
And indeed, the best possible essay at any given
time would usually be one describing the most important scientific
or technological discovery it was possible to make.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another unexpected consequence: I imagined when I started writing
this that the best essay would be fairly timeless — that the best
essay you could write in 1844 would be much the same as the best
one you could write now. But in fact the opposite seems to be true.
It might be true that the best painting would be timeless in this
sense. But it wouldn't be impressive to write an essay introducing
natural selection now. The best essay <i>now</i> would be one describing
a great discovery we didn't yet know about.<br><br>If the question of how to write the best possible essay reduces to
the question of how to make great discoveries, then I started with
the wrong question. Perhaps what this exercise shows is that we
shouldn't waste our time writing essays but instead focus on making
discoveries in some specific domain. But I'm interested in essays
and what can be done with them, so I want to see if there's some
other question I could have asked.<br><br>There is, and on the face of it, it seems almost identical to the
one I started with. Instead of asking <i>what would the best essay
be?</i> I should have asked <i>how do you write essays well?</i> Though
these seem only phrasing apart, their answers diverge. The answer
to the first question, as we've seen, isn't really about essay
writing. The second question forces it to be.<br><br>Writing essays, at its best, is a way of discovering ideas. How do
you do that well? How do you discover by writing?<br><br>An essay should ordinarily start with what I'm going to call a
question, though I mean this in a very general sense: it doesn't
have to be a question grammatically, just something that acts like
one in the sense that it spurs some response.<br><br>How do you get this initial question? It probably won't work to
choose some important-sounding topic at random and go at it.
Professional traders won't even trade unless they have what they
call an <i>edge</i> — a convincing story about why in some class of
trades they'll win more than they lose. Similarly, you shouldn't
attack a topic unless you have a way in — some new insight about
it or way of approaching it.<br><br>You don't need to have a complete thesis; you just need some kind
of gap you can explore. In fact, merely having questions about
something other people take for granted can be edge enough.<br><br>If you come across a question that's sufficiently puzzling, it could
be worth exploring even if it doesn't seem very momentous. Many an
important discovery has been made by pulling on a thread that seemed
insignificant at first. How can they <i>all</i> be finches? 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Once you've got a question, then what? You start thinking out loud
about it. Not literally out loud, but you commit to a specific
string of words in response, as you would if you were talking. This
initial response is usually mistaken or incomplete. Writing converts
your ideas from vague to bad. But that's a step forward, because
once you can see the brokenness, you can fix it.<br><br>Perhaps beginning writers are alarmed at the thought of starting
with something mistaken or incomplete, but you shouldn't be, because
this is why essay writing works. Forcing yourself to commit to some
specific string of words gives you a starting point, and if it's
wrong, you'll see that when you reread it. At least half of essay
writing is rereading what you've written and asking <i>is this correct
and complete?</i> You have to be very strict when rereading, not just
because you want to keep yourself honest, but because a gap between
your response and the truth is often a sign of new ideas to be
discovered.<br><br>The prize for being strict with what you've written is not just
refinement. When you take a roughly correct answer and try to make
it exactly right, sometimes you find that you can't, and that the
reason is that you were depending on a false assumption. And when
you discard it, the answer turns out to be completely different.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Ideally the response to a question is two things: the first step
in a process that converges on the truth, and a source of additional
questions (in my very general sense of the word). So the process
continues recursively, as response spurs response. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>Usually there are several possible responses to a question, which
means you're traversing a tree. But essays are linear, not tree-shaped,
which means you have to choose one branch to follow at each point.
How do you choose? Usually you should follow whichever offers the
greatest combination of generality and novelty. I don't consciously
rank branches this way; I just follow whichever seems most exciting;
but generality and novelty are what make a branch exciting. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#dddddd">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you're willing to do a lot of rewriting, you don't have to guess
right. You can follow a branch and see how it turns out, and if it
isn't good enough, cut it and backtrack. I do this all the time.
In this essay I've already cut a 17-paragraph subtree, in addition
to countless shorter ones. Maybe I'll reattach it at the end, or
boil it down to a footnote, or spin it off as its own essay; we'll
see. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#dddddd">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>In general you want to be quick to cut. One of the most dangerous
temptations in writing (and in software and painting) is to keep
something that isn't right, just because it contains a few good bits
or cost you a lot of effort.<br><br>The most surprising new question being thrown off at this point is
<i>does it really matter what the initial question is?</i> If the space
of ideas is highly connected, it shouldn't, because you should be
able to get from any question to the most valuable ones in a few
hops. And we see evidence that it's highly connected in the way,
for example, that people who are obsessed with some topic can turn
any conversation toward it. But that only works if you know where
you want to go, and you don't in an essay. That's the whole point.
You don't want to be the obsessive conversationalist, or all your
essays will be about the same thing. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#dddddd">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>The other reason the initial question matters is that you usually
feel somewhat obliged to stick to it. I don't think about this when
I decide which branch to follow. I just follow novelty and generality.
Sticking to the question is enforced later, when I notice I've
wandered too far and have to backtrack. But I think this is
the optimal solution. You don't want the hunt for novelty and
generality to be constrained in the moment. Go with it and see what
you get.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#dddddd">8</font></a>]</font><br><br>Since the initial question does constrain you, in the best case it
sets an upper bound on the quality of essay you'll write. If you
do as well as you possibly can on the chain of thoughts that follow
from the initial question, the initial question itself is the only
place where there's room for variation.<br><br>It would be a mistake to let this make you too conservative though,
because you can't predict where a question will lead. Not if you're
doing things right, because doing things right means making
discoveries, and by definition you can't predict those. So the way
to respond to this situation is not to be cautious about which
initial question you choose, but to write a lot of essays. Essays
are for taking risks.<br><br>Almost any question can get you a good essay. Indeed, it took some
effort to think of a sufficiently unpromising topic in the third
paragraph, because any essayist's first impulse on hearing that the
best essay couldn't be about x would be to try to write it. But if
most questions yield good essays, only some yield great ones.<br><br>Can we predict which questions will yield great essays? Considering
how long I've been writing essays, it's alarming how novel that
question feels.<br><br>One thing I like in an initial question is outrageousness. I love
questions that seem naughty in some way — for example, by seeming
counterintuitive or overambitious or heterodox. Ideally all three.
This essay is an example. Writing about the best essay implies there
is such a thing, which pseudo-intellectuals will dismiss as reductive,
though it follows necessarily from the possibility of one essay
being better than another. And thinking about how to do something
so ambitious is close enough to doing it that it holds your attention.<br><br>I like to start an essay with a gleam in my eye. This could be just
a taste of mine, but there's one aspect of it that probably isn't:
to write a really good essay on some topic, you have to be interested
in it. A good writer can write well about anything, but to stretch
for the novel insights that are the raison d'etre of the essay, you
have to care.<br><br>If caring about it is one of the criteria for a good initial question,
then the optimal question varies from person to person. It also
means you're more likely to write great essays if you care about a
lot of different things. The more curious you are, the greater the
probable overlap between the set of things you're curious about and
the set of topics that yield great essays.<br><br>What other qualities would a great initial question have? It's
probably good if it has implications in a lot of different areas.
And I find it's a good sign if it's one that people think has already
been thoroughly explored. But the truth is that I've barely thought
about how to choose initial questions, because I rarely do it. I
rarely <i>choose</i> what to write about; I just start thinking about
something, and sometimes it turns into an essay.<br><br>Am I going to stop writing essays about whatever I happen to be
thinking about and instead start working my way through some
systematically generated list of topics? That doesn't sound like
much fun. And yet I want to write good essays, and if the initial
question matters, I should care about it.<br><br>Perhaps the answer is to go one step earlier: to write about whatever
pops into your head, but try to ensure that what pops into your
head is good. Indeed, now that I think about it, this has to be the
answer, because a mere list of topics wouldn't be any use if you
didn't have edge with any of them. To start writing an essay, you
need a topic plus some initial insight about it, and you can't
generate those systematically. If only. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#dddddd">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>You can probably cause yourself to have more of them, though. The
quality of the ideas that come out of your head depends on what goes
in, and you can improve that in two dimensions, breadth and depth.<br><br>You can't learn everything, so getting breadth implies learning
about topics that are very different from one another. When I tell
people about my book-buying trips to Hay and they ask what I buy
books about, I usually feel a bit sheepish answering, because the
topics seem like a laundry list of unrelated subjects. But perhaps
that's actually optimal in this business.<br><br>You can also get ideas by talking to people, by doing and building
things, and by going places and seeing things. I don't think it's
important to talk to new people so much as the sort of people who
make you have new ideas. I get more new ideas after talking for an
afternoon with Robert Morris than from talking to 20 new smart
people. I know because that's what a block of office hours at Y
Combinator consists of.<br><br>While breadth comes from reading and talking and seeing, depth comes
from doing. The way to really learn about some domain is to have
to solve problems in it. Though this could take the form of writing,
I suspect that to be a good essayist you also have to do, or have
done, some other kind of work. That may not be true for most other
fields, but essay writing is different. You could spend half your
time working on something else and be net ahead, so long as it was
hard.<br><br>I'm not proposing that as a recipe so much as an encouragement to
those already doing it. If you've spent all your life so far working
on other things, you're already halfway there. Though of course to
be good at writing you have to like it, and if you like writing
you'd probably have spent at least some time doing it.<br><br>Everything I've said about initial questions applies also to the
questions you encounter in writing the essay. They're the same
thing; every subtree of an essay is usually a shorter essay, just
as every subtree of a Calder mobile is a smaller mobile. So any
technique that gets you good initial questions also gets you good
whole essays.<br><br>At some point the cycle of question and response reaches what feels
like a natural end. Which is a little suspicious; shouldn't every
answer suggest more questions? I think what happens is that you
start to feel sated. Once you've covered enough interesting ground,
you start to lose your appetite for new questions. Which is just
as well, because the reader is probably feeling sated too. And it's
not lazy to stop asking questions, because you could instead be
asking the initial question of a new essay.<br><br>That's the ultimate source of drag on the connectedness of ideas:
the discoveries you make along the way. If you discover enough
starting from question A, you'll never make it to question B. Though
if you keep writing essays you'll gradually fix this problem by
burning off such discoveries. So bizarrely enough, writing lots of
essays makes it as if the space of ideas were more highly connected.<br><br>When a subtree comes to an end, you can do one of two things. You
can either stop, or pull the Cubist trick of laying separate subtrees
end to end by returning to a question you skipped earlier. Usually
it requires some sleight of hand to make the essay flow continuously
at this point, but not this time. This time I actually need an
example of the phenomenon. For example, we discovered earlier that
the best possible essay wouldn't usually be timeless in the way the
best painting would. This seems surprising enough to be
worth investigating further.<br><br>There are two senses in which an essay can be timeless: to be about
a matter of permanent importance, and always to have the same effect
on readers. With art these two senses blend together. Art that
looked beautiful to the ancient Greeks still looks beautiful to us.
But with essays the two senses diverge, because essays
teach, and you can't teach people something they already know.
Natural selection is certainly a matter of permanent importance,
but an essay explaining it couldn't have the same effect on us that
it would have had on Darwin's contemporaries, precisely because his
ideas were so successful that everyone already knows about them.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#dddddd">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>I imagined when I started writing this that the best possible essay
would be timeless in the stricter, evergreen sense: that it would
contain some deep, timeless wisdom that would appeal equally to
Aristotle and Feynman. That doesn't seem to be true. But if the
best possible essay wouldn't usually be timeless in this stricter
sense, what would it take to write essays that were?<br><br>The answer to that turns out to be very strange: to be the evergreen
kind of timeless, an essay has to be ineffective, in the sense that
its discoveries aren't assimilated into our shared culture. Otherwise
there will be nothing new in it for the second generation of readers.
If you want to surprise readers not just now but in the future as
well, you have to write essays that won't stick — essays that,
no matter how good they are, won't become part of what people in
the future learn before they read them. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#dddddd">11</font></a>]</font><br><br>I can imagine several ways to do that. One would be to write about
things people never learn. For example, it's a long-established
pattern for ambitious people to chase after various types of prizes,
and only later, perhaps too late, to realize that some of them
weren't worth as much as they thought. If you write about that, you
can be confident of a conveyor belt of future readers to be surprised
by it.<br><br>Ditto if you write about the tendency of the inexperienced to overdo
things — of young engineers to produce overcomplicated solutions,
for example. There are some kinds of mistakes people never learn
to avoid except by making them. Any of those should be a timeless
topic.<br><br>Sometimes when we're slow to grasp things it's not just because
we're obtuse or in denial but because we've been deliberately lied
to. There are a lot of things adults <a href="lies.html"><u>lie</u></a> 
to kids about, and when
you reach adulthood, they don't take you aside and hand you a list
of them. They don't remember which lies they told you, and most
were implicit anyway. So contradicting such lies will be a source
of surprises for as long as adults keep telling them.<br><br>Sometimes it's systems that lie to you. For example, the educational
systems in most countries train you to win by 
<a href="lesson.html"><u>hacking the test</u></a>. But
that's not how you win at the most important real-world tests, and
after decades of training, this is hard for new arrivals in the real
world to grasp. Helping them overcome such institutional lies will
work as long as the institutions remain broken. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#dddddd">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>Another recipe for timelessness is to write about things readers
already know, but in much more detail than can be transmitted
culturally. "Everyone knows," for example, that it can be rewarding
to have <a href="kids.html"><u>kids</u></a>. But till you have them you don't know precisely what
forms that takes, and even then much of what you know you may never
have put into words.<br><br>I've written about all these kinds of topics. But I didn't do it
in a deliberate attempt to write essays that were timeless in the
stricter sense. And indeed, the fact that this depends on one's ideas
not sticking suggests that it's not worth making a deliberate attempt
to. You should write about topics of timeless importance, yes, but
if you do such a good job that your conclusions stick and future
generations find your essay obvious instead of novel, so much the
better. You've crossed into Darwin territory.<br><br>Writing about topics of timeless importance is an instance of
something even more general, though: breadth of applicability. And
there are more kinds of breadth than chronological — applying to
lots of different fields, for example. So breadth is the ultimate
aim.<br><br>I already aim for it. Breadth and novelty are the two things I'm
always chasing. But I'm glad I understand where timelessness fits.<br><br>I understand better where a lot of things fit now. This essay has
been a kind of tour of essay writing. I started out hoping to get
advice about topics; if you assume good writing, the only thing
left to differentiate the best essay is its topic. And I did get
advice about topics: discover natural selection. Yeah, that would
be nice. But when you step back and ask what's the best you can do
short of making some great discovery like that, the answer turns
out to be about procedure. Ultimately the quality of an essay is a
function of the ideas discovered in it, and the way you get them
is by casting a wide net for questions and then being very exacting
with the answers.<br><br>The most striking feature of this map of essay writing are the
alternating stripes of inspiration and effort required. The questions
depend on inspiration, but the answers can be got by sheer persistence.
You don't have to get an answer right the first time, but there's
no excuse for not getting it right eventually, because you can keep
rewriting till you do. And this is not just a theoretical possibility.
It's a pretty accurate description of the way I work. I'm rewriting
as we speak.<br><br>But although I wish I could say that writing great essays depends mostly
on effort, in the limit case it's inspiration that makes the
difference. In the limit case, the questions are the harder thing
to get. That pool has no bottom.<br><br>How to get more questions? That is the most important question of
all.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
There might be some resistance to this conclusion on the
grounds that some of these discoveries could only be understood by
a small number of readers. But you get into all sorts of difficulties
if you want to disqualify essays on this account. How do you decide
where the cutoff should be? If a virus kills off everyone except a 
handful of people sequestered at Los Alamos,
could an essay that had been disqualified now be eligible? Etc.<br><br>Darwin's 1844 essay was derived from an earlier version written in 1839.
Extracts from it were published in 1858.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
When you find yourself very curious about an apparently minor
question, that's an exciting sign. Evolution has designed you to
pay attention to things that matter. So when you're very curious
about something random, that could mean you've unconsciously noticed
it's less random than it seems.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Corollary: If you're not intellectually honest, your writing
won't just be biased, but also boring, because you'll miss all the
ideas you'd have discovered if you pushed for the truth.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
Sometimes this process begins before you start writing.
Sometimes you've already figured out the first few things you want
to say. Schoolchildren are often taught they should decide <i>everything</i>
they want to say, and write this down as an outline before they
start writing the essay itself. Maybe that's a good way to get them
started — or not, I don't know — but it's antithetical to the
spirit of essay writing. The more detailed your outline, the less
your ideas can benefit from the sort of discovery that essays are for.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
The problem with this type of "greedy" algorithm is that you
can end up on a local maximum. If the most valuable question is
preceded by a boring one, you'll overlook it. But I can't imagine
a better strategy. There's no lookahead except by writing. So use
a greedy algorithm and a lot of time.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
I ended up reattaching the first 5 of the 17 paragraphs, and
discarding the rest.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Stephen Fry confessed to making use of this phenomenon when
taking exams at Oxford. He had in his head a standard essay about
some general literary topic, and he would find a way to turn the
exam question toward it and then just reproduce it again.<br><br>Strictly speaking it's the graph of ideas that would be highly
connected, not the space, but that usage would confuse people who
don't know graph theory, whereas people who do know it will get
what I mean if I say "space".<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
Too far doesn't depend just on the distance from the original
topic. It's more like that distance divided by the value of whatever
I've discovered in the subtree.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
Or can you? I should try writing about this. Even if the
chance of succeeding is small, the expected value is huge.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
There was a vogue in the 20th century for saying that the
purpose of art was also to teach. Some artists tried to justify
their work by explaining that their goal was not to produce something
good, but to challenge our preconceptions about art. And to be fair,
art can teach somewhat. The ancient Greeks' naturalistic sculptures
represented a new idea, and must have been extra exciting to
contemporaries on that account. But they still look good to us.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
Bertrand Russell caused huge controversy in the early 20th
century with his ideas about "trial marriage." But they make boring
reading now, because they prevailed. "Trial marriage" is what we
call "dating."<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
If you'd asked me 10 years ago, I'd have predicted that schools
would continue to teach hacking the test for centuries. But now it
seems plausible that students will soon be taught individually by
AIs, and that exams will be replaced by ongoing, invisible
micro-assessments.<br><br><br><br><font color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell,

if they might want to start a startup later. Lots of schools think
they should tell students something about startups. This is what I
think they should tell them.)</i><br><br>Most of you probably think that when you're released into the
so-called real world you'll eventually have to get some kind of
job. That's not true, and today I'm going to talk about a trick you
can use to avoid ever having to get a job.<br><br>The trick is to start your own company. So it's not a trick for
avoiding <i>work</i>, because if you start your own company you'll
work harder than you would if you had an ordinary job. But you will
avoid many of the annoying things that come with a job, including
a boss telling you what to do.<br><br>It's more exciting to work on your own project than someone else's.
And you can also get a lot richer. In fact, this is the standard
way to get 
<a href="richnow.html"><u>really rich</u></a>. If you look at the lists of the richest
people that occasionally get published in the press, nearly all of
them did it by starting their own companies.<br><br>Starting your own company can mean anything from starting a barber
shop to starting Google. I'm here to talk about one extreme end of
that continuum. I'm going to tell you how to start Google.<br><br>The companies at the Google end of the continuum are called startups
when they're young. The reason I know about them is that my wife
Jessica and I started something called Y Combinator that is basically
a startup factory. Since 2005, Y Combinator has funded over 4000
startups. So we know exactly what you need to start a startup,
because we've helped people do it for the last 19 years.<br><br>You might have thought I was joking when I said I was going to tell
you how to start Google. You might be thinking "How could <i>we</i>
start Google?" But that's effectively what the people who did start
Google were thinking before they started it. If you'd told Larry
Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google, that the company they
were about to start would one day be worth over a trillion dollars,
their heads would have exploded.<br><br>All you can know when you start working on a startup is that it
seems worth pursuing. You can't know whether it will turn into
a company worth billions or one that goes out of business. So when I
say I'm going to tell you how to start Google, I mean I'm going to
tell you how to get to the point where you can start a company that
has as much chance of being Google as Google had of being Google.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>How do you get from where you are now to the point where you can
start a successful startup? You need three things. You need to be
good at some kind of technology, you need an idea for what you're
going to build, and you need cofounders to start the company with.<br><br>How do you get good at technology? And how do you choose which
technology to get good at? Both of those questions turn out to have
the same answer: work on your own projects. Don't try to guess
whether gene editing or LLMs or rockets will turn out to be the
most valuable technology to know about. No one can predict that.
Just work on whatever interests you the most. You'll work much
harder on something you're interested in than something you're doing
because you think you're supposed to.<br><br>If you're not sure what technology to get good at, get good at
programming. That has been the source of the median startup for the
last 30 years, and this is probably not going to change in the next
10.<br><br>Those of you who are taking computer science classes in school may
at this point be thinking, ok, we've got this sorted. We're already
being taught all about programming. But sorry, this is not enough.
You have to be working on your own projects, not just learning stuff
in classes. You can do well in computer science classes without
ever really learning to program. In fact you can graduate with a
degree in computer science from a top university and still not be
any good at programming. That's why tech companies all make you
take a coding test before they'll hire you, regardless of where you
went to university or how well you did there. They know grades and
exam results prove nothing.<br><br>If you really want to learn to program, you have to work on your
own projects. You learn so much faster that way. Imagine you're
writing a game and there's something you want to do in it, and you
don't know how. You're going to figure out how a lot faster than
you'd learn anything in a class.<br><br>You don't have to learn programming, though. If you're wondering
what counts as technology, it includes practically everything you
could describe using the words "make" or "build." So welding would
count, or making clothes, or making videos. Whatever you're most
interested in. The critical distinction is whether you're producing
or just consuming. Are you writing computer games, or just playing
them? That's the cutoff.<br><br>Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, spent time when he was a teenager
studying calligraphy — the sort of beautiful writing that
you see in medieval manuscripts. No one, including him, thought
that this would help him in his career. He was just doing it because
he was interested in it. But it turned out to help him a lot. The
computer that made Apple really big, the Macintosh, came out at
just the moment when computers got powerful enough to make letters
like the ones in printed books instead of the computery-looking
letters you see in 8 bit games. Apple destroyed everyone else at
this, and one reason was that Steve was one of the few people in
the computer business who really got graphic design.<br><br>Don't feel like your projects have to be <i>serious</i>. They can
be as frivolous as you like, so long as you're building things
you're excited about. Probably 90% of programmers start out building
games. They and their friends like to play games. So they build
the kind of things they and their friends want. And that's exactly
what you should be doing at 15 if you want to start a startup one
day.<br><br>You don't have to do just one project. In fact it's good to learn
about multiple things. Steve Jobs didn't just learn calligraphy.
He also learned about electronics, which was even more valuable.
Whatever you're interested in. (Do you notice a theme here?)<br><br>So that's the first of the three things you need, to get good at
some kind or kinds of technology. You do it the same way you get
good at the violin or football: practice. If you start a startup
at 22, and you start writing your own programs now, then by the
time you start the company you'll have spent at least 7 years
practicing writing code, and you can get pretty good at anything
after practicing it for 7 years.<br><br>Let's suppose you're 22 and you've succeeded: You're now really
good at some technology. How do you get 
<a href="startupideas.html"><u>startup ideas</u></a>? It might
seem like that's the hard part. Even if you are a good programmer,
how do you get the idea to start Google?<br><br>Actually it's easy to get startup ideas once you're good at technology.
Once you're good at some technology, when you look at the world you
see dotted outlines around the things that are missing. You start
to be able to see both the things that are missing from the technology
itself, and all the broken things that could be fixed using it, and
each one of these is a potential startup.<br><br>In the town near our house there's a shop with a sign warning that
the door is hard to close. The sign has been there for several
years. To the people in the shop it must seem like this mysterious
natural phenomenon that the door sticks, and all they can do is put
up a sign warning customers about it. But any carpenter looking at
this situation would think "why don't you just plane off the part
that sticks?"<br><br>Once you're good at programming, all the missing software in the
world starts to become as obvious as a sticking door to a carpenter.
I'll give you a real world example. Back in the 20th century,
American universities used to publish printed directories with all
the students' names and contact info. When I tell you what these
directories were called, you'll know which startup I'm talking
about. They were called facebooks, because they usually had a picture
of each student next to their name.<br><br>So Mark Zuckerberg shows up at Harvard in 2002, and the university
still hasn't gotten the facebook online. Each individual house has
an online facebook, but there isn't one for the whole university.
The university administration has been diligently having meetings
about this, and will probably have solved the problem in another
decade or so. Most of the students don't consciously notice that
anything is wrong. But Mark is a programmer. He looks at this
situation and thinks "Well, this is stupid. I could write a program
to fix this in one night. Just let people upload their own photos
and then combine the data into a new site for the whole university."
So he does. And almost literally overnight he has thousands of
users.<br><br>Of course Facebook was not a startup yet. It was just a... project.
There's that word again. Projects aren't just the best way to learn
about technology. They're also the best source of startup ideas.<br><br>Facebook was not unusual in this respect. Apple and Google also
began as projects. Apple wasn't meant to be a company. Steve Wozniak
just wanted to build his own computer. It only turned into a company
when Steve Jobs said "Hey, I wonder if we could sell plans for this
computer to other people." That's how Apple started. They weren't
even selling computers, just plans for computers. Can you imagine
how lame this company seemed?<br><br>Ditto for Google. Larry and Sergey weren't trying to start a company
at first. They were just trying to make search better. Before Google,
most search engines didn't try to sort the results they gave you
in order of importance. If you searched for "rugby" they just gave
you every web page that contained the word "rugby." And the web was
so small in 1997 that this actually worked! Kind of. There might
only be 20 or 30 pages with the word "rugby," but the web was growing
exponentially, which meant this way of doing search was becoming
exponentially more broken. Most users just thought, "Wow, I sure
have to look through a lot of search results to find what I want."
Door sticks. But like Mark, Larry and Sergey were programmers. Like
Mark, they looked at this situation and thought "Well, this is
stupid. Some pages about rugby matter more than others. Let's figure
out which those are and show them first."<br><br>It's obvious in retrospect that this was a great idea for a startup.
It wasn't obvious at the time. It's never obvious. If it was obviously
a good idea to start Apple or Google or Facebook, someone else would
have already done it. That's why the best startups grow out of
projects that aren't meant to be startups. You're not trying to
start a company. You're just following your instincts about what's
interesting. And if you're young and good at technology, then your
unconscious instincts about what's interesting are better than your
conscious ideas about what would be a good company.<br><br>So it's critical, if you're a young founder, to build things for
yourself and your friends to use. The biggest mistake young founders
make is to build something for some mysterious group of other people.
But if you can make something that you and your friends truly want
to use — something your friends aren't just using out of
loyalty to you, but would be really sad to lose if you shut it down
— then you almost certainly have the germ of a good startup
idea. It may not seem like a startup to you. It may not be obvious
how to make money from it. But trust me, there's a way.<br><br>What you need in a startup idea, and all you need, is something
your friends actually want. And those ideas aren't hard to see once
you're good at technology. There are sticking doors everywhere.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Now for the third and final thing you need: a cofounder, or cofounders.
The optimal startup has two or three founders, so you need one or
two cofounders. How do you find them? Can you predict what I'm going
to say next? It's the same thing: projects. You find cofounders by
working on projects with them. What you need in a cofounder is
someone who's good at what they do and that you work well with, and
the only way to judge this is to work with them on things.<br><br>At this point I'm going to tell you something you might not want
to hear. It really matters to do well in your classes, even the
ones that are just memorization or blathering about literature,
because you need to do well in your classes to get into a good
university. And if you want to start a startup you should try to
get into the best university you can, because that's where the best
cofounders are. It's also where the best employees are. When Larry
and Sergey started Google, they began by just hiring all the smartest
people they knew out of Stanford, and this was a real advantage for
them.<br><br>The empirical evidence is clear on this. If you look at where the
largest numbers of successful startups come from, it's pretty much
the same as the list of the most selective universities.<br><br>I don't think it's the prestigious names of these universities that
cause more good startups to come out of them. Nor do I think it's
because the quality of the teaching is better. What's driving this
is simply the difficulty of getting in. You have to be pretty smart
and determined to get into MIT or Cambridge, so if you do manage
to get in, you'll find the other students include a lot of smart
and determined people.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>You don't have to start a startup with someone you meet at university.
The founders of Twitch met when they were seven. The founders of
Stripe, Patrick and John Collison, met when John was born. But
universities are the main source of cofounders. And because they're
where the cofounders are, they're also where the ideas are, because
the best ideas grow out of projects you do with the people who
become your cofounders.<br><br>So the list of what you need to do to get from here to starting a
startup is quite short. You need to get good at technology, and the
way to do that is to work on your own projects. And you need to do
as well in school as you can, so you can get into a good university,
because that's where the cofounders and the ideas are.<br><br>That's it, just two things, build stuff and do well in school.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
The rhetorical trick in this sentence is that the "Google"s
refer to different things. What I mean is: a company that has as
much chance of growing as big as Google ultimately did as Larry and
Sergey could have reasonably expected Google itself would at the
time they started it. But I think the original version is zippier.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Making something for your friends isn't the only source of
startup ideas. It's just the best source for young founders, who
have the least knowledge of what other people want, and whose own
wants are most predictive of future demand.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
Strangely enough this is particularly true in countries like
the US where undergraduate admissions are done badly. US admissions
departments make applicants jump through a lot of arbitrary hoops
that have little to do with their intellectual ability. But the
more arbitrary a test, the more it becomes a test of mere determination
and resourcefulness. And those are the two most important qualities
in startup founders. So US admissions departments are better at
selecting founders than they would be if they were better at selecting
students.<br><br><br><br><font color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Jared Friedman, Carolynn Levy, Jessica Livingston, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of this.</font><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

In fact they
were one of the reasons we started it.<br><br>YC grew out of a talk I gave to the Harvard Computer Society (the
undergrad computer club) about how to start a startup. Everyone
else in the audience was probably local, but Steve and Alexis came
up on the train from the University of Virginia, where they were
seniors. Since they'd come so far I agreed to meet them for coffee.
They told me about the startup idea we'd later fund them to drop:
a way to order fast food on your cellphone.<br><br>This was before smartphones. They'd have had to make deals with
cell carriers and fast food chains just to get it launched. So it
was not going to happen. It still doesn't exist, 19 years later.
But I was impressed with their brains and their energy. In fact I
was so impressed with them and some of the other people I met at
that talk that I decided to start something to fund them. A few
days later I told Steve and Alexis that we were starting Y&nbsp;Combinator,
and encouraged them to apply.<br><br>That first batch we didn't have any way to identify applicants, so
we made up nicknames for them. The Reddits were the "Cell food
muffins." "Muffin" is a term of endearment Jessica uses for things
like small dogs and two year olds. So that gives you some idea what
kind of impression Steve and Alexis made in those days. They had
the look of slightly ruffled surprise that baby birds have.<br><br>Their idea was bad though. And since we thought then that we were
funding ideas rather than founders, we rejected them. But we felt
bad about it. Jessica was sad that we'd rejected the muffins. And
it seemed wrong to me to turn down the people we'd been inspired
to start YC to fund.<br><br>I don't think the startup sense of the word "pivot" had been invented
yet, but we wanted to fund Steve and Alexis, so if their idea was
bad, they'd have to work on something else. And I knew what else.
In those days there was a site called Delicious where you could
save links. It had a page called del.icio.us/popular that listed
the most-saved links, and people were using this page as a de facto
Reddit. I knew because a lot of the traffic to my site was coming
from it. There needed to be something like del.icio.us/popular, but
designed for sharing links instead of being a byproduct of saving
them.<br><br>So I called Steve and Alexis and said that we liked them, just not
their idea, so we'd fund them if they'd work on something else.
They were on the train home to Virginia at that point. They got off
at the next station and got on the next train north, and by the end
of the day were committed to working on what's now called Reddit.<br><br>They would have liked to call it Snoo, as in "What snoo?" But
snoo.com was too expensive, so they settled for calling the mascot
Snoo and picked a name for the site that wasn't registered. Early
on Reddit was just a provisional name, or so they told me at least,
but it's probably too late to change it now.<br><br>As with all the really great startups, there's an uncannily close
match between the company and the founders. Steve in particular.
Reddit has a certain personality — curious, skeptical, ready to
be amused — and that personality is Steve's.<br><br>Steve will roll his eyes at this, but he's an intellectual; he's
interested in ideas for their own sake. That was how he came to be
in that audience in Cambridge in the first place. He knew me because
he was interested in a programming language I've written about
called Lisp, and Lisp is one of those languages few people learn
except out of intellectual curiosity. Steve's kind of vacuum-cleaner
curiosity is exactly what you want when you're starting a site
that's a list of links to literally anything interesting.<br><br>Steve was not a big fan of authority, so he also liked the idea of
a site without editors. In those days the top forum for programmers
was a site called Slashdot. It was a lot like Reddit, except the
stories on the frontpage were chosen by human moderators. And though
they did a good job, that one small difference turned out to be a
big difference. Being driven by user submissions meant Reddit was
fresher than Slashdot. News there was newer, and users will always
go where the newest news is.<br><br>I pushed the Reddits to launch fast. A version one didn't need to
be more than a couple hundred lines of code. How could that take
more than a week or two to build? And they did launch comparatively
fast, about three weeks into the first YC batch. The first users
were Steve, Alexis, me, and some of their YC batchmates and college
friends. It turns out you don't need that many users to collect a
decent list of interesting links, especially if you have multiple
accounts per user.<br><br>Reddit got two more people from their YC batch: Chris Slowe and
Aaron Swartz, and they too were unusually smart. Chris was just
finishing his PhD in physics at Harvard. Aaron was younger, a college
freshman, and even more anti-authority than Steve. It's not
exaggerating to describe him as a martyr for what authority later
did to him.<br><br>Slowly but inexorably Reddit's traffic grew. At first the numbers
were so small they were hard to distinguish from background noise.
But within a few weeks it was clear that there was a core of real
users returning regularly to the site. And although all kinds of
things have happened to Reddit the company in the years since,
Reddit the <i>site</i> never looked back.<br><br>Reddit the site (and now app) is such a fundamentally useful thing
that it's almost unkillable. Which is why, despite a long stretch
after Steve left when the management strategy ranged from benign
neglect to spectacular blunders, traffic just kept growing. You
can't do that with most companies. Most companies you take your eye
off the ball for six months and you're in deep trouble. But Reddit
was special, and when Steve came back in 2015, I knew the world was
in for a surprise.<br><br>People thought they had Reddit's number: one of the players in
Silicon Valley, but not one of the big ones. But those who knew
what had been going on behind the scenes knew there was more to the
story than this. If Reddit could grow to the size it had with
management that was harmless at best, what could it do if Steve
came back? We now know the answer to that question. Or at least a
lower bound on the answer. Steve is not out of ideas yet.<br><br><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div><div><font size="2" face="verdana"><br><br></font></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div>

New ideas often don't work
at first, but they're not deterred. They keep trying and eventually
find something that does.<br><br>Mere obstinacy, on the other hand, is a recipe for failure. Obstinate
people are so annoying. They won't listen. They beat their heads
against a wall and get nowhere.<br><br>But is there any real difference between these two cases? Are
persistent and obstinate people actually behaving differently? Or
are they doing the same thing, and we just label them later as
persistent or obstinate depending on whether they turned out to be
right or not?<br><br>If that's the only difference then there's nothing to be learned
from the distinction. Telling someone to be persistent rather than
obstinate would just be telling them to be right rather than wrong,
and they already know that. Whereas if persistence and obstinacy
are actually different kinds of behavior, it would be worthwhile
to tease them apart.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>I've talked to a lot of determined people, and it seems to me that
they're different kinds of behavior. I've often walked away from a
conversation thinking either "Wow, that guy is determined" or "Damn,
that guy is stubborn," and I don't think I'm just talking about
whether they seemed right or not. That's part of it, but not all
of it.<br><br>There's something annoying about the obstinate that's not simply
due to being mistaken. They won't listen. And that's not true of
all determined people. I can't think of anyone more determined than
the Collison brothers, and when you point out a problem to them,
they not only listen, but listen with an almost predatory intensity.
Is there a hole in the bottom of their boat? Probably not, but if
there is, they want to know about it.<br><br>It's the same with most successful people. They're never <i>more</i>
engaged than when you disagree with them. Whereas the obstinate
don't want to hear you. When you point out problems, their eyes
glaze over, and their replies sound like ideologues talking about
matters of doctrine.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The reason the persistent and the obstinate seem similar is that
they're both hard to stop. But they're hard to stop in different
senses. The persistent are like boats whose engines can't be throttled
back. The obstinate are like boats whose rudders can't be turned.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>In the degenerate case they're indistinguishable: when there's only
one way to solve a problem, your only choice is whether to give up
or not, and persistence and obstinacy both say no. This is presumably
why the two are so often conflated in popular culture. It assumes
simple problems. But as problems get more complicated, we can see
the difference between them. The persistent are much more attached
to points high in the decision tree than to minor ones lower down,
while the obstinate spray "don't give up" indiscriminately over the
whole tree.<br><br>The persistent are attached to the goal. The obstinate are attached
to their ideas about how to reach it.<br><br>Worse still, that means they'll tend to be attached to their <i>first</i>
ideas about how to solve a problem, even though these are the least
informed by the experience of working on it. So the obstinate aren't
merely attached to details, but disproportionately likely to be
attached to wrong ones.<br><br><br><br>Why are they like this? Why are the obstinate obstinate? One
possibility is that they're overwhelmed. They're not very capable.
They take on a hard problem. They're immediately in over their head.
So they grab onto ideas the way someone on the deck of a rolling
ship might grab onto the nearest handhold.<br><br>That was my initial theory, but on examination it doesn't hold up.
If being obstinate were simply a consequence of being in over one's
head, you could make persistent people become obstinate by making
them solve harder problems. But that's not what happens. If you
handed the Collisons an extremely hard problem to solve, they
wouldn't become obstinate. If anything they'd become less obstinate.
They'd know they had to be open to anything.<br><br>Similarly, if obstinacy were caused by the situation, the obstinate
would stop being obstinate when solving easier problems. But they
don't. And if obstinacy isn't caused by the situation, it must come
from within. It must be a feature of one's personality.<br><br>Obstinacy is a reflexive resistance to changing one's ideas. This
is not identical with stupidity, but they're closely related. A
reflexive resistance to changing one's ideas becomes a sort of
induced stupidity as contrary evidence mounts. And obstinacy is a
form of not giving up that's easily practiced by the stupid. You
don't have to consider complicated tradeoffs; you just dig in your
heels. It even works, up to a point.<br><br>The fact that obstinacy works for simple problems is an important
clue. Persistence and obstinacy aren't opposites. The relationship
between them is more like the relationship between the two kinds
of respiration we can do: aerobic respiration, and the anaerobic
respiration we inherited from our most distant ancestors. Anaerobic
respiration is a more primitive process, but it has its uses. When
you leap suddenly away from a threat, that's what you're using.<br><br>The optimal amount of obstinacy is not zero. It can be good if your
initial reaction to a setback is an unthinking "I won't give up,"
because this helps prevent panic. But unthinking only gets you so
far. The further someone is toward the obstinate end of the continuum,
the less likely they are to succeed in solving hard problems.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><br><br>Obstinacy is a simple thing. Animals have it. But persistence turns
out to have a fairly complicated internal structure.<br><br>One thing that distinguishes the persistent is their energy. At the
risk of putting too much weight on words, they persist rather than
merely resisting. They keep trying things. Which means the persistent
must also be imaginative. To keep trying things, you have to keep
thinking of things to try.<br><br>Energy and imagination make a wonderful combination. Each gets the
best out of the other. Energy creates demand for the ideas produced
by imagination, which thus produces more, and imagination gives
energy somewhere to go.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#dddddd">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Merely having energy and imagination is quite rare. But to solve
hard problems you need three more qualities: resilience, good
judgement, and a focus on some kind of goal.<br><br>Resilience means not having one's morale destroyed by setbacks.
Setbacks are inevitable once problems reach a certain size, so if
you can't bounce back from them, you can only do good work on a
small scale. But resilience is not the same as obstinacy. Resilience
means setbacks can't change your morale, not that they can't change
your mind.<br><br>Indeed, persistence often requires that one change one's mind.
That's where good judgement comes in. The persistent are quite
rational. They focus on expected value. It's this, not recklessness,
that lets them work on things that are unlikely to succeed.<br><br>There is one point at which the persistent are often irrational
though: at the very top of the decision tree. When they choose
between two problems of roughly equal expected value, the choice
usually comes down to personal preference. Indeed, they'll often
classify projects into deliberately wide bands of expected value
in order to ensure that the one they want to work on still qualifies.<br><br>Empirically this doesn't seem to be a problem. It's ok to be
irrational near the top of the decision tree. One reason is that
we humans will work harder on a problem we love. But there's another
more subtle factor involved as well: our preferences among problems
aren't random. When we love a problem that other people don't, it's
often because we've unconsciously noticed that it's more important
than they realize.<br><br>Which leads to our fifth quality: there needs to be some overall
goal. If you're like me you began, as a kid, merely with the desire
to do something great. In theory that should be the most powerful
motivator of all, since it includes everything that could possibly
be done. But in practice it's not much use, precisely because it
includes too much. It doesn't tell you what to do at this moment.<br><br>So in practice your energy and imagination and resilience and good
judgement have to be directed toward some fairly specific goal. Not
too specific, or you might miss a great discovery adjacent to what
you're searching for, but not too general, or it won't work to
motivate you.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#dddddd">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>When you look at the internal structure of persistence, it doesn't
resemble obstinacy at all. It's so much more complex. Five distinct
qualities — energy, imagination, resilience, good judgement, and
focus on a goal — combine to produce a phenomenon that seems a bit
like obstinacy in the sense that it causes you not to give up. But
the way you don't give up is completely different. Instead of merely
resisting change, you're driven toward a goal by energy and resilience,
through paths discovered by imagination and optimized by judgement.
You'll give way on any point low down in the decision tree, if its
expected value drops sufficiently, but energy and resilience keep
pushing you toward whatever you chose higher up.<br><br>Considering what it's made of, it's not surprising that the right
kind of stubbornness is so much rarer than the wrong kind, or that
it gets so much better results. Anyone can do obstinacy. Indeed,
kids and drunks and fools are best at it. Whereas very few people
have enough of all five of the qualities that produce the right kind
of stubbornness, but when they do the results are magical.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
I'm going to use "persistent" for the good kind of stubborn
and "obstinate" for the bad kind, but I can't claim I'm simply
following current usage. Conventional opinion barely distinguishes
between good and bad kinds of stubbornness, and usage is correspondingly
promiscuous. I could have invented a new word for the good kind,
but it seemed better just to stretch "persistent."<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
There are some domains where one can succeed by being obstinate.
Some political leaders have been notorious for it. But it won't
work in situations where you have to pass external tests. And indeed
the political leaders who are famous for being obstinate are famous
for getting power, not for using it well.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
There will be some resistance to turning the rudder of a
persistent person, because there's some cost to changing direction.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
The obstinate do sometimes succeed in solving hard problems.
One way is through luck: like the stopped clock that's right twice
a day, they seize onto some arbitrary idea, and it turns out to be
right. Another is when their obstinacy cancels out some other form
of error. For example, if a leader has overcautious subordinates,
their estimates of the probability of success will always be off
in the same direction. So if he mindlessly says "push ahead regardless"
in every borderline case, he'll usually turn out to be right.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
If you stop there, at just energy and imagination, you get
the conventional caricature of an artist or poet.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Start by erring on the small side. If you're inexperienced
you'll inevitably err on one side or the other, and if you err on
the side of making the goal too broad, you won't get anywhere.
Whereas if you err on the small side you'll at least be moving
forward. Then, once you're moving, you expand the goal.<br><br><br><br><font color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell,

was there will remember. Most founders I talked to afterward said
it was the best they'd ever heard. Ron Conway, for the first time
in his life, forgot to take notes. I'm not going to try to reproduce
it here. Instead I want to talk about a question it raised.<br><br>The theme of Brian's talk was that the conventional wisdom about
how to run larger companies is mistaken. As Airbnb grew, well-meaning
people advised him that he had to run the company in a certain way
for it to scale. Their advice could be optimistically summarized
as "hire good people and give them room to do their jobs." He
followed this advice and the results were disastrous. So he had to
figure out a better way on his own, which he did partly by studying
how Steve Jobs ran Apple. So far it seems to be working. Airbnb's
free cash flow margin is now among the best in Silicon Valley.<br><br>The audience at this event included a lot of the most successful
founders we've funded, and one after another said that the same
thing had happened to them. They'd been given the same advice about
how to run their companies as they grew, but instead of helping
their companies, it had damaged them.<br><br>Why was everyone telling these founders the wrong thing? That was
the big mystery to me. And after mulling it over for a bit I figured
out the answer: what they were being told was how to run a company
you hadn't founded — how to run a company if you're merely a
professional manager. But this m.o. is so much less effective that
to founders it feels broken. There are things founders can do that
managers can't, and not doing them feels wrong to founders, because
it is.<br><br>In effect there are two different ways to run a company: founder
mode and manager mode. Till now most people even in Silicon Valley
have implicitly assumed that scaling a startup meant switching to
manager mode. But we can infer the existence of another mode from
the dismay of founders who've tried it, and the success of their
attempts to escape from it.<br><br>There are as far as I know no books specifically about founder mode.
Business schools don't know it exists. All we have so far are the
experiments of individual founders who've been figuring it out for
themselves. But now that we know what we're looking for, we can
search for it. I hope in a few years founder mode will be as well
understood as manager mode. We can already guess at some of the
ways it will differ.<br><br>The way managers are taught to run companies seems to be like modular
design in the sense that you treat subtrees of the org chart as
black boxes. You tell your direct reports what to do, and it's up
to them to figure out how. But you don't get involved in the details
of what they do. That would be micromanaging them, which is bad.<br><br>Hire good people and give them room to do their jobs. Sounds great
when it's described that way, doesn't it? Except in practice, judging
from the report of founder after founder, what this often turns out
to mean is: hire professional fakers and let them drive the company
into the ground.<br><br>One theme I noticed both in Brian's talk and when talking to founders
afterward was the idea of being gaslit. Founders feel like they're
being gaslit from both sides — by the people telling them they
have to run their companies like managers, and by the people working
for them when they do. Usually when everyone around you disagrees
with you, your default assumption should be that you're mistaken.
But this is one of the rare exceptions. VCs who haven't been founders
themselves don't know how founders should run companies, and C-level
execs, as a class, include some of the most skillful liars in the
world.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Whatever founder mode consists of, it's pretty clear that it's going
to break the principle that the CEO should engage with the company
only via his or her direct reports. "Skip-level" meetings will
become the norm instead of a practice so unusual that there's a
name for it. And once you abandon that constraint there are a huge
number of permutations to choose from.<br><br>For example, Steve Jobs used to run an annual retreat for what he
considered the 100 most important people at Apple, and these were
not the 100 people highest on the org chart. Can you imagine the
force of will it would take to do this at the average company? And
yet imagine how useful such a thing could be. It could make a big
company feel like a startup. Steve presumably wouldn't have kept
having these retreats if they didn't work. But I've never heard of
another company doing this. So is it a good idea, or a bad one? We
still don't know. That's how little we know about founder mode.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>Obviously founders can't keep running a 2000 person company the way
they ran it when it had 20. There's going to have to be some amount
of delegation. Where the borders of autonomy end up, and how sharp
they are, will probably vary from company to company. They'll even
vary from time to time within the same company, as managers earn
trust. So founder mode will be more complicated than manager mode.
But it will also work better. We already know that from the examples
of individual founders groping their way toward it.<br><br>Indeed, another prediction I'll make about founder mode is that
once we figure out what it is, we'll find that a number of individual
founders were already most of the way there — except that in doing
what they did they were regarded by many as eccentric or worse.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Curiously enough it's an encouraging thought that we still know so
little about founder mode. Look at what founders have achieved
already, and yet they've achieved this against a headwind of bad
advice. Imagine what they'll do once we can tell them how to run
their companies like Steve Jobs instead of John Sculley.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
The more diplomatic way of phrasing this statement would be
to say that experienced C-level execs are often very skilled at
managing up. And I don't think anyone with knowledge of this world
would dispute that.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
If the practice of having such retreats became so widespread
that even mature companies dominated by politics started to do it,
we could quantify the senescence of companies by the average depth
on the org chart of those invited.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
I also have another less optimistic prediction: as soon as
the concept of founder mode becomes established, people will start
misusing it. Founders who are unable to delegate even things they
should will use founder mode as the excuse. Or managers who aren't
founders will decide they should try to act like founders. That may
even work, to some extent, but the results will be messy when it
doesn't; the modular approach does at least limit the damage a bad
CEO can do.<br><br><br><br><font color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Brian Chesky, Patrick Collison,

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><div><div><div></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></div><div><br><br><div><h1 id="when">When To Do What You Love</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">September 2024<br><br>There's some debate about whether it's a good idea to "follow your
passion." In fact the question is impossible to answer with a simple
yes or no. Sometimes you should and sometimes you shouldn't, but
the border between should and shouldn't is very complicated. The
only way to give a general answer is to trace it.<br><br>When people talk about this question, there's always an implicit
"instead of." All other things being equal, why wouldn't you work
on what interests you the most? So even raising the question implies
that all other things aren't equal, and that you have to choose
between working on what interests you the most and something else,
like what pays the best.<br><br>And indeed if your main goal is to make money, you can't usually
afford to work on what interests you the most. People pay you for
doing what they want, not what you want. But there's an obvious
exception: when you both want the same thing. For example, if you
love football, and you're good enough at it, you can get paid a lot
to play it.<br><br>Of course the odds are against you in a case like football, because
so many other people like playing it too. This is not to say you
shouldn't try though. It depends how much ability you have and how
hard you're willing to work.<br><br>The odds are better when you have strange tastes: when you like
something that pays well and that few other people like. For example,
it's clear that Bill Gates truly loved running a software company.
He didn't just love programming, which a lot of people do. He loved
writing software for customers. That is a very strange taste indeed,
but if you have it, you can make a lot by indulging it.<br><br>There are even some people who have a genuine intellectual interest
in making money. This is distinct from mere greed. They just can't
help noticing when something is mispriced, and can't help doing
something about it. It's like a puzzle for them.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>In fact there's an edge case here so spectacular that it turns all
the preceding advice on its head. If you want to make a really 
huge
amount of money — hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars
— it turns out to be very useful to work on what interests you the
most. The reason is not the extra motivation you get from doing
this, but that the way to make a really large amount of money is
to start a startup, and working on what interests you is an excellent
way to discover <a href="startupideas.html"><u>startup ideas</u></a>.<br><br>Many if not most of the biggest startups began as projects the
founders were doing for fun. Apple, Google, and Facebook all began
that way. Why is this pattern so common? Because the best ideas
tend to be such outliers that you'd overlook them if you were
consciously looking for ways to make money. Whereas if you're young
and good at technology, your unconscious instincts about what would
be interesting to work on are very well aligned with what needs to
be built.<br><br>So there's something like a midwit peak for making money. If you
don't need to make much, you can work on whatever you're most
interested in; if you want to become moderately rich, you can't
usually afford to; but if you want to become super rich, and you're
young and good at technology, working on what you're most interested
in becomes a good idea again.<br><br>What if you're not sure what you want? What if you're attracted to
the idea of making money and more attracted to some kinds of work
than others, but neither attraction predominates? How do you break
ties?<br><br>The key here is to understand that such ties are only apparent.
When you have trouble choosing between following your interests and
making money, it's never because you have complete knowledge of
yourself and of the types of work you're choosing between, and the
options are perfectly balanced. When you can't decide which path
to take, it's almost always due to ignorance. In fact you're usually
suffering from three kinds of ignorance simultaneously: you don't
know what makes you happy, what the various kinds of work are really
like, or how well you could do them. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>In a way this ignorance is excusable. It's often hard to predict
these things, and no one even tells you that you need to. If you're
ambitious you're told you should go to college, and this is good
advice so far as it goes, but that's where it usually ends. No one
tells you how to figure out what to work on, or how hard this can
be.<br><br>What do you do in the face of uncertainty? Get more certainty. And
probably the best way to do that is to try working on things you're
interested in. That will get you more information about how interested
you are in them, how good you are at them, and how much scope they
offer for ambition.<br><br>Don't wait. Don't wait till the end of college to figure out what
to work on. Don't even wait for internships during college. You
don't necessarily need a job doing x in order to work on x; often
you can just start doing it in some form yourself. And since figuring
out what to work on is a problem that could take years to solve,
the sooner you start, the better.<br><br>One useful trick for judging different kinds of work is to look at
who your colleagues will be. You'll become like whoever you work
with. Do you want to become like these people?<br><br>Indeed, the difference in character between different kinds of work
is magnified by the fact that everyone else is facing the same
decisions as you. If you choose a kind of work mainly for how well
it pays, you'll be surrounded by other people who chose it for the
same reason, and that will make it even more soul-sucking than it
seems from the outside. Whereas if you choose work you're genuinely
interested in, you'll be surrounded mostly by other people who are
genuinely interested in it, and that will make it extra inspiring.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The other thing you do in the face of uncertainty is to make choices
that are uncertainty-proof. The less sure you are about what to do,
the more important it is to choose options that give you more options
in the future. I call this "staying upwind." If you're unsure whether
to major in math or economics, for example, choose math; math is
upwind of economics in the sense that it will be easier to switch
later from math to economics than from economics to math.<br><br>There's one case, though, where it's easy to say whether you should
work on what interests you the most: if you want to do 
<a href="greatwork.html"><u>great work</u></a>.
This is not a sufficient condition for doing great work, but it is
a necessary one.<br><br>There's a lot of selection bias in advice about whether to "follow
your passion," and this is the reason. Most such advice comes from
people who are famously successful, and if you ask someone who's
famously successful how to do what they did, most will tell you
that you have to work on what you're most interested in. And this
is in fact true.<br><br>That doesn't mean it's the right advice for everyone. Not everyone
can do great work, or wants to. But if you do want to, the complicated
question of whether or not to work on what interests you the most
becomes simple. The answer is yes. The root of great work is a sort
of ambitious curiosity, and you can't manufacture that.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
These examples show why it's a mistake to assume that economic
inequality must be evidence of some kind of brokenness or unfairness.
It's obvious that different people have different interests, and
that some interests yield far more money than others, so how can
it not be obvious that some people will end up much richer than
others? In a world where some people like to write enterprise
software and others like to make studio pottery, economic inequality
is the natural outcome.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Difficulty choosing between interests is a different matter.
That's not always due to ignorance. It's often intrinsically
difficult. I still have trouble doing it.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
You can't always take people at their word on this. Since
it's more prestigious to work on things you're interested in than
to be driven by money, people who are driven mainly by money will
often claim to be more interested in their work than they actually
are. One way to test such claims is by doing the following thought
experiment: if their work didn't pay well, would they take day jobs
doing something else in order to do it in their spare time? Lots
of mathematicians and scientists and engineers would. Historically
lots <i>have</i>. But I don't think as many investment bankers would.<br><br>This thought experiment is also useful for distinguishing between
university departments.<br><br><br><br><font color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit,

feel fairly confident about this one: in a couple decades there
won't be many people who can write.<br><br>One of the strangest things you learn if you're a writer is how
many people have trouble writing. Doctors know how many people have
a mole they're worried about; people who are good at setting up
computers know how many people aren't; writers know how many people
need help writing.<br><br>The reason so many people have trouble writing is that it's
fundamentally difficult. To write well you have to think clearly,
and thinking clearly is hard.<br><br>And yet writing pervades many jobs, and the more prestigious the
job, the more writing it tends to require.<br><br>These two powerful opposing forces, the pervasive expectation of
writing and the irreducible difficulty of doing it, create enormous
pressure. This is why eminent professors often turn out to have
resorted to plagiarism. The most striking thing to me about these
cases is the pettiness of the thefts. The stuff they steal is usually
the most mundane boilerplate — the sort of thing that anyone who
was even halfway decent at writing could turn out with no effort
at all. Which means they're not even halfway decent at writing.<br><br>Till recently there was no convenient escape valve for the pressure
created by these opposing forces. You could pay someone to write
for you, like JFK, or plagiarize, like MLK, but if you couldn't buy
or steal words, you had to write them yourself. And as a result
nearly everyone who was expected to write had to learn how.<br><br>Not anymore. AI has blown this world open. Almost all pressure to
write has dissipated. You can have AI do it for you, both in school
and at work.<br><br>The result will be a world divided into writes and write-nots.
There will still be some people who can write. Some of us like it.
But the middle ground between those who are good at writing and
those who can't write at all will disappear. Instead of good writers,
ok writers, and people who can't write, there will just be good
writers and people who can't write.<br><br>Is that so bad? Isn't it common for skills to disappear when
technology makes them obsolete? There aren't many blacksmiths left,
and it doesn't seem to be a problem.<br><br>Yes, it's bad. The reason is something I mentioned earlier: writing
is thinking. In fact there's a kind of thinking that can only be
done by writing. You can't make this point better than Leslie Lamport
did:
<blockquote>
  If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking.
</blockquote>
So a world divided into writes and write-nots is more dangerous
than it sounds. It will be a world of thinks and think-nots. I know
which half I want to be in, and I bet you do too.<br><br>This situation is not unprecedented. In preindustrial times most
people's jobs made them strong. Now if you want to be strong, you
work out. So there are still strong people, but only those who
choose to be.<br><br>It will be the same with writing. There will still be smart people,
but only those who choose to be.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><font color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston, Ben Miller,

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><div><div><div></div><div><img src="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ca/Img/trans_1x1.gif" height="1" width="26" border="0"></div><div><br><br><div><h1 id="woke">The Origins of Wokeness</h1><br><br><font size="2" face="verdana">January 2025<br><br>The word "prig" isn't very common now, but if you look up
the definition, it will sound familiar. Google's isn't bad:
<blockquote>
  A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if
  superior to others.
</blockquote>
This sense of the word originated in the 18th century, and
its age is an important clue: it shows that although
wokeness is a comparatively recent phenomenon, it's an
instance of a much older one.<br><br>There's a certain kind of person who's attracted to a
shallow, exacting kind of moral purity, and who demonstrates
his purity by attacking anyone who breaks the rules. Every
society has these people. All that changes is the rules they
enforce. In Victorian England it was Christian virtue. In
Stalin's Russia it was orthodox Marxism-Leninism. For the
woke, it's social justice.<br><br>So if you want to understand wokeness, the question to ask
is not why people behave this way. Every society has prigs.
The question to ask is why our prigs are priggish about
these ideas, at this moment. And to answer that we have to
ask when and where wokeness began.<br><br>The answer to the first question is the 1980s. Wokeness is a
second, more aggressive wave of political correctness, which
started in the late 1980s, died down in the late 1990s, and
then returned with a vengeance in the early 2010s, finally
peaking after the riots of 2020.<br><br>This was not the original meaning of "woke," but it's rarely
used in the original sense now. Now the pejorative sense is
the dominant one. What <i>does</i> it mean now? I've often been
asked to define both wokeness and political correctness by
people who think they're meaningless labels, so I will. They
both have the same definition:
<blockquote>
  An aggressively performative focus on social justice.
</blockquote>
In other words, it's people being prigs about social
justice. And that's the real problem — the
performativeness, not the social justice.<br><br>Racism, for example, is a genuine problem. Not a problem on
the scale that the woke believe it to be, but a genuine one.
I don't think any reasonable person would deny that. The
problem with political correctness was not that it focused
on marginalized groups, but the shallow, aggressive way in
which it did so. Instead of going out into the world and
quietly helping members of marginalized groups, the
politically correct focused on getting people in trouble for
using the wrong words to talk about them.<br><br>As for where political correctness began, if you think about
it, you probably already know the answer. Did it begin
outside universities and spread to them from this external
source? Obviously not; it has always been most extreme in
universities. So where in universities did it begin? Did it
begin in math, or the hard sciences, or engineering, and
spread from there to the humanities and social sciences?
Those are amusing images, but no, obviously it began in the
humanities and social sciences.<br><br>Why there? And why then? What happened in the humanities and
social sciences in the 1980s?<br><br>A successful theory of the origin of political correctness
has to be able to explain why it didn't happen earlier. Why
didn't it happen during the protest movements of the 1960s,
for example? They were concerned with much the same issues.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>The reason the student protests of the 1960s didn't lead to
political correctness was precisely that — they were
student movements. They didn't have any real power. The
students may have been talking a lot about women's
liberation and black power, but it was not what they were
being taught in their classes. Not yet.<br><br>But in the early 1970s the student protestors of the 1960s
began to finish their dissertations and get hired as
professors. At first they were neither powerful nor
numerous. But as more of their peers joined them and the
previous generation of professors started to retire, they
gradually became both.<br><br>The reason political correctness began in the humanities and
social sciences was that these fields offered more scope for
the injection of politics. A 1960s radical who got a job as
a physics professor could still attend protests, but his
political beliefs wouldn't affect his work. Whereas research
in sociology and modern literature can be made as political
as you like.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>I saw political correctness arise. When I started college in
1982 it was not yet a thing. Female students might object if
someone said something they considered sexist, but no one
was getting <i>reported</i> for it. It was still not a thing when
I started grad school in 1986. It was definitely a thing in
1988 though, and by the early 1990s it seemed to pervade
campus life.<br><br>What happened? How did protest become punishment? Why were
the late 1980s the point at which protests against male
chauvinism (as it used to be called) morphed into formal
complaints to university authorities about sexism?
Basically, the 1960s radicals got tenure. They became the
Establishment they'd protested against two decades before.
Now they were in a position not just to speak out about
their ideas, but to enforce them.<br><br>A new set of moral rules to enforce was exciting news to a
certain kind of student. What made it particularly exciting
was that they were allowed to attack professors. I remember
noticing that aspect of political correctness at the time.
It wasn't simply a grass-roots student movement. It was
faculty members encouraging students to attack other faculty
members. In that respect it was like the Cultural
Revolution. That wasn't a grass-roots movement either; that
was Mao unleashing the younger generation on his political
opponents. And in fact when Roderick MacFarquhar started
teaching a class on the Cultural Revolution at Harvard in
the late 1980s, many saw it as a comment on current events.
I don't know if it actually was, but people thought it was,
and that means the similarities were obvious.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#dddddd">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>College students larp. It's their nature. It's usually
harmless. But larping morality turned out to be a poisonous
combination. The result was a kind of moral etiquette,
superficial but very complicated. Imagine having to explain
to a well-meaning visitor from another planet why using the
phrase "people of color" is considered particularly
enlightened, but saying "colored people" gets you fired. And
why exactly one isn't supposed to use the word "negro" now,
even though Martin Luther King used it constantly in his
speeches. There are no underlying principles. You'd just
have to give him a long list of rules to memorize.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#dddddd">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>
The danger of these rules was not just that they created
land mines for the unwary, but that their elaborateness made
them an effective substitute for virtue. Whenever a society
has a concept of heresy and orthodoxy, orthodoxy becomes a
substitute for virtue. You can be the worst person in the
world, but as long as you're orthodox you're better than
everyone who isn't. This makes orthodoxy very attractive to
bad people.<br><br>But for it to work as a substitute for virtue, orthodoxy
must be difficult. If all you have to do to be orthodox is
wear some garment or avoid saying some word, everyone knows
to do it, and the only way to seem more virtuous than other
people is to actually be virtuous. The shallow, complicated,
and frequently changing rules of political correctness made
it the perfect substitute for actual virtue. And the result
was a world in which good people who weren't up to date on
current moral fashions were brought down by people whose
characters would make you recoil in horror if you could see
them.<br><br>One big contributing factor in the rise of political
correctness was the lack of other things to be morally pure
about. Previous generations of prigs had been prigs mostly
about religion and sex. But among the cultural elite these
were the deadest of dead letters by the 1980s; if you were
religious, or a virgin, this was something you tended to
conceal rather than advertise. So the sort of people who
enjoy being moral enforcers had become starved of things to
enforce. A new set of rules was just what they'd been
waiting for.<br><br>Curiously enough, the tolerant side of the 1960s left helped
create the conditions in which the intolerant side
prevailed. The relaxed social rules advocated by the old,
easy-going hippy left became the dominant ones, at least
among the elite, and this left nothing for the naturally
intolerant to be intolerant about.<br><br>Another possibly contributing factor was the fall of the
Soviet empire. Marxism had been a popular focus of moral
purity on the left before political correctness emerged as a
competitor, but the pro-democracy movements in Eastern Bloc
countries took most of the shine off it. Especially the fall
of the Berlin Wall in 1989. You couldn't be on the side of
the Stasi. I remember looking at the moribund Soviet Studies
section of a used bookshop in Cambridge in the late 1980s
and thinking "what will those people go on about now?" As it
turned out the answer was right under my nose.<br><br>One thing I noticed at the time about the first phase of
political correctness was that it was more popular with
women than men. As many writers (perhaps most eloquently
George Orwell) have observed, women seem more attracted than
men to the idea of being moral enforcers. But there was
another more specific reason women tended to be the
enforcers of political correctness. There was at this time a
great backlash against sexual harassment; the mid 1980s were
the point when the definition of sexual harassment was
expanded from explicit sexual advances to creating a
"hostile environment." Within universities the classic form
of accusation was for a (female) student to say that a
professor made her "feel uncomfortable." But the vagueness
of this accusation allowed the radius of forbidden behavior
to expand to include talking about heterodox ideas. Those
make people uncomfortable too.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#dddddd">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Was it sexist to propose that Darwin's greater male
variability hypothesis might explain some variation in human
performance? Sexist enough to get Larry Summers pushed out
as president of Harvard, apparently. One woman who heard the
talk in which he mentioned this idea said it made her feel
"physically ill" and that she had to leave halfway through.
If the test of a hostile environment is how it makes people
feel, this certainly sounds like one. And yet it does seem
plausible that greater male variability explains some of the
variation in human performance. So which should prevail,
comfort or truth? Surely if truth should prevail anywhere,
it should be in universities; that's supposed to be their
specialty; but for decades starting in the late 1980s the
politically correct tried to pretend this conflict didn't
exist.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#dddddd">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>Political correctness seemed to burn out in the second half
of the 1990s. One reason, perhaps the main reason, was that
it literally became a joke. It offered rich material for
comedians, who performed their usual disinfectant action
upon it. Humor is one of the most powerful weapons against
priggishness of any sort, because prigs, being humorless,
can't respond in kind. Humor was what defeated Victorian
prudishness, and by 2000 it seemed to have done the same
thing to political correctness.<br><br>Unfortunately this was an illusion. Within universities the
embers of political correctness were still glowing brightly.
After all, the forces that created it were still there. The
professors who started it were now becoming deans and
department heads. And in addition to their departments there
were now a bunch of new ones explicitly focused on social
justice. Students were still hungry for things to be morally
pure about. And there had been an explosion in the number of
university administrators, many of whose jobs involved
enforcing various forms of political correctness.<br><br>In the early 2010s the embers of political correctness burst
into flame anew. There were several differences between this
new phase and the original one. It was more virulent. It
spread further into the real world, although it still burned
hottest within universities. And it was concerned with a
wider variety of sins. In the first phase of political
correctness there were really only three things people got
accused of: sexism, racism, and homophobia (which at the
time was a neologism invented for the purpose). But between
then and 2010 a lot of people had spent a lot of time trying
to invent new kinds of -isms and -phobias and seeing which
could be made to stick.<br><br>The second phase was, in multiple senses, political
correctness metastasized. Why did it happen when it did? My
guess is that it was due to the rise of social media,
particularly Tumblr and Twitter, because one of the most
distinctive features of the second wave of political
correctness was the <i>cancel mob</i>: a mob of angry people
uniting on social media to get someone ostracized or fired.
Indeed this second wave of political correctness was
originally called "cancel culture"; it didn't start to be
called "wokeness" till the 2020s.<br><br>One aspect of social media that surprised almost everyone at
first was the popularity of outrage. Users seemed to <i>like</i>
being outraged. We're so used to this idea now that we take
it for granted, but really it's pretty strange. Being
outraged is not a pleasant feeling. You wouldn't expect
people to seek it out. But they do. And above all, they want
to share it. I happened to be running a forum from 2007 to
2014, so I can actually quantify how much they want to share
it: our users were about three times more likely to upvote
something if it outraged them.<br><br>This tilt toward outrage wasn't due to wokeness. It's an
inherent feature of social media, or at least this
generation of it. But it did make social media the perfect
mechanism for fanning the flames of wokeness.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#dddddd">7</font></a>]</font><br><br>It wasn't just public social networks that drove the rise of
wokeness though. Group chat apps were also critical,
especially in the final step, cancellation. Imagine if a
group of employees trying to get someone fired had to do it
using only email. It would be hard to organize a mob. But
once you have group chat, mobs form naturally.<br><br>Another contributing factor in this second wave of political
correctness was the dramatic increase in the polarization of
the press. In the print era, newspapers were constrained to
be, or at least seem, politically neutral. The department
stores that ran ads in the New York Times wanted to reach
everyone in the region, both liberal and conservative, so
the Times had to serve both. But the Times didn't regard
this neutrality as something forced upon them. They embraced
it as their duty as a <i>paper of record</i> — as one of the big
newspapers that aimed to be chronicles of their times,
reporting every sufficiently important story from a neutral
point of view.<br><br>When I grew up the papers of record seemed timeless, almost
sacred institutions. Papers like the New York Times and
Washington Post had immense prestige, partly because other
sources of news were limited, but also because they did make
some effort to be neutral.<br><br>Unfortunately it turned out that the paper of record was
mostly an artifact of the constraints imposed by print.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#dddddd">8</font></a>]</font>
When your market was determined by geography, you had
to be neutral. But publishing online enabled — in fact
probably forced — newspapers to switch to serving markets
defined by ideology instead of geography. Most that remained
in business fell in the direction they'd already been
leaning: left. On October 11, 2020 the New York Times
announced that "The paper is in the midst of an evolution
from the stodgy paper of record into a juicy collection of
great narratives."
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#dddddd">9</font></a>]</font>
Meanwhile journalists, of a sort,
had arisen to serve the right as well. And so journalism,
which in the previous era had been one of the great
centralizing forces, now became one of the great polarizing
ones.<br><br>The rise of social media and the increasing polarization of
journalism reinforced one another. In fact there arose a new
variety of journalism involving a loop through social media.
Someone would say something controversial on social media.
Within hours it would become a news story. Outraged readers
would then post links to the story on social media, driving
further arguments online. It was the cheapest source of
clicks imaginable. You didn't have to maintain overseas news
bureaus or pay for month-long investigations. All you had to
do was watch Twitter for controversial remarks and repost
them on your site, with some additional comments to inflame
readers further.<br><br>For the press there was money in wokeness. But they weren't
the only ones. That was one of the biggest differences
between the two waves of political correctness: the first
was driven almost entirely by amateurs, but the second was
often driven by professionals. For some it was their whole
job. By 2010 a new class of administrators had arisen whose
job was basically to enforce wokeness. They played a role
similar to that of the political commissars who got attached
to military and industrial organizations in the USSR: they
weren't directly in the flow of the organization's work, but
watched from the side to ensure that nothing improper
happened in the doing of it. These new administrators could
often be recognized by the word "inclusion" in their titles.
Within institutions this was the preferred euphemism for
wokeness; a new list of banned words, for example, would
usually be called an "inclusive language guide."
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#dddddd">10</font></a>]</font><br><br>This new class of bureaucrats pursued a woke agenda as if
their jobs depended on it, because they did. If you hire
people to keep watch for a particular type of problem,
they're going to find it, because otherwise there's no
justification for their existence.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#dddddd">11</font></a>]</font>
But these
bureaucrats also represented a second and possibly even
greater danger. Many were involved in hiring, and when
possible they tried to ensure their employers hired only
people who shared their political beliefs. The most
egregious cases were the new "DEI statements" that some
universities started to require from faculty candidates,
proving their commitment to wokeness. Some universities used
these statements as the initial filter and only even
considered candidates who scored high enough on them. You're
not hiring Einstein that way; imagine what you get instead.<br><br>Another factor in the rise of wokeness was the Black Lives
Matter movement, which started in 2013 when a white man was
acquitted after killing a black teenager in Florida. But
this didn't launch wokeness; it was well underway by 2013.<br><br>Similarly for the Me Too Movement, which took off in 2017
after the first news stories about Harvey Weinstein's
history of raping women. It accelerated wokeness, but didn't
play the same role in launching it that the 80s version did
in launching political correctness.<br><br>The election of Donald Trump in 2016 also accelerated
wokeness, particularly in the press, where outrage now meant
traffic. Trump made the New York Times a lot of money:
headlines during his first administration mentioned his name
at about four times the rate of previous presidents.<br><br>In 2020 we saw the biggest accelerant of all, after a white
police officer asphyxiated a black suspect on video. At this
point the metaphorical fire became a literal one, as violent
protests broke out across America. But in retrospect this
turned out to be peak woke, or close to it. By every measure
I've seen, wokeness peaked in 2020 or 2021.<br><br>Wokeness is sometimes described as a mind-virus. What makes
it viral is that it defines new types of impropriety. Most
people are afraid of impropriety; they're never exactly sure
what the social rules are or which ones they might be
breaking. Especially if the rules change rapidly. And since
most people already worry that they might be breaking rules
they don't know about, if you tell them they're breaking a
rule, their default reaction is to believe you. Especially
if multiple people tell them. Which in turn is a recipe for
exponential growth. Zealots invent some new impropriety to
avoid. The first people to adopt it are fellow zealots,
eager for new ways to signal their virtue. If there are
enough of these, the initial group of zealots is followed by
a much larger group, motivated by fear. They're not trying
to signal virtue; they're just trying to avoid getting in
trouble. At this point the new impropriety is now firmly
established. Plus its success has increased the rate of
change in social rules, which, remember, is one of the
reasons people are nervous about which rules they might be
breaking. So the cycle accelerates.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#dddddd">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>What's true of individuals is even more true of
organizations. Especially organizations without a powerful
leader. Such organizations do everything based on "best
practices." There's no higher authority; if some new "best
practice" achieves critical mass, they <i>must</i> adopt it. And
in this case the organization can't do what it usually does
when it's uncertain: delay. It might be committing
improprieties right now! So it's surprisingly easy for a
small group of zealots to capture this type of organization
by describing new improprieties it might be guilty of. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#dddddd">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>How does this kind of cycle ever end? Eventually it leads to
disaster, and people start to say enough is enough. The
excesses of 2020 made a lot of people say that.<br><br>Since then wokeness has been in gradual but continual
retreat. Corporate CEOs, starting with Brian Armstrong, have
openly rejected it. Universities, led by the University of
Chicago and MIT, have explicitly confirmed their commitment
to free speech. Twitter, which was arguably the hub of
wokeness, was bought by Elon Musk in order to neutralize it,
and he seems to have succeeded — and not, incidentally, by
censoring left-wing users the way Twitter used to censor
right-wing ones, but without censoring either.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f14n"><font color="#dddddd">14</font></a>]</font>
Consumers have emphatically rejected brands that ventured
too far into wokeness. The Bud Light brand may have been
permanently damaged by it. I'm not going to claim Trump's
second victory in 2024 was a referendum on wokeness; I think
he won, as presidential candidates always do, because he was
more <a href="charisma.html"><u>charismatic</u></a>; but voters' 
disgust with wokeness must have helped.<br><br>So what do we do now? Wokeness is already in retreat.
Obviously we should help it along. What's the best way to do
that? And more importantly, how do we avoid a third
outbreak? After all, it seemed to be dead once, but came
back worse than ever.<br><br>In fact there's an even more ambitious goal: is there a way
to prevent any similar outbreak of aggressively performative
moralism in the future — not just a third outbreak of
political correctness, but the next thing like it? Because
there will be a next thing. Prigs are prigs by nature. They
need rules to obey and enforce, and now that Darwin has cut
off their traditional supply of rules, they're constantly
hungry for new ones. All they need is someone to meet them
halfway by defining a new way to be morally pure, and we'll
see the same phenomenon again.<br><br>Let's start with the easier problem. Is there a simple,
principled way to deal with wokeness? I think there is: to
use the customs we already have for dealing with religion.
Wokeness is effectively a religion, just with God replaced
by protected classes. It's not even the first religion of
this kind; Marxism had a similar form, with God replaced by
the masses.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f15n"><font color="#dddddd">15</font></a>]</font>
And we already have well-established
customs for dealing with religion within organizations. You
can express your own religious identity and explain your
beliefs, but you can't call your coworkers infidels if they
disagree, or try to ban them from saying things that
contradict its doctrines, or insist that the organization
adopt yours as its official religion.<br><br>If we're not sure what to do about any particular
manifestation of wokeness, imagine we were dealing with some
other religion, like Christianity. Should we have people
within organizations whose jobs are to enforce woke
orthodoxy? No, because we wouldn't have people whose jobs
were to enforce Christian orthodoxy. Should we censor
<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/02/17/roald-dahl-books-rewritten-offensive-matilda-witches-twits/"><u>writers</u></a> or 
<a href="https://x.com/KoustaStavroula/status/1562034502897106946"><u>scientists</u></a> whose work contradicts woke doctrines?
No, because we wouldn't do this to people whose work
contradicted Christian teachings. Should job candidates be
required to write DEI statements? Of course not; imagine an
employer requiring proof of one's religious beliefs. Should
students and employees have to participate in woke
indoctrination sessions in which they're required to answer
questions about their beliefs to ensure compliance? No,
because we wouldn't dream of catechizing people in this way
about their religion.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f16n"><font color="#dddddd">16</font></a>]</font><br><br>One shouldn't feel bad about not wanting to watch woke
movies any more than one would feel bad about not wanting to
listen to Christian rock. In my twenties I drove across
America several times, listening to local radio stations.
Occasionally I'd turn the dial and hear some new song. But
the moment anyone mentioned Jesus I'd turn the dial again.
Even the tiniest bit of being preached to was enough to make
me lose interest.<br><br>But by the same token we should not automatically reject
everything the woke believe. I'm not a Christian, but I can
see that many Christian principles are good ones. It would
be a mistake to discard them all just because one didn't
share the religion that espoused them. It would be the sort
of thing a religious zealot would do.<br><br>If we have genuine pluralism, I think we'll be safe from
future outbreaks of woke intolerance. Wokeness itself won't
go away. There will for the foreseeable future continue to
be pockets of woke zealots inventing new moral fashions. The
key is not to let them treat their fashions as normative.
They can change what their coreligionists are allowed to say
every few months if they like, but they mustn't be allowed
to change what we're allowed to say.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f17n"><font color="#dddddd">17</font></a>]</font><br><br>The more general problem — how to prevent similar outbreaks
of aggressively performative moralism — is of course
harder. Here we're up against human nature. There will
always be prigs. And in particular there will always be the
enforcers among them, the 
<a href="conformism.html"><u>aggressively conventional-minded</u></a>.
These people are born that way. Every society has them. So
the best we can do is to keep them bottled up.<br><br>The aggressively conventional-minded aren't always on the
rampage. Usually they just enforce whatever random rules are
nearest to hand. They only become dangerous when some new
ideology gets a lot of them pointed in the same direction at
once. That's what happened during the Cultural Revolution,
and to a lesser extent (thank God) in the two waves of
political correctness we've experienced.<br><br>We can't get rid of the aggressively conventional-minded.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f18n"><font color="#dddddd">18</font></a>]</font>
And we couldn't prevent people from creating new
ideologies that appealed to them even if we wanted to. So if
we want to keep them bottled up, we have to do it one step
downstream. Fortunately when the aggressively
conventional-minded go on the rampage they always do one
thing that gives them away: they define new <a href="heresy.html"><u>heresies</u></a> to
punish people for. So the best way to protect ourselves from
future outbreaks of things like wokeness is to have powerful
antibodies against the concept of heresy.<br><br>We should have a conscious bias against defining new forms
of heresy. Whenever anyone tries to ban saying something
that we'd previously been able to say, our initial
assumption should be that they're wrong. Only our initial
assumption of course. If they can prove we should stop
saying it, then we should. But the burden of proof is on
them. In liberal democracies, people trying to prevent
something from being said will usually claim they're not
merely engaging in censorship, but trying to prevent some
form of "harm". And maybe they're right. But once again, the
burden of proof is on them. It's not enough to claim harm;
they have to prove it.<br><br>As long as the aggressively conventional-minded continue to
give themselves away by banning heresies, we'll always be
able to notice when they become aligned behind some new
ideology. And if we always fight back at that point, with
any luck we can stop them in their tracks.<br><br>The number of true things we <a href="say.html"><u>can't say</u></a>
should not increase. If it does, something is wrong.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
Why did 1960s radicals focus on the causes they did?
One of the people who reviewed drafts of this essay
explained this so well that I asked if I could quote him:
<blockquote>
  The middle-class student protestors of the New Left
  rejected the socialist/Marxist left as unhip. They were
  interested in sexier forms of oppression uncovered by
  cultural analysis (Marcuse) and abstruse "Theory". Labor
  politics became stodgy and old-fashioned. This took a
  couple generations to work through. The woke ideology's
  conspicuous lack of interest in the working class is the
  tell-tale sign. Such fragments as are, er, left of the old
  left are anti-woke, and meanwhile the actual working class
  shifted to the populist right and gave us Trump. Trump and
  wokeness are cousins.<br><br>The middle-class origins of wokeness smoothed its way
  through the institutions because it had no interest in
  "seizing the means of production" (how quaint such phrases
  seem now), which would quickly have run up against hard
  state and corporate power. The fact that wokeness only
  expressed interest in other kinds of class (race, sex,
  etc) signalled compromise with existing power: give us
  power within your system and we'll bestow the resource we
  control — moral rectitude — upon you. As an ideological
  stalking horse for gaining control over discourse and
  institutions, this succeeded where a more ambitious
  revolutionary program would not have.

It helped that the humanities and social sciences also
included some of the biggest and easiest undergrad majors.
If a political movement had to start with physics students,
it could never get off the ground; there would be too few of
them, and they wouldn't have the time to spare.<br><br>At the top universities these majors are not as big as they
used to be, though. A 
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/the-end-of-the-english-major"><u>2022 survey</u></a> found that only 7% of
Harvard undergrads plan to major in the humanities, vs
nearly 30% during the 1970s. I expect wokeness is at least
part of the reason; when undergrads consider majoring in
English, it's presumably because they love the written word
and not because they want to listen to lectures about
racism.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>]
The puppet-master-and-puppet character of political
correctness became clearly visible when a bakery near
Oberlin College was falsely accused of race discrimination
in 2016. In the subsequent civil trial, lawyers for the
bakery produced a text message from Oberlin Dean of Students
Meredith Raimondo that read "I'd say unleash the students if
I wasn't convinced this needs to be put behind us."<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>]
The woke sometimes claim that wokeness is simply
treating people with respect. But if it were, that would be
the only rule you'd have to remember, and this is comically
far from being the case. My younger son likes to imitate
voices, and at one point when he was about seven I had to
explain which accents it was currently safe to imitate
publicly and which not. It took about ten minutes, and I
still hadn't covered all the cases.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>]
In 1986 the Supreme Court ruled that creating a
hostile work environment could constitute sex
discrimination, which in turn affected universities via
Title IX. The court specified that the test of a hostile
environment was whether it would bother a reasonable person,
but since for a professor merely being the subject of a
sexual harassment complaint would be a disaster whether the
complainant was reasonable or not, in practice any joke or
remark remotely connected with sex was now effectively
forbidden. Which meant we'd now come full circle to
Victorian codes of behavior, when there was a large class of
things that might not be said "with ladies present."<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>]
Much as they tried to pretend there was no conflict
between diversity and quality. But you can't simultaneously
optimize for two things that aren't identical. What
diversity actually means, judging from the way the term is
used, is proportional representation, and unless you're
selecting a group whose purpose is to be representative,
like poll respondents, optimizing for proportional
representation has to come at the expense of quality. This
is not because of anything about representation; it's the
nature of optimization; optimizing for x has to come at the
expense of y unless x and y are identical.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>]
Maybe societies will eventually develop antibodies to
viral outrage. Maybe we were just the first to be exposed to
it, so it tore through us like an epidemic through a
previously isolated population. I'm fairly confident that it
would be possible to create new social media apps that were
less driven by outrage, and an app of this type would have a
good chance of stealing users from existing ones, because
the smartest people would tend to migrate to it.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>]
I say "mostly" because I have hopes that journalistic
neutrality will return in some form. There is some market
for unbiased news, and while it may be small, it's valuable.
The rich and powerful want to know what's really going on;
that's how they became rich and powerful.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>]
The Times made this momentous announcement very
informally, in passing in the middle of an 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/business/media/new-york-times-rukmini-callimachi-caliphate.html"><u>article</u></a> about a
Times reporter who'd been criticized for inaccuracy. It's
quite possible no senior editor even approved it. But it's
somehow appropriate that this particular universe ended with
a whimper rather than a bang.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>]
As the acronym DEI goes out of fashion, many of these
bureaucrats will try to go underground by changing their
titles. It looks like "belonging" will be a popular option.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>]
If you've ever wondered why our legal system includes
protections like the separation of prosecutor, judge, and
jury, the right to examine evidence and cross-examine
witnesses, and the right to be represented by legal counsel,
the de facto 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/magazine/title-ix-sexual-harassment-accusations.html">parallel legal system</a>
established by Title IX
makes that all too clear.<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>]
The invention of new improprieties is most visible in
the rapid evolution of woke nomenclature. This is
particularly annoying to me as a writer, because the new
names are always worse. Any religious observance has to be
inconvenient and slightly absurd; otherwise gentiles would
do it too. So "slaves" becomes "enslaved individuals." But
web search can show us the leading edge of moral growth in
real time: if you search for "individuals experiencing
slavery" you will as of this writing find five legit
attempts to use the phrase, and you'll even find two for
"individuals experiencing enslavement."<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>]
Organizations that do dubious things are particularly
concerned with propriety, which is how you end up with
absurdities like tobacco and oil companies having higher ESG
ratings than Tesla.<br><br>[<a name="f14n"><font color="#000000">14</font></a>]
Elon did something else that tilted Twitter rightward
though: he gave more visibility to paying users. Paying
users lean right on average, because people on the far left
dislike Elon and don't want to give him money. Elon
presumably knew this would happen. On the other hand, the
people on the far left have only themselves to blame; they
could tilt Twitter back to the left tomorrow if they wanted
to.<br><br>[<a name="f15n"><font color="#000000">15</font></a>]
It even, as James Lindsay and Peter Boghossian
pointed out, has a concept of original sin: privilege. Which
means unlike Christianity's egalitarian version, people have varying
degrees of it. An able-bodied straight white
American male is born with such a load of sin that only by
the most abject repentance can he be saved.<br><br>Wokeness also shares something rather funny with many actual
versions of Christianity: like God, the people for whose
sake wokeness purports to act are often revolted by the
things done in their name.<br><br>[<a name="f16n"><font color="#000000">16</font></a>]
There is one exception to most of these rules: actual
religious organizations. It's reasonable for them to insist
on orthodoxy. But they in turn should declare that they're
religious organizations. It's rightly considered shady
when something that appears to be an ordinary business or
publication turns out to be a religious organization.<br><br>[<a name="f17n"><font color="#000000">17</font></a>]
I don't want to give the impression that it will be
simple to roll back wokeness. There will be places where the
fight inevitably gets messy — particularly within
universities, which everyone has to share, yet which are
currently the most pervaded by wokeness of any institutions.<br><br>[<a name="f18n"><font color="#000000">18</font></a>]
You can however get rid of aggressively
conventional-minded people within an organization, and in
many if not most organizations this would be an excellent
idea. Even a handful of them can do a lot of damage. I bet
you'd feel a noticeable improvement going from a handful to
none.<br><br><br><br><font color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman,

That may seem a strange question, but it's not
meaningless or unanswerable. It's the sort of question kids ask
before they learn not to ask big questions. I only came across it
myself in the process of investigating something else. But once I
did, I thought I should at least try to answer it.<br><br>So what <i>should</i> one do? One should help people, and take care of
the world. Those two are obvious. But is there anything else? When
I ask that, the answer that pops up is <i>Make good new things</i>.<br><br>I can't prove that one should do this, any more than I can prove
that one should help people or take care of the world. We're talking
about first principles here. But I can explain why this principle
makes sense. The most impressive thing humans can do is to think.
It may be the most impressive thing that can be done. And the best
kind of thinking, or more precisely the best proof that one has
thought well, is to make good new things.<br><br>I mean new things in a very general sense. Newton's physics was a
good new thing. Indeed, the first version of this principle was to
have good new ideas. But that didn't seem general enough: it didn't
include making art or music, for example, except insofar as they
embody new ideas. And while they may embody new ideas, that's not
all they embody, unless you stretch the word "idea" so uselessly
thin that it includes everything that goes through your nervous
system.<br><br>Even for ideas that one has consciously, though, I prefer the
phrasing "make good new things." There are other ways to describe
the best kind of thinking. To make discoveries, for example, or to
understand something more deeply than others have. But how well do
you understand something if you can't make a model of it, or write
about it? Indeed, trying to express what you understand is not just
a way to prove that you understand it, but a way to understand it
better.<br><br>Another reason I like this phrasing is that it biases us toward
creation. It causes us to prefer the kind of ideas that are naturally
seen as making things rather than, say, making critical observations
about things other people have made. Those are ideas too, and
sometimes valuable ones, but it's easy to trick oneself into believing
they're more valuable than they are. Criticism seems sophisticated,
and making new things often seems awkward, especially at first; and
yet it's precisely those first steps that are most rare and valuable.<br><br>Is newness essential? I think so. Obviously it's essential in
science. If you copied a paper of someone else's and published it
as your own, it would seem not merely unimpressive but dishonest.
And it's similar in the arts. A copy of a good painting can be a
pleasing thing, but it's not impressive in the way the original
was. Which in turn implies it's not impressive to make the same
thing over and over, however well; you're just copying yourself.<br><br>Note though that we're talking about a different kind of should
with this principle. Taking care of people and the world are shoulds
in the sense that they're one's duty, but making good new things
is a should in the sense that this is how to live to one's full
potential. Historically most rules about how to live have been a
mix of both kinds of should, though usually with more of the former
than the latter. 
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#dddddd">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>For most of history the question "What should one do?" got much the
same answer everywhere, whether you asked Cicero or Confucius. You
should be wise, brave, honest, temperate, and just, uphold tradition,
and serve the public interest. There was a long stretch where in
some parts of the world the answer became "Serve God," but in
practice it was still considered good to be wise, brave, honest,
temperate, and just, uphold tradition, and serve the public interest.
And indeed this recipe would have seemed right to most Victorians.
But there's nothing in it about taking care of the world or making
new things, and that's a bit worrying, because it seems like this
question should be a timeless one. The answer shouldn't change much.<br><br>I'm not too worried that the traditional answers don't mention
taking care of the world. Obviously people only started to care
about that once it became clear we could ruin it. But how can making
good new things be important if the traditional answers don't mention
it?<br><br>The traditional answers were answers to a slightly different question.
They were answers to the question of how to be, rather than what
to do. The audience didn't have a lot of choice about what to do.
The audience up till recent centuries was the landowning class,
which was also the political class. They weren't choosing between
doing physics and writing novels. Their work was foreordained:
manage their estates, participate in politics, fight when necessary.
It was ok to do certain other kinds of work in one's spare time,
but ideally one didn't have any. Cicero's <i>De Officiis</i> is one of the
great classical answers to the question of how to live, and in it
he explicitly says that he wouldn't even be writing it if he hadn't
been excluded from public life by recent political upheavals.
<font color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#dddddd">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>There were of course people doing what we would now call "original
work," and they were often admired for it, but they weren't seen
as models. Archimedes knew that he was the first to prove that a
sphere has 2/3 the volume of the smallest enclosing cylinder and
was very pleased about it. But you don't find ancient writers urging
their readers to emulate him. They regarded him more as a prodigy
than a model.<br><br>Now many more of us can follow Archimedes's example and devote most
of our attention to one kind of work. He turned out to be a model
after all, along with a collection of other people that his
contemporaries would have found it strange to treat as a distinct
group, because the vein of people making new things ran at right
angles to the social hierarchy.<br><br>What kinds of new things count? I'd rather leave that question to
the makers of them. It would be a risky business to try to define
any kind of threshold, because new kinds of work are often despised
at first. Raymond Chandler was writing literal pulp fiction, and
he's now recognized as one of the best writers of the twentieth
century. Indeed this pattern is so common that you can use it as a
recipe: if you're excited about some kind of work that's not
considered prestigious and you can explain what everyone else is
overlooking about it, then this is not merely a kind of work that's
ok to do, but one to seek out.<br><br>The other reason I wouldn't want to define any thresholds is that
we don't need them. The kind of people who make good new things 
don't need rules to keep them honest.<br><br>So there's my guess at a set of principles to live by: take care
of people and the world, and make good new things. Different people
will do these to varying degrees. There will presumably be lots who
focus entirely on taking care of people. There will be a few who
focus mostly on making new things. But even if you're one of those,
you should at least make sure that the new things you make don't
net <i>harm</i> people or the world. And if you go a step further and
try to make things that help them, you may find you're ahead on the
trade. You'll be more constrained in what you can make, but you'll
make it with more energy.<br><br>On the other hand, if you make something amazing, you'll often be
helping people or the world even if you didn't mean to. Newton was
driven by curiosity and ambition, not by any practical effect his
work might have, and yet the practical effect of his work has been
enormous. And this seems the rule rather than the exception. So
if you think you can make something amazing, you should probably
just go ahead and do it.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>]
We could treat all three as the same kind of should by saying
that it's one's duty to live well — for example by saying, as some
Christians have, that it's one's duty to make the most of one's
God-given gifts. But this seems one of those casuistries people
invented to evade the stern requirements of religion: you could
spend time studying math instead of praying or performing acts of
charity because otherwise you were rejecting a gift God had given
you. A useful casuistry no doubt, but we don't need it.<br><br>We could also combine the first two principles, since people are
part of the world. Why should our species get special treatment?
I won't try to justify this choice, but I'm skeptical that anyone
who claims to think differently actually lives according to their
principles.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>]
Confucius was also excluded from public life after ending up
on the losing end of a power struggle, and presumably he too would
not be so famous now if it hadn't been for this long stretch of
enforced leisure.<br><br><br><br><font color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica
